Although maternal mortality ratios remain elevated in many areas, the maternal mortality ratio has decreased by 1.3 percent per year globally since 1990, with the greatest annualized rate of reduction in developed countries (-3.1 percent versus -1.4 percent in developing countries). During the same time period, however, the maternal mortality ratio in the United States increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maternal-mortality-and-morbidity/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Globally, reduction in maternal mortality has been attributed to reduction in the total fertility rate, increase in maternal education, and increased access to skilled birth attendants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maternal-mortality-and-morbidity/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Other factors associated with maternal mortality reduction include the promotion of policies to reduce anemia and malnutrition, prevent malaria in pregnancy, provide calcium and micronutrient supplementation, encourage delivery in facilities properly resourced for emergency obstetric care, discourage early motherhood, and reduce unsafe pregnancy termination. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The International Code of Diseases (ICD-10) definitions for maternal death and its subclassifications are as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maternal-mortality-and-morbidity/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Maternal death</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the duration and site of the pregnancy, from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management, but not from accidental or incidental causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maternal-mortality-and-morbidity/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Most (62 percent) maternal deaths occurred in sub-Saharan Africa (179,000 deaths) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maternal-mortality-and-morbidity/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Nearly a third of maternal deaths worldwide occurred in two countries: 17 percent in India (50,000 deaths in 2013) and 14 percent in Nigeria (40,000 deaths).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Late maternal death</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The death of a woman from direct or indirect obstetrical causes more than 42 days, but less than one year, after termination of pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1728169\"><span class=\"h2\">Pregnancy related death</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy, irrespective of the cause of death.

From the 2015 data set, the most common causes of maternal death were maternal hemorrhage, maternal hypertensive disorders, and other maternal disorders. In the 2003 to 2009 data set, hemorrhage accounted for 27.1 percent, hypertensive disorders 14.0 percent, and sepsis 10.7 percent of maternal deaths, with the remainder due to abortion (7.9 percent), embolism (3.2 percent), and all other direct causes of death (9.6 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maternal-mortality-and-morbidity/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H37833519\"><span class=\"h3\">Indirect obstetric death</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The terms nonmaternal, nonobstetrical, and indirect maternal death are used interchangeably with indirect obstetric death. An indirect obstetric death results from preexisting disease (eg, diabetes, cardiac disease, malaria, tuberculosis, HIV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maternal-mortality-and-morbidity/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]) or a new disease that develops during pregnancy and is unrelated to pregnancy-related conditions, but is aggravated by the physiologic effects of pregnancy (eg, influenza [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maternal-mortality-and-morbidity/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]). In 2015, indirect maternal deaths caused approximately 12 percent of all global maternal deaths, which is an increase from about 11 percent in 1990 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maternal-mortality-and-morbidity/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Deaths related to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection were responsible for a portion of the increase. </p><p>While conditions such as asthma and systemic lupus erythematosus are relatively common diseases in women, death during pregnancy from these conditions is uncommon unless associated with hypertension-related complications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Maternal mortality ratio</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The maternal mortality ratio (MMR) refers to the number of maternal deaths during a given time period per 100,000 live births. This is the most commonly used measure of maternal mortality and serves as an indicator of the risk for death once a woman has become pregnant. The denominator is live births rather than all pregnancies because of the difficulty in ascertaining the number of miscarriages and abortions in the population. </p><p>From 1990 to 2015, global maternal deaths decreased by 29 percent and the MMR decreased by 30 percent based on estimates compiled from data sources from 186 of 195 countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maternal-mortality-and-morbidity/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In 2015, the MMR for the world was 216 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births, which reflected a 2.3 percent annual decline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maternal-mortality-and-morbidity/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In 2015, regional MMRs ranged from approximately 12 maternal deaths per 100,000 livebirths for high-income regions to approximately 546 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births for sub-Saharan Africa. Country-specific MMR estimates ranged from 3 (Finland) to 1360 (Sierra Leone) per 100,000 live births. There were 24 countries that had a MMR of more than 400 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maternal-mortality-and-morbidity/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The need for continued efforts to eliminate preventable maternal deaths is highlighted by the gap between the Sustainable Development Goal of less than 70 maternal deaths per 100,000 livebirths globally by 2030 and the current MMR of low-performing regions, which is nearly 20 times the goal MMR. </p><p>The mean MMR for the United States in 2014 was 17.2 per 100,000 live births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maternal-mortality-and-morbidity/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Although the change in MMR from 1990 to 2013 represented a 1.7 percent annualized increase, improved identification of pregnancy-related deaths and changes in coding and classification may have accounted for most of this rise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maternal-mortality-and-morbidity/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. However, increases in maternal age, body mass index, and co-morbidities have increased and may also account for part of this rise. In a subsequent analysis of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention National Center for Health Statistics database and the Detailed Mortality Underlying Cause of Death database (CDC WONDER), the mean MMR rose from 14.3 in 2005 to 17.2 in 2014 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maternal-mortality-and-morbidity/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. While the cause(s) for the rise is not clear, factors that did not appear to contribute significantly to this increase included the proportion of rural women, immigration rates, cesarean delivery rates, and rates of medical conditions. This study also reported the rise in the MMR was greatest for non-Hispanic black women. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Race and ethnicity'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Maternal mortality rate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The maternal mortality rate is defined as the number of maternal deaths in a given period per 100,000 women of reproductive age (15 to 49 years of age) during the same time period. Since the frequency of pregnancy in women of childbearing age is a factor in calculating this rate, it is altered by differences in the frequency of pregnancy or birth in the population even though the risk of maternal death per <span class=\"nowrap\">pregnancy/birth</span> remains unchanged. Sierra Leone has the highest maternal mortality rate in the world: 1100 deaths per 100,000 births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maternal-mortality-and-morbidity/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Other countries with high maternal mortality rates include Chad (980 per 100,000), Central African Republic (880 per 100,000), Somalia (850 per 100,000), and Burundi (750 per 100,000).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Lifetime risk of maternal death</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The lifetime risk of maternal death takes into account the cumulative probability of dying as a result of pregnancy across a woman's reproductive years. It is calculated by multiplying the maternal mortality rate by the length of the reproductive period (approximately 35 years) [1- (1-maternal mortality rate)] [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maternal-mortality-and-morbidity/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In 2013, the lifetime risk of maternal death in sub-Saharan Africa was 1 in 31 compared with 1 in 3300 in Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maternal-mortality-and-morbidity/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">ASCERTAINMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The absence of high quality, population-based data is one of the challenges of measuring maternal mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maternal-mortality-and-morbidity/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. Maternal deaths are relatively rare events, even in countries where maternal mortality rates are high. Thus, sample sizes must be large to estimate both maternal mortality risks and contributors to maternal deaths.</p><p>Globally, several measures and surveillance methods are used to ascertain the magnitude of maternal mortality in a given region. These include medical certification in vital registration, household surveys (including sisterhood method), census records, and reproductive age mortality studies (RAMOS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maternal-mortality-and-morbidity/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Although many of these methods are imprecise, they provide some baseline information on the causes and magnitude of maternal deaths. Resource poor countries often apply their limited resources toward implementation of processes to decrease maternal mortality, rather than toward improvement of surveillance programs.</p><p>In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control Pregnancy Mortality Surveillance System (PMSS) combines data from state health departments, maternal mortality review committees, media, and individual providers, in addition to <span class=\"nowrap\">maternal/fetal</span> death certificates, to provide the best available assessment of maternal mortality in the United States.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Vital registration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Few developing countries have resources necessary to employ vital registration systems to assess levels and trends in maternal mortality. In developed countries, information about maternal mortality is determined primarily from vital registrations of deaths by causes. Nevertheless, maternal mortalities are still under-reported and frequently misclassified. In one study from the United States, 38 percent of maternal deaths were unreported on death certificates and at least 50 percent of maternal deaths were unreported among women who were undelivered at the time of death, experienced a fetal death or therapeutic abortion, died more than a week after delivery, or died as a result of a cardiovascular disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maternal-mortality-and-morbidity/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Confidential enquiries, such as the longstanding British surveillance system, are often used to determine the extent of misclassification of maternal death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maternal-mortality-and-morbidity/abstract/17-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Direct household surveys</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In areas where vital registration data are not available or reliable, household surveys provide an alternative method of maternal mortality assessment. However, surveys for direct estimation of maternal death are expensive and require large sample sizes to provide statistically reliable estimates. The sisterhood method is the most common method for household survey.</p><p>The sisterhood method asks four simple questions about survival of the respondents' adult sisters:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How many sisters have you ever had, born to the same mother, who ever reached the age 15 (or who were ever married), including those who are now dead?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How many of these sisters reaching age 15 are alive now?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How many of these sisters are dead?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How many of these dead sisters died during pregnancy or during childbirth, or during the six weeks after the end of the pregnancy?</p><p/><p>In high-fertility populations, this methodology is useful because sample size requirements (and thus costs) can be reduced. At high levels of maternal mortality (over 500 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births), a sample size of 4000 households or less is acceptable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maternal-mortality-and-morbidity/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The method is not appropriate for use in settings where the total fertility rate is less than four children per family; in areas of significant migration, civil strife, or war; or where other social disruptions exist.</p><p>Because deaths occurring over a large interval of time are being documented, the overall estimate of maternal mortality is determined for a period of 10 to 12 years before the survey [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maternal-mortality-and-morbidity/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. This method is still useful since maternal mortality generally changes slowly. Furthermore, it provides some data for settings where there are no alternative means of generating estimates.</p><p>Demographic health surveys may also employ the indirect sisterhood approach, which utilizes more in-depth questions. The indirect sisterhood method relies on fewer assumptions than the original sisterhood method, but requires a larger sample size; information gathering and analyses are also more complex. This method also does not provide a current estimate of maternal mortality, but the greater specificity of information allows for calculation of ratios for seven years prior to the survey.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Reproductive Age Mortality Studies (RAMOS)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The RAMOS method involves investigation of the cause of death for all women of reproductive age. It has been used to calculate the degree of misclassification of maternal deaths in countries with and without well-developed vital registration systems. Multiple methods and sources are applied to obtain a comprehensive sample. In countries without vital registration systems, interviews with household members and medical providers enable further classification of deaths as possibly maternal. This method is one of the most complete determinations of maternal deaths; however, it can be complicated and time-consuming to perform.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Verbal autopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Where medical classification of cause of death is limited or unavailable, some studies establish cause of death using verbal autopsy methodology. However, the reliability and validity of this method for determining the cause of death have not been established. The method may fail to address certain maternal deaths, such as first trimester deaths (ectopic, abortion-associated) or medical causes resulting from complications of terminations (eg, sepsis) and indirect causes (eg, HIV infection).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Census</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Decennial census level data may include questions on household deaths during an established reference period followed by more detailed questions that identify maternal deaths based on timing of death in relation to pregnancy, similar to verbal autopsy methodology. The advantage of this method is that it can generate national data relative to household characteristics.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Death certificate data</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States, a 2003 revision of the death certificate added questions to connect death certificates and ICD-10 coding. This revision expanded direct and indirect maternal deaths to also include &quot;late maternal deaths&quot; and &quot;pregnancy-related deaths&quot; (eg, not pregnant within past year; pregnant at time of death; not pregnant, but pregnant within 42 days of death; not pregnant, but pregnant 43 days to one year before death; unknown if pregnant within last year). The addition of these questions resulted in increased ascertainment of maternal deaths, particularly indirect, late maternal deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maternal-mortality-and-morbidity/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. Although these revisions were added in 2003, there was a time delay of three years or more for some states to adopt these death certificate revisions. As of 2017, 46 states and the District of Columbia had added the standard pregnancy checkbox question [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maternal-mortality-and-morbidity/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p>Even with these additions, state surveillance programs suggest that maternal death is underreported, often misclassified, and increasing in frequency in the United States. However, enhanced surveillance and many states adopting a standardized multidisciplinary maternal mortality review program are a likely contribution to the increase in reporting of maternal deaths.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study in Maryland found that check boxes on death certificates were effective in identifying pregnancy-associated deaths resulting from maternal causes, but were far less effective in identifying deaths resulting from nonmaternal causes, such as homicide, accidental death, and substance abuse, which represented three of the four leading causes of pregnancy-associated death in Maryland [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maternal-mortality-and-morbidity/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An observational study of United States death certificate maternal mortality data reported the estimated maternal mortality rate rose by nearly 27 percent between 2000 and 2014 in 48 states and the District of Columbia (maternal mortality rate per 100,000 live births: 18.8 in 2000 to 23.8 in 2014) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maternal-mortality-and-morbidity/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

The National Violent Death Reporting System reported 94 pregnancy-associated suicides and 139 pregnancy-associated homicides in the United States from 2003 to 2007, yielding maternal death rates of 2.0 and 2.9 deaths per 100,000 live births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maternal-mortality-and-morbidity/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

The pregnancy-related death ratio was 5.0 percent for overdose and 4.6 percent for suicide (both per 100,000 live births). Deaths were evenly distributed throughout the first postpartum year, with only six maternal deaths occurring during pregnancy itself. Similarly, a study from Ontario, Canada reported the maternal suicide rate was 2.58 per 100,000 live births, with suicide accounting for 51 (5.3 percent) of 966 maternal deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maternal-mortality-and-morbidity/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

From 2006 through 2010, pregnancy-related mortality ratios per 100,000 live births were 11.7 for Hispanic women, 12.0 for non-Hispanic white women, 14.2 for women of other races, and 38.9 for non-Hispanic black women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maternal-mortality-and-morbidity/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

These criteria are designed to trigger a response by an appropriately trained care team. The success of such a trigger-based system requires education and training for all clinical staff so they can identify the triggers, clearly identified clinical responders who react to such triggers, and a system for communication among the care teams. The purpose of an early warning system is to facilitate early diagnosis and treatment. These criteria do not identify every maternal complication nor are they designed to replace clinical judgment. In a prospective observational study of over 1000 deliveries, a maternal early warning charting system had positive and negative predictive values of 53.8 and 96.9 percent, respectively, for the identification of maternal morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maternal-mortality-and-morbidity/abstract/89,90\" class=\"abstract_t\">89,90</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1855448313\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A retrospective cohort study of over 67,000 deliveries in California reported that maternal age greater than 35 years, African American race, multiple gestation, and history of a prior cesarean delivery were risks factors for severe maternal morbidity (SMM) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maternal-mortality-and-morbidity/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. The most common obstetric complications associated with SMM were hemorrhage (42 percent), hypertensive disorders (20 percent), and placental hemorrhage (14 percent). For comparison, a study of over 6000 live births at a provincial hospital in Papua New Guinea, where maternal mortality is among the highest in the world, reported the following risk factors for a maternal near-miss event: maternal age &ge;30 years, nulliparity, illiteracy, residence in a rural community, lack of formal employment, referral from peripheral health facility, lack of registration for delivery, history of stillbirth, and anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maternal-mortality-and-morbidity/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. The study from Papua New Guinea highlights the impact of potentially reversible sociodemographic factors on maternal near-miss events. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H92294413\"><span class=\"h2\">Racial disparity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Racial disparities have been reported for SMM as well as mortality. In a case-control study using data from the United Kingdom Obstetric Surveillance System, the odds of SMM were 43 to 83 percent higher for different ethnic and racial groups compared with white European women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maternal-mortality-and-morbidity/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. In a population-based study of linked discharge and birth certificate data sets from New York City hospitals, the adjusted risk of SMM was twice as high for black women compared with white women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maternal-mortality-and-morbidity/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. Further analysis of risk-standardized SMM rates by hospital revealed that white women were more likely to give birth in a low-morbidity hospital compared with black women (65 percent of white births versus 23 percent of black births took place in hospitals with the lowest tertile of maternal morbidity). Similarly, another population study of New York City birth and discharge data sets reported that while Hispanic women had a 40 percent higher risk of severe maternal morbidity compared with non-Hispanic white women, up to 37 percent of the difference was estimated to result from differences in delivery location [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-maternal-mortality-and-morbidity/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. These studies suggest that hospital-level factors contribute to the disparity in maternal outcomes in addition to individual and population factors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maternal mortality, while uncommon in high-income countries, is a significant contributor to death in women in low-income countries.
