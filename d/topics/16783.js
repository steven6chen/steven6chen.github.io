Antigen is digested into peptides and bound to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on the surface of antigen presenting cells (APCs) for presentation to T cells. Recognition of self and foreign peptides by T cell receptor (TCR) complexes on immature thymocytes and mature T cells is necessary for the positive and negative selection of developing thymocytes and the functional responses of T cells. This topic briefly reviews signaling through the TCR complex, identifying the proteins involved and highlighting downstream targets of the signaling cascade.</p><p>TCR genetics, structure, and biology are covered in detail separately.

This engagement leads to a series of intracellular signaling events that culminate in the generation of a T cell response (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F66727\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66727 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-receptor-signaling/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>The Src-family protein tyrosine kinase Lck is first activated with resultant phosphorylation of CD3 coreceptor cytoplasmic domains, specifically at motifs known as immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs). These phosphorylated ITAMs on CD3-zeta serve as binding sites for the zeta chain-associated protein kinase, ZAP-70. ZAP-70 is activated by Lck-mediated phosphorylation and subsequent autophosphorylation. Activated ZAP-70 then phosphorylates a variety of <span class=\"nowrap\">linker/adapter</span> proteins, such as linker for activation of T cells (LAT) and Src-homology 2 domain-containing 76-kDa leukocyte protein (SLP-76). Further signaling proteins are then recruited, resulting in calcium mobilization, actin cytoskeleton reorganization, and activation of Ras guanosine triphosphate hydrolases (GTPases).</p><p>Downstream from these events, there is activation of transcription factors, such as nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT), activator protein 1 (AP-1), and nuclear factor kappa light-chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappa-B), with resultant alterations in the pattern of T cell gene expression, proliferation, and differentiation of effector function.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11026525\"><span class=\"h1\">EARLY SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The TCR is a heterodimer, with approximately 95 percent of peripheral blood T cells expressing an alpha and a beta chain. The alpha and beta chains of the TCR lack substantial cytoplasmic extensions and communicate with the interior of the cell through association with a group of single-span transmembrane proteins known as the CD3 family. CD3 gamma, delta, epsilon, and zeta form a complex with the TCR-alpha-beta receptor in a 1:1:2:2 ratio, respectively, for each TCR. In contrast to the TCR alpha and beta chains, the CD3 family members possess no known extracellular ligand-binding capacity, but have long cytoplasmic tails that serve as frameworks for intracellular signaling. The antigen-bound <span class=\"nowrap\">TCR/CD3</span> complex lacks intrinsic catalytic activity, and, therefore, initiation of signal transduction is critically dependent upon the activity of two protein tyrosine kinases: Lck and ZAP-70 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F62164\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62164 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F66727\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66727 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-receptor-signaling/abstract/4-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-12</a>].</p><p>Failure to express any member of the CD3 family results in some degree of immunodeficiency, often severe. CD3-gamma-deficient patients typically have near-normal T cell numbers, although with reduced <span class=\"nowrap\">TCR/CD3</span> complex expression, and show mild immunodeficiency. In contrast, complete CD3-epsilon, CD3-delta, and CD3-zeta deficiencies typically display a T-B+(natural killer [NK]+) severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). These all appear to result from an early block in T cell development. Partial deficiencies in expression of individual CD3 chains have been reported, typically with less severe immunodeficiency. NK cytotoxic function is also altered in CD3-zeta deficiency. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cd3-t-cell-receptor-complex-disorders-causing-immunodeficiency#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;CD3/T cell receptor complex disorders causing immunodeficiency&quot;, section on 'CD3 deficiency'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-specific-defects#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID): Specific defects&quot;, section on 'CD3 complex component deficiencies'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11026532\"><span class=\"h2\">Lck</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lck is a 56-kDa member of the Src-family tyrosine kinase family that is found constitutively associated with the cytoplasmic domain of the TCR coreceptors, CD4 and CD8 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F66727\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66727 \">figure 1</a>). It is activated rapidly following antigen binding to the TCR. Lck activity is absolutely required for normal T cell development and function.</p><p>Lck has two critically important roles in the initiation of TCR signaling. The first is phosphorylation of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) present in the cytoplasmic domains of the CD3 chains. These mediate interaction with other kinases (eg, CD3-epsilon ITAM binds the Src-family kinase Fyn, while ZAP-70 binds CD3-zeta) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-receptor-signaling/abstract/13-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-19</a>]. The second is phosphorylation of ZAP-70 on multiple residues subsequent to its recruitment to phosphorylated CD3-zeta chains, inducing activation of ZAP-70 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-receptor-signaling/abstract/13,18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,18-20</a>]. In addition to its initiatory role in TCR signaling, Lck also has other functions further downstream in the signaling pathway (eg, phosphorylation of the <span class=\"nowrap\">Emt/Itk</span> kinase).</p><p>Deficiency of Lck is reported to result in an immunodeficiency characterized by selective CD4 lymphopenia. Patients demonstrate the typical failure to thrive seen in SCID, opportunistic infections, and low to absent immunoglobulins. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cd3-t-cell-receptor-complex-disorders-causing-immunodeficiency#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;CD3/T cell receptor complex disorders causing immunodeficiency&quot;, section on 'p56lck deficiency'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=idiopathic-cd4-lymphocytopenia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Idiopathic CD4+ lymphocytopenia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The Lck protein is composed of a catalytic protein tyrosine kinase domain, a Src-homology 2 (SH2) domain that recognizes phosphorylated tyrosine residues in the general context TyrXXLeu, and a Src-homology 3 (SH3) domain that can bind proline rich motifs, generally with the pattern ProXProXXPro (where X equals any amino acid). Lck undergoes lipid modification during synthesis, with N-terminal myristoylation anchoring it to the inner leaflet of the T cell plasma membrane.</p><p>There are two main tyrosine phosphorylation sites on Lck itself, residues 394 and 505. Tyr394 is an autophosphorylation site on the activation loop of the Lck catalytic domain, (Tyr394 phosphorylation results in Lck activation). Phosphorylation of the activation loop causes it to be repelled from the mouth of the catalytic site, enhancing substrate access. In contrast, Tyr505 undergoes negative regulatory phosphorylation by the c-Src kinase (Csk), leading to a &quot;closed&quot; conformation of Lck. The phosphorylated residue is bound by the Lck SH2 domain, folding up the protein into a conformation that blocks substrate access to the active site.</p><p>The interplay between Tyr394 and Tyr505 phosphorylation in regulating Lck catalytic activity is complex. Modification of Tyr505 alone is insufficient to turn off Lck. Rather, phosphorylation of Tyr505 appears to merely shift the dynamic equilibrium between an open and closed conformation to favor more time spent in the closed state. Dephosphorylation of Tyr394 must also occur to completely downregulate Lck catalytic activity. To this end, the tyrosine phosphatase PTPN22 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-receptor-signaling/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>] is believed to act in a complex with Csk to regulate Lck (and other Src-kinase family members). A variant allele of the PTPN22 phosphatase encoding an arginine to tryptophan alteration (R620W), relatively common in the Caucasian population, is linked to increased susceptibility to the development of autoimmunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-receptor-signaling/abstract/22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-25</a>]. The R620W allele of PTPN22 is a reported gain-of-function variant with increased catalytic activity that accelerates the downregulation of Lck activity subsequent to engagement of the TCR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-receptor-signaling/abstract/22-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-27</a>].</p><p>Furthering the regulation of early signaling events, a transmembrane adaptor protein phosphoprotein associated with glycosphingolipid microdomains <span class=\"nowrap\">(PAG/Cbp)</span> is basally tyrosine phosphorylated in resting human T cells and subsequently bound by the SH2 domain of Csk, maintaining Csk at the plasma membrane. <span class=\"nowrap\">PAG/Cbp</span> undergoes rapid dephosphorylation following TCR stimulation, with accompanying loss of Csk binding and recruitment to the membrane, permitting TCR signaling to proceed. Overexpression of PAG inhibits TCR-mediated responses. Cbp phosphorylation is regulated by the Src-kinase family member Fyn [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-receptor-signaling/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].</p><p>Early models of TCR signaling suggested that Lck was activated by interaction with the receptor tyrosine phosphatase CD45 following TCR recognition of <span class=\"nowrap\">antigen/major</span> histocompatibility complex (MHC), removing negative regulatory phosphorylation from the kinase. However, subsequent findings suggest that a large percentage of thymocytes and resting T cells already contain a large pool of preactivated Lck, priming them for a rapid response. Conformational changes releasing constraints on Lck, or changes promoting Lck interaction with CD3 cytoplasmic domains, are now believed to initiate signal transduction. Studies demonstrate a close electrostatic-based interaction between the unactivated CD3-epsilon cytoplasmic domain and the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane, resulting in the insertion of key tyrosines into the lipid bilayer, potentially segregating them from Lck [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-receptor-signaling/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11026539\"><span class=\"h2\">ZAP-70</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An appreciation of the role of ZAP-70 in the biology of T cells and in TCR signaling came first from the description of a human deficiency of ZAP-70. This deficiency results in an unusual combined immunodeficiency where normal CD4+ T cells counts are present in the periphery, but CD8+ T cells are absent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-receptor-signaling/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. ZAP-70-deficient thymi have normal architecture, but single-positive CD8+ cells are absent from the medulla [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-receptor-signaling/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>] due to a block between double-negative and double-positive cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-receptor-signaling/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. CD4+ peripheral T cells are nonfunctional, and patients require hematopoietic stem cell replacement (ie, transplantation) to generate a functional T cell pool. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zap-70-deficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ZAP-70 deficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The ZAP-70 tyrosine kinase is recruited to the TCR complex following ITAM phosphorylation of the CD3-zeta chain by Lck [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-receptor-signaling/abstract/16,17,35-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17,35-38</a>]. ZAP-70 possesses tandem SH2 domains that bind the phosphorylated CD3-zeta ITAM motif. ITAMs are four amino acid SH2 domain binding sequences, <span class=\"nowrap\">YXX(L/V)</span> that occur as a pair and are separated by a six to nine residue spacer region. Two SH2 domains were predicted in the ZAP-70 structure, but radiograph crystallographic analysis demonstrated that only one of these bound in the predicted manner, forming a specific pocket to enclose one of the phosphorylated tyrosine residues of CD3-zeta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-receptor-signaling/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The second ZAP-70 SH2 domain formed an incomplete pocket, with atypical binding of the second phosphorylated tyrosine observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-receptor-signaling/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>Following binding to CD3-zeta, ZAP-70 undergoes phosphorylation at specific tyrosine residues, primarily by Lck, but also as the result of transautophosphorylation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-receptor-signaling/abstract/35,40-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,40-43</a>]. Much of the increase in ZAP-70 kinase activity following TCR stimulation is associated with the specific phosphorylation of Tyr493 in the activation loop of the ZAP-70 catalytic domain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-receptor-signaling/abstract/40-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-43</a>], although the act of binding CD3-zeta also causes conformational changes that increase activity. Binding to the phosphorylated CD3-zeta ITAM may further serve to fully expose Lck regulatory phosphorylation sites.</p><p>Phosphorylation of Tyr315 and Tyr319 within ZAP-70 also promotes TCR signal transduction by functioning as binding sites for downstream molecules: Tyr315 for the Vav guanine nucleotide exchange factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-receptor-signaling/abstract/44-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-46</a>] and Tyr 319 for phospholipase C&gamma; 1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-receptor-signaling/abstract/44,47-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,47-49</a>], presumably directing access for their phosphorylation by the ZAP-70 kinase domain.</p><p>ZAP-70 enzymatic activity is also negatively regulated by phosphorylation at Tyr492 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-receptor-signaling/abstract/40,41,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41,50</a>]. Furthermore, phosphorylation of Tyr292 has been shown to downregulate ZAP-70 function by serving as a binding site for the ubiquitin ligase, Cbl. The E3-ubiquitin ligase Cbl modifies ZAP-70 through ubiquitylation of lysine residues, targeting it for proteasomal degradation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-receptor-signaling/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>]. Cbl negatively regulates the activation of a number of TCR signal transducing proteins by inducing their degradation. ZAP-70 activity also appears to be downregulated as a result of the removal of activating tyrosine phosphorylation by cytoplasmic tyrosine phosphatases, including PTPN22 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-receptor-signaling/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11026546\"><span class=\"h1\">DISTAL CASCADE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Engagement of the <span class=\"nowrap\">TCR/CD3</span> complex by peptide major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) and subsequent activation of Lck and ZAP-70 kinases trigger a signaling cascade within the cell. This cascade culminates in the activation of pathways inducing transcription factor activity, with subsequent proliferation, differentiation, and cytokine secretion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F66727\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66727 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>The three major enzymatic pathways activated by TCR ligation are the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), the Rho family guanosine triphosphate hydrolases (GTPases), and phosphoinositol-regulated pathways. These pathways send signals into the nucleus via transcription factors, such as activator protein 1 (AP-1, dimer of Jun and Fos) and the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NF-AT).</p><p>The downstream interactions result in signal amplification and culminate in the transcription of genes required for T cell activation and initiation of T cell-specific responses, such as CD69 upregulation and interleukin-2 (IL-2) secretion in mature na&iuml;ve T cells. The molecules and processes involved in the subsequent downstream cascade continue to be identified.</p><p>ZAP-70-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation events are required for the mobilization of intracellular free calcium ([Ca<sup>2</sup>+]i) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-receptor-signaling/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>] and activation of the <span class=\"nowrap\">Ras/MAPK</span> and phosphatidylinositol-3 (PI-3) kinase pathways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-receptor-signaling/abstract/53-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">53-60</a>].

The Ras guanyl nucleotide-releasing protein (RasGRP) is also recruited to the plasma membrane upon generation of diacylglycerol (DAG) and activated by protein kinase C (PKC)-theta-mediated serine phosphorylation.</p><p>SLP-76 is also an adaptor protein, recruiting ITK, Gads, Vav, and Nck to the LAT signalosome. In association with Vav, SLP-76 and LAT lead to activation of the Rho family of small GTPases, cdc42 and Rac1. These function in cytoskeletal reorganization. SLP-76 and LAT also link the TCR to activation of PI-3 kinase. PI3-kinase modifies membrane phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) lipids, phosphorylating the 3' position hydroxyl group of the inositol ring.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11026560\"><span class=\"h2\">Lipid and lipid derived messengers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Generation of 3'-phosphorylated-inositol lipids in the plasma membrane can create binding sites for signaling molecules possessing a PtdIns-binding pleckstrin homology (PH) domain, including the cytoplasmic expressed in mast and T <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/IL-2-inducible</span> T cell tyrosine kinase <span class=\"nowrap\">(Emt/Itk)</span> that is recruited to the membrane following TCR activation. <span class=\"nowrap\">Emt/Itk</span> also binds the membrane adapter LAT via its SH2 domain, after phosphorylation of LAT by ZAP-70. <span class=\"nowrap\">Emt/Itk</span> is subsequently activated via Lck-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation. <span class=\"nowrap\">Emt/Itk-deficient</span> mice display compromised PLC-gamma-1 phosphorylation and reduced extracellular calcium flux in response to TCR stimulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-receptor-signaling/abstract/65-69\" class=\"abstract_t\">65-69</a>].</p><p>PI3-kinase activity is also responsible for PH domain-dependent recruitment of PLC-gamma-1 in response to TCR engagement through the generation of phosphatidylinositol(3,4,5)trisphosphate in the plasma membrane.

PH domain-mediated docking to the plasma membrane also recruits phosphoinositide dependent kinase 1 (PDK1) and its substrate Akt (also called protein kinase B,PKB), activating this survival promoting pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-receptor-signaling/abstract/70,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">70,71</a>].</p><p>PLC-gamma-1 cleaves phosphatidylinositol(4,5)bisphosphate into DAG and inositol triphosphate (IP3). Membrane-bound DAG activates members of the PKC family, in particular PKC-theta, which plays important roles in activation of Ras and the transcription factor nuclear factor kappa light-chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-kappa-B). In unstimulated cells, NF-kappa-B is sequestered to the cytoplasm by interaction with the inhibitor of kappa-B (I-kappa-B). NF-kappa-B activation requires I-kappa-B degradation. In a signal cascade, DAG-activated PKC-theta phosphorylates the I-kappa-B kinase IKK, which in turn phosphorylates I-kappa-B, causing its ubiquitination and subsequent degradation, freeing NF-kappa-B to translocate into the nucleus. DAG also recruits Ras guanyl nucleotide-releasing protein (RasGRP) to the membrane where the guanine release factor undergoes PKC-theta-mediated activating phosphorylation and helps activate the Ras signaling pathway.</p><p>Soluble IP3 mobilizes calcium from intracellular storage sites by binding to IP3 receptors on the surface of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11026567\"><span class=\"h2\">Calcium</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sustained elevation of cytosolic levels of free calcium (Ca<sup>2</sup>+) plays a critical role in promoting TCR signaling.

As examples, the <span class=\"nowrap\">TCR/CD3</span> complex and associated signaling proteins cluster into a &quot;central supramolecular activation cluster&quot; (c-SMAC), while lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1 (LFA-1) integrin is found in a peripheral SMAC (p-SMAC) that forms a ring of adhesion between the cells. The maintenance of an intact IS for many hours appears to be required for the effective activation of the T cell, although the identity of the particular APC (eg, dendritic cell, macrophage, B cell) may significantly affect requirements. The stable synapse may also provide a focal point for focused secretion and endocytosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antigen-presenting-cells\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antigen-presenting cells&quot;</a>.)</p><p>TCR signaling-induced rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton plays a critical role in decreasing T cell motility, in the molecular segregation of the T cell surface receptors, and in spatial organization of intracellular signaling components. Even prior to the formation of the mature IS, activated <span class=\"nowrap\">TCR/CD3</span> complexes form microclusters that localize into the c-SMAC in a process dependent upon actin polymerization. Thus, early signaling events prepare the platform for sustained distal signaling and T cell responses. Evidence suggests that the c-SMAC have an active TCR signaling zone and a TCR downregulating zone that uses ubiquitination machinery. PKC-theta and Wiskott&ndash;Aldrich syndrome protein (WASp) activity critically regulate synapse stability. Immunologic synapses are hyperstable in PKC-theta-deficient T cells, while they are unstable in WASp-deficient cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-receptor-signaling/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>].</p><p>Wiskott&ndash;Aldrich syndrome, or WASp deficiency, is an X-linked immunodeficiency in humans characterized by increased susceptibility to infections, eczema, thrombocytopenia, and decreased antibody production. Patients also display autoimmune disease and an increased incidence of malignancy, although the type of <em>WAS</em> mutation correlates significantly with the degree of disease severity. WASp-deficient T cells show impaired proliferation and actin rearrangement. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=wiskott-aldrich-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>TCR-mediated activation of T cell adhesion molecules such as LFA-1 is also critical to IS formation. The mechanism by which inside-out signaling to activate LFA-1 operates is unclear but involves activation of the Rac GTP exchange factor (GEF) Vav and the Rap1 GEF, C3G. Rap1 may be recruited to the plasma membrane by the adhesion and degranulation-promoting adaptor <span class=\"nowrap\">protein/Src</span> kinase-associated phosphoprotein of 55 kDa <span class=\"nowrap\">(ADAP/SKAP55)</span> adapter protein complex.</p><p>For a more detailed review of TCR signaling kinetics at the synapse, see [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-receptor-signaling/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11026581\"><span class=\"h1\">TCR SIGNALING IN T CELL ONTOGENY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The <span class=\"nowrap\">TCR/CD3</span> complex is not only absolutely required for the proper function of mature T cells, but also plays a significant role in T cell ontogeny (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F76102\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76102 \">figure 3</a>).

This is dependent upon recombinase-activating genes 1 and 2 (<em>RAG1</em> and <em>RAG2</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-receptor-signaling/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Failure to correctly rearrange the TCR-beta locus as a result of defective RAG enzyme activity results in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) that often presents as Omenn syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-receptor-signaling/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=t-b-nk-scid-pathogenesis-and-genetics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;T-B-NK+ SCID: Pathogenesis and genetics&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The differentiating thymocyte identifies functional rearrangement of the TCR-beta gene by its ability to signal. The rearranged TCR-beta chain associates with an invariant pre-TCR-alpha (pT-alpha) chain to form an active pre-TCR complex with CD3 chains that is hypothesized to signal in a nonligand-dependent manner. This may be due to a high potential for self-multimerization, conferring autonomous signaling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-receptor-signaling/abstract/81,82\" class=\"abstract_t\">81,82</a>]. Signaling through the pre-TCR complex involves many of the same proteins critical to mature TCR signaling including ZAP-70, linker for activation of T cells (LAT), Lck, Fyn, and phospholipase C gamma 1 (PLC-gamma-1), although their relative importance may vary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-receptor-signaling/abstract/83-86\" class=\"abstract_t\">83-86</a>]. Pre-TCR signals promote thymocyte survival and proliferation, expression of CD4 and CD8 coreceptors, rearrangement of TCR-alpha, and also induce a process known as allelic exclusion, whereby rearrangement of the second TCR-beta allele is prevented. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=t-cell-receptor-genetics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;T cell receptor genetics&quot;</a>.)</p><p>T cell precursors in the thymus with correctly rearranged TCR alpha and beta chains undergo positive and negative selection processes before they mature into CD4+ or CD8+ T cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-receptor-signaling/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. The fate of these cells is determined in large part by the interaction of the <span class=\"nowrap\">TCR/CD3</span> complex with self-antigens presented by thymic epithelial cells. Strong interaction and, as a result, a <span class=\"nowrap\">prolonged/high</span> level of TCR signaling in the thymocyte indicates that there is the potential for autoreactivity, and these cells are deleted (negative selection). A weak to moderate interaction between the thymocyte and self-antigen presenting epithelial cells allows the cells to mature (positive selection). Levels of phosphorylated (activated) ZAP-70 and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) activation have been identified as critical signaling events linked to the selection process. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-b-and-t-lymphocyte-development\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal B and T lymphocyte development&quot;</a>.)</p><p>CD3 or TCR chain deficiency may prevent the proper interaction of the precursors with the thymic epithelium, therefore eliminating the selection process.

It is critical to B cell receptor (BCR) signaling and functions in B cells in a manner fairly analogous to ZAP-70 in T cells. In murine thymocytes, Syk plays a role in TCR signaling. Syk binds phosphorylated immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) and can be activated by pre-TCR and TCR stimulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-cell-receptor-signaling/abstract/5,13,91\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,13,91</a>].

Themis-deficient mice have few thymocytes, with a defect in positive selection, resulting in fewer mature thymocytes. Themis undergoes rapid tyrosine phosphorylation that is dependent upon LAT and Src-homology 2 domain-containing 76-kDa leukocyte protein (SLP-76) and interacts with LAT, PLC-gamma-1, Grb2 and inducible T cell kinase (ITK). The precise role of Themis in TCR signaling is still unclear, but T cells lacking <em>THEMIS</em> gene expression demonstrate reduced interleukin-2 (IL-2) expression following TCR stimulation as a result of reduced extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK) and nuclear factor of activated T cells <span class=\"nowrap\">(NF-AT)/activator</span> protein 1 (AP-1) signaling.
