It typically affects young adults, and, although any organ may be affected, the disorder commonly presents with one or more of the following three abnormalities:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bilateral hilar adenopathy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary infiltrates</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> eye lesions</p><p/><p>Musculoskeletal disease is a less common problem.

Chronic arthritis and other musculoskeletal manifestations may also occur.</p><p>The articular manifestations of sarcoidosis and the diagnosis, differential diagnosis, and treatment of sarcoid arthropathy will be reviewed here. General issues related to sarcoidosis and its pathogenesis, as well as the muscular, skeletal, vasculitic, and other rheumatic manifestations of sarcoidosis, including discussions of diagnosis and treatment, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonary-sarcoidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of pulmonary sarcoidosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-sarcoidosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology and pathogenesis of sarcoidosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sarcoid-muscle-bone-and-vascular-disease-manifestations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sarcoid: Muscle, bone, and vascular disease manifestations&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3405236666\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3085326157\"><span class=\"h2\">Frequency of musculoskeletal sarcoid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 10 to 15 percent of patients with sarcoidosis have an associated arthropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-arthropathy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. One or more musculoskeletal manifestations, including arthropathy, bone lesions, muscular disease, and vasculitis, have been estimated to be present in up to 38 percent of patients with sarcoidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-arthropathy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, the true incidence and prevalence are unclear since the diagnosis may be difficult when a patient presents with articular complaints alone; in this setting, the presence of sarcoidosis is established only after more commonly involved organs, such as the eye or lung, become affected.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute arthritis and Lofgren's syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute sarcoid arthritis presents most often as part of Lofgren's syndrome, which is characterized by the triad of hilar adenopathy, acute arthritis, and erythema nodosum; the acute form of arthritis occurs less commonly in isolation or with parenchymal lung involvement. The acute polyarthritis most commonly involves ankles (&gt;90 percent), often bilaterally, followed by other larger joints of lower extremity, and may be mistaken for a reactive arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-arthropathy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The arthritis is mostly oligoarticular (87 percent), and involvement is typically symmetrical (76 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-arthropathy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Lofgren's syndrome is seen in less than 5 to 10 percent of sarcoidosis and is usually self-limiting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-arthropathy/abstract/1,4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,5</a>]. The erythema nodosum typically disappears in a few months, but the joint symptoms may persist up to two years. Approximately one-third of patients have a more persistent arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-arthropathy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]; rarely, the arthritic symptoms are recurrent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-arthropathy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Joint involvement in Lofgren's syndrome is the most common presentation of acute sarcoid arthritis. It most commonly presents as arthritis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> periarthritis involving both ankles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-arthropathy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Hilar lymphadenopathy in these patients tends to resolve over time in up to 90 percent of patients, with only few reporting worsening of lung disease or lymphadenopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-arthropathy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Erythema nodosum is more often seen in female compared with male patients presenting with Lofgren's syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-arthropathy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Reports of seasonal clusters of this syndrome suggest that an infectious or environmental agent, as yet unknown, may be pathogenetically important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-arthropathy/abstract/3,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8</a>].</p><p>Among a group of patients with arthritis of less than two years&rsquo; duration, the prevalence of sarcoidosis was 4.4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-arthropathy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In a prospective study of 189 patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of reactive arthritis, 17 (9 percent) were eventually diagnosed with acute sarcoid arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-arthropathy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Ten had Lofgren's syndrome, and all 17 had bilateral ankle involvement. A prospective cohort study of patients with recent-onset arthritis found that the presence of symptoms for less than two months, symmetrical ankle arthritis, and age less than 40 years had a high sensitivity (85 percent) and specificity (99 percent) for sarcoid arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-arthropathy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Hence, the next step in the evaluation of a young adult presenting with acute, bilateral, ankle arthritis with or without tender red nodules on the shin is a chest radiograph to look for hilar lymphadenopathy. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Occasionally, isolated involvement of the small joints of the hands may mimic the acute onset of rheumatoid arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-arthropathy/abstract/6,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,10</a>]. Among such patients, the diagnosis of acute sarcoid arthritis is most frequently made in retrospect when other, more common features of the disease become apparent. Sarcoid arthritis can resemble rheumatic fever when the polyarthritis is migratory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-arthropathy/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Young children presenting with both uveitis and arthritis may resemble patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-arthropathy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Hilar adenopathy is uncommon in sarcoidosis in early childhood. Arthritis, however, is a prominent feature that is accompanied by uveitis and rash [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-arthropathy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. When this syndrome appears in the first decade of life (usually before age four), it may represent early-onset sarcoidosis, a sporadic form of Blau syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=periodic-fever-syndromes-and-other-autoinflammatory-diseases-an-overview#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Periodic fever syndromes and other autoinflammatory diseases: An overview&quot;, section on 'Blau syndrome'</a>.)</p><p>Approximately 15 percent of patients with Lofgren's syndrome have elevated angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) levels at presentation, and those with elevated ACE levels may tend to have a more persistent arthritis. This presentation is associated with an increased prevalence of certain human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DR and DQ alleles (DQ2 and DR3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-arthropathy/abstract/3,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,13</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythema-nodosum\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Erythema nodosum&quot;</a>). Acute arthritis sometime presents with a rare (1 to 2 percent) febrile arthropathy in association with enlarged parotid glands, facial nerve palsy, and uveitis called uveoparotid fever (Heerfordt&rsquo;s syndrome) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-arthropathy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Lofgren&rsquo;s syndrome has an association with the presence of HLA-DQB1*0201 and specific polymorphisms of C-C chemokine receptor 2 (CCR2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-arthropathy/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. In a study of patients from the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, DQB1*0201 positivity was associated with a better outcome and greater likelihood of Lofgren&rsquo;s syndrome than DQB1*0201 negativity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-arthropathy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. DQB1*0201-negative patients took longer to recover and were more likely to need treatment at an early stage. In a series of 301 Swedish patients with Lofgren&rsquo;s syndrome, DRB1*03 positivity was associated with a better outcome than DRB1*03 negativity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-arthropathy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-leukocyte-antigens-hla-a-roadmap#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human leukocyte antigens (HLA): A roadmap&quot;, section on 'Class II region'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic arthritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic arthritis is an uncommon (1 to 2 percent) clinical manifestation of sarcoidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-arthropathy/abstract/5,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,17</a>] and is frequently associated with parenchymal pulmonary and cutaneous manifestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-arthropathy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]; elevated serum concentrations of ACE are found in up to 50 percent of such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-arthropathy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The correlation between extremely high serum ACE levels and extrathoracic sarcoidosis, including chronic arthritis, probably reflects the high total body load of granulomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-arthropathy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Different forms of chronic arthritis can occur among patients with sarcoidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-arthropathy/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nondeforming arthritis with granulomatous synovitis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Jaccoud's type deformity of the hands (nonerosive joint deformity)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Joint swelling adjacent to a sarcoid bone lesion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dactylitis (sausage-like swelling of one or more digits)</p><p/><p>Patients presenting with chronic arthritis are typically older than patients with acute arthritis or Lofgren's syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-arthropathy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The ankle, knees, hands, wrist, and metacarpophalangeal and proximal interphalangeal joints are the joints most frequently involved; rarely, the sacroiliac and temporomandibular joints may also be affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-arthropathy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The presentation of chronic arthritis (more than six months in duration) may be polyarticular or oligoarticular; it can be associated with joint erosions and osseous changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-arthropathy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Acute and chronic gouty arthritis has also been reported in association with sarcoid, but this is rare, and coincidental co-occurrence cannot be excluded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-arthropathy/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. Sarcoid manifested as podagra, mimicking gout, has also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-arthropathy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1824774074\"><span class=\"h2\">Tenosynovitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tenosynovitis may occur in the absence of arthritis, and clinical swelling is frequently due to tenosynovitis (eg, at the ankle) rather than arthritis. Reported anatomic sites of tenosynovitis include the Achilles tendon and the flexor tendons of the fingers and wrist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-arthropathy/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. One ultrasonographic study of 24 patients with acute sarcoid arthritis, 16 of whom had Lofgren&rsquo;s syndrome, found that six had joint effusions of the ankle that could be demonstrated only by ultrasound, while eight had findings of tenosynovitis, and 20 of the 24 had abnormalities (hypoechogenic structures) predominantly within the subcutis and periarticular tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-arthropathy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3175740723\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Synovial fluid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Joint effusions may occur among patients with sarcoidosis but are uncommon. Synovial fluid in patients with arthritis is typically mildly inflammatory, with either neutrophilic or lymphocytic predominance, but may be noninflammatory in some patients with chronic arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-arthropathy/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].</p><p>Large joint effusions are infrequent. Synovial fluid analysis is most consistent with a mildly inflammatory effusion, which, on occasion, may be bloody [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-arthropathy/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=synovial-fluid-analysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Synovial fluid analysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3175740723\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plain radiographs of the hands and other joints are mostly normal, except that soft tissue swelling may be identified. No erosions or joint space narrowing are seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-arthropathy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Cystic phalangeal lesions may be present but are not well-correlated with symptoms or with arthritis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sarcoid-muscle-bone-and-vascular-disease-manifestations#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sarcoid: Muscle, bone, and vascular disease manifestations&quot;, section on 'Focal bone lesions'</a>.)</p><p>Ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies reveal that ankle swelling in most patients with Lofgren&rsquo;s syndrome represents periarticular inflammation (soft tissue and tenosynovitis) rather than true joint swelling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-arthropathy/abstract/31,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,35</a>]. MRI can demonstrate tenosynovitis, tendonitis, bursitis, and joint <span class=\"nowrap\">effusion/synovitis</span> but is nonspecific and cannot differentiate sarcoid arthritis from other forms of arthropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-arthropathy/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>On gallium-67 scanning, the radioisotope is concentrated within the joints with varying intensity in patients with sarcoidosis and arthritis. However, the uptake of this radioisotope does not appear to correlate with the acuity or chronicity of the joint disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3597427548\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of sarcoid arthropathy is based upon suggestive clinical, imaging, and synovial fluid findings, and in selected cases on synovial tissue biopsy. The diagnosis of sarcoidosis usually requires biopsy of the involved organ, with a major exception, which is in patients with classic Lofgren's syndrome, where the diagnosis can be made based upon clinical features alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-arthropathy/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>Thus, the diagnosis of acute sarcoid arthritis can be made in a patient under the age of 40 with suspected Lofgren's syndrome or acute bilateral ankle arthritis or periarthritis based upon the combination of the bilateral acute ankle changes and hilar adenopathy, with or without the tender red nodules of erythema nodosum; such findings have a high degree of specificity for the diagnosis of acute sarcoid arthritis. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Acute arthritis and Lofgren's syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p>In patients with a negative chest radiograph, a computed tomography (CT) scan of the chest may be helpful to identify hilar lymphadenopathy. The finding of sterile noncaseating granulomatous inflammation on synovial biopsy is supportive but is not pathognomonic of sarcoidosis. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Synovial biopsy'</a> below.)</p><p>A diagnosis of chronic sarcoid arthritis can be made in a patient with sarcoidosis and one of the characteristic manifestations of chronic sarcoid arthropathy (eg, nondeforming arthritis with granulomatous synovitis, Jaccoud's type deformity of the hands, joint swelling adjacent to a sarcoid bone lesion, or dactylitis), after exclusion of other conditions with similar musculoskeletal features (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Chronic arthritis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below). Rarely, patients may present with clinical features of chronic sarcoid arthritis before the diagnosis of sarcoidosis is established.</p><p>The utility of laboratory testing and of other diagnostic procedures in patients suspected of having sarcoidosis is discussed in more detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonary-sarcoidosis#H37\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of pulmonary sarcoidosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic approach'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Synovial biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A paucity of data exists concerning the characteristics of synovial tissue in acute or chronic sarcoid arthritis. Synovial cysts with typical noncaseating granulomas have been observed on arthroscopically obtained synovial biopsies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-arthropathy/abstract/32,38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,38,39</a>]; however, closed synovial membrane needle biopsies are not helpful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-arthropathy/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The increasing use of needle arthroscopes which permit the performance of a synovial biopsy under direct vision may eventually provide additional useful information.</p><p>When indicated for diagnostic purposes, several samples of synovial tissue obtained by arthroscopically directed biopsy may be submitted for the following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fresh (unfixed) tissue for microbiologic studies, including mycobacterial and fungal stains and cultures</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absolute alcohol fixed tissue for processing with water-free stains (eg, Wright-Giemsa) and examination under polarizing microscopy to exclude urate or calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPPD) tophi</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Formalin fixed tissue for routine light microscopy</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of sarcoid arthropathy includes several rheumatic diseases, including reactive arthritis, crystal-induced disorders, and rheumatoid arthritis; and infectious mimics of pulmonary sarcoidosis that sometimes have associated joint manifestations, particularly those due to <em>Mycobacterium</em> tuberculosis (TB) and <em>Histoplasma</em> capsulatum. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonary-sarcoidosis#H37\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of pulmonary sarcoidosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic approach'</a>.)</p><p>In the presence of typical pulmonary or other nonpulmonary features of sarcoidosis, a synovial biopsy that reveals multiple noncaseating granulomas offers additional support for the diagnosis of sarcoidosis. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Synovial biopsy'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Reactive arthritis</strong> &ndash; Reactive arthritis is a type of seronegative spondyloarthritis that commonly leads to inflammation of the spine and oligoarthritis involving lower-extremity joints, especially the ankles. Involvement of spine and asymmetrical lower-extremity joint involvement, as well as joint swelling rather than periarthritis can help to differentiate it from sarcoid arthropathy. The absence of hilar lymphadenopathy on chest radiograph also helps to differentiate it from Lofgren&rsquo;s syndrome. Reactive arthritis, unlike sarcoid, occurs soon following one of a set of infectious illnesses that causes enteritis or urethritis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reactive-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reactive arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Tuberculous arthritis and Poncet&rsquo;s disease</strong> &ndash; Mono- or oligoarthritis of lower-extremity joints, especially knees, is seen in patients with pulmonary TB. Tuberculous joint infection is typically monoarticular, while inflammatory arthritis associated with TB, known as Poncet disease, in which the organism typically cannot be identified in the joint, is commonly an acute, symmetrical polyarthritis of large and small joints. Diagnosis of pulmonary TB with symptoms of productive cough, evidence of TB on chest radiograph, weight loss, a high erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and confirmation by the identification of the organisms on histopathology or culture can help to distinguish the two conditions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=skeletal-tuberculosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Skeletal tuberculosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Histoplasmosis</strong> &ndash; Histoplasmosis is usually seen in immunocompromised hosts and regions where histoplasmosis is endemic. It typically presents with pneumonia with mediastinal or hilar lymphadenopathy, pulmonary nodules, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cavitary lesions. It can cause arthritis or arthralgia as well as erythema nodosum, which can closely mimic sarcoid arthritis. Diagnosis of histoplasmosis can be made by detection of <em>Histoplasma</em> antigen by enzyme immunoassay in the urine, blood, or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and clinical features of pulmonary histoplasmosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pulmonary-histoplasmosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and treatment of pulmonary histoplasmosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Crystal-induced arthritis </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Gout and pseudogout (acute calcium pyrophosphate deposition arthritis) can cause acute monoarthritis and occasional oligoarthritis of the great toes <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ankles, including podagra which may look similar to sarcoid arthropathy. The key clinical differentiation from sarcoid is that gout and pseudogout are typically intensely inflammatory (with severe redness, tenderness and swelling) and they resolve within a few days to a week with conservative treatment. Confirmation of these diagnoses is by the demonstration of characteristic crystals in the synovial fluid using polarizing light microscopy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gout\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of gout&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition (CPPD) disease&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Rheumatoid arthritis</strong> &ndash; Rheumatoid arthritis can involve joints of the lower extremity, including the ankles, knees, and metatarsophalangeal joints; however, it can be differentiated from sarcoid arthropathy by characteristic history and examination findings, including the typical hand involvement seen in rheumatoid arthritis and positive testing for rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies.

Infliximab has been found effective for sarcoid arthropathy, as described in case reports, and benefit was suggested in one randomized trial which evaluated extrapulmonary manifestation as a secondary outcome, although the number of patients with resolution of bone and joint involvement in the treatment group did not achieve statistical significance compared with the placebo group at week 24 (8 of 19 versus 0 of 8) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sarcoid-arthropathy/abstract/47-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-49</a>].

Acute arthritis often involves the joints of the lower extremities, is mostly accompanied by hilar adenopathy and erythema nodosum (Lofgren's syndrome), and usually resolves spontaneously, although it may persist in one-third of affected patients. Chronic arthritis, which is less common than the acute form, is frequently associated with parenchymal lung disease and other extrapulmonary manifestations like cutaneous disease. (See <a href=\"#H3085326157\" class=\"local\">'Frequency of musculoskeletal sarcoid'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Acute arthritis and Lofgren's syndrome'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Chronic arthritis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnosis of sarcoid arthritis is based upon the presence of compatible clinical features, imaging findings, and a negative skin test for tuberculosis. The diagnosis of sarcoid arthritis can be made without a tissue biopsy in most patients with classic Lofgren's syndrome, where the diagnosis can be made based upon clinical features alone unless there is a strong suspicion of an infectious etiology. An inflammatory but sterile joint aspirate further supports the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H3597427548\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic approach'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3175740723\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Synovial biopsy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A diagnosis of chronic sarcoid arthritis can be made in a patient with sarcoidosis and one of the characteristic manifestations of chronic sarcoid arthropathy (eg, nondeforming arthritis with granulomatous synovitis, Jaccoud's type deformity of the hands, joint swelling adjacent to a sarcoid bone lesion, or dactylitis) after exclusion of other conditions with similar musculoskeletal features. (See <a href=\"#H3597427548\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic approach'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3175740723\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Synovial biopsy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of sarcoid arthropathy includes several rheumatic diseases, including reactive arthritis, crystal-induced disorders, and rheumatoid arthritis; and infectious mimics of pulmonary sarcoidosis that sometimes have associated joint manifestations, particularly those due to <em>Mycobacterium</em> tuberculosis (TB) and <em>Histoplasma</em> capsulatum. Synovial biopsy is sometimes necessary, principally to exclude other causes of arthritis, particularly infectious diseases such as TB and histoplasmosis.
