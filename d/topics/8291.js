They can happen because of an allergy or other causes. In most cases, hives come and go within a few hours. But they can show up again and again in some people. </p><p>Some people who get hives also get a condition called &quot;angioedema.&quot; Angioedema is puffiness or swelling. It usually happens in the face, eyelids, ears, mouth, hands, feet, or genitals. </p><p>Some people who get hives or angioedema are having a dangerous allergic reaction. <strong>See a doctor or nurse right away</strong> if you suddenly get hives or get puffy and also have any of these symptoms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tightness in the throat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea and vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cramps or stomach pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Passing out</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H478574274\"><span class=\"h1\">Why did I get hives?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you just got hives for the first time, you might have a new allergy to something. People can get hives because of allergies to: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines, such as antibiotics or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Foods, such as eggs, nuts, fish, or shellfish</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Something they touched, such as a plant, animal saliva, or latex</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insect stings</p><p/><p>If your hives are caused by an allergy, you will need to avoid whatever you are allergic to.</p><p>Hives can also be caused by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infections</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having cold air or water on the skin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having something press or vibrate against the skin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Changes in body temperature (such as when you cool down after a hot shower or a work out)</p><p/><p>If you have had hives on most days for more than 6 weeks, you probably do not have an allergy. Hives that last this long are called &quot;chronic hives.&quot; In most cases, doctors do not know what causes chronic hives. </p><p>If you have chronic hives, you will probably need to take medicines every day to control them. Luckily, chronic hives do usually go away with time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H478574281\"><span class=\"h1\">How are hives treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You might not need treatment. Hives usually go away in a few days or weeks, even if you do not get treated. If you have hives for the first time, talk to your doctor or nurse about whether or not you need treatment. If you do, the first step will be to figure out if anything triggered the hives. If so, you will need to avoid that trigger. </p><p>To relieve itching, you can take medicines called antihistamines. These are the same medicines people usually take for allergies. </p><p>If you have severe hives or your hives will not go away, your doctor or nurse might suggest that you take medicines called steroids for a short time. Steroids work well but you should not take them for long, because they can cause serious side effects. These are <strong>not</strong> the same as the steroids some athletes take illegally. These steroids relieve itching and reduce swelling.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H478574288\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Anaphylaxis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-hives-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chronic hives (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-hives-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Physical hives (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hives-urticaria-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Hives (urticaria) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
