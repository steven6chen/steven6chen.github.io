Increased sexual interest and noncoital sexual behaviors are characteristic of middle adolescence. The average age of first coitus is approximately 16 years among American adolescents, but the age is lower in certain populations, such as inner city youth.</p><p>Late adolescence ends with the transition into young adulthood and is associated with high levels of sexual activity and acquisition of STIs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>STIs are common in adolescents. <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/std/stats16/toc.htm&amp;token=R4Uiw8/bmPVaqNHRDqpXLKc40yA2l/eOq6BlGZbgwy0XJc6A5r2eJEMz/4Zzer6P&amp;TOPIC_ID=115\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Surveillance in the United States</a> suggests that approximately 50 percent of all new STIs occur in adolescents and young adults (age 15 to 24 years) and that approximately 25 percent of sexually active adolescent females have had an STI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexually-transmitted-infections-issues-specific-to-adolescents/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Rates of genital gonorrhea increased among adolescent females (age 15 to 19 years) between 2015 and 2016 (from 442 to 482 cases per 100,000 population) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexually-transmitted-infections-issues-specific-to-adolescents/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. During the same time period, rates of genital chlamydia increased among female adolescents (from 2987 to 3071 cases per 100,000), and rates of primary and secondary syphilis increased among male and female adolescents (from 8.0 to 8.9 and 2.7 to 3.3 cases per 100,000 population, respectively).</p><p>Repeated acquisition of STIs is common: As many as 40 percent of the annual incidence of chlamydial or gonococcal disease occurs in adolescents previously infected with the causative organisms, and this proportion may be increasing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexually-transmitted-infections-issues-specific-to-adolescents/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Reinfection'</a> below.)</p><p>Repeated acquisition of STIs is a risk factor for subsequent development of HIV infection. In a retrospective cohort of 75,273 high school students who participated in an STI screening program between 2003 and 2010, 248 students (0.3 percent) tested positive for HIV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexually-transmitted-infections-issues-specific-to-adolescents/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The risk of HIV infection was at least three times higher in students with multiple gonococcal infections than students with no history of gonorrhea (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 3.5, 95% CI 1.9-6.4 for girls and IRR 5.1, 95% CI 3.6-7.1 for boys). Among HIV-positive students, there was at least one year between the first STI and positive HIV test for 86 percent of girls and 96 percent of boys, suggesting a window of opportunity for preventive interventions.</p><p>Among adolescents, HIV infection is primarily transmitted sexually, although it may be transmitted by other routes (eg, injection drug use, blood products).

One such factor is cervical ectopy or cervical immaturity, which refers to the area of ectocervix that is covered by columnar epithelium after puberty. Columnar epithelium is thought to be more susceptible than is squamous epithelium (that replaces columnar upon maturation) to sexually transmitted organisms such as <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em>, <em>C. trachomatis</em>, and HPV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexually-transmitted-infections-issues-specific-to-adolescents/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, one study could not demonstrate an independent association of cervical ectopy with STIs among adolescent women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexually-transmitted-infections-issues-specific-to-adolescents/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Secretory immunoglobulin A (sIgA), a local protective antibody, is another postulated biologic factor. Adolescents had slightly lower levels of sIgA in cervical mucus than did adult women in one small study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexually-transmitted-infections-issues-specific-to-adolescents/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Another study addressing whether sIgA levels were higher in the secretory phase of the menstrual cycle (a phase that frequently is absent in early adolescence, when ovulation may not occur or may occur irregularly) found no difference in levels in different phases of the adolescent menstrual cycle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexually-transmitted-infections-issues-specific-to-adolescents/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Vaginal microbiota play an important role in vaginal immune and inflammatory responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sexually-transmitted-infections-issues-specific-to-adolescents/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

Approximately 50 percent of all new STIs occur in adolescents and young adults (age 15 to 24 years) and approximately 25 percent of sexually active adolescent females have had an STI. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although the evaluation and treatment of STIs in adolescents are similar to the diagnosis and treatment of STIs in adults, a number of specific concerns are particular to adolescents (eg, consent and confidentiality, mandatory reporting of sexual activity <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> STI, dating violence, and challenges to optimal treatment and prevention). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Specific concerns in adolescents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Routine assessment of sexual activity is an essential element of STI-related care for adolescents. The sexual history (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F61677\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61677 \">table 1</a>) should be straightforward and nonjudgmental. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Sexual history'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pattern of presenting symptoms and signs of STIs can guide the need for additional information from the history, examination, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> laboratory. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'STI clinical patterns'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>STIs associated with urethral or vaginal discharge include gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomonas, bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, <em>Mycoplasma genitalium</em>, and occasionally herpes simplex virus (HSV). (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Discharge syndromes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>STIs associated with genital ulcers in adolescents generally include HSV and primary syphilis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F75291\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75291 \">picture 2A</a>). However, patients with ulcerative STI are at risk for coinfection, so most adolescents with genital ulcers should be tested for syphilis, HSV, HIV, gonorrhea, and chlamydia. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Genital ulcer syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pelvic inflammatory disease refers to acute infection of the upper genital tract structures (eg, uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries). It should be suspected in sexually active adolescents who present with pelvic discomfort, although infection can be subclinical. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Pelvic inflammatory disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>STIs associated with skin lesions include genital warts caused by human papillomavirus (HPV), primary syphilis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F75291%7EID%2F57637%7EOBGYN%2F73119\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75291 graphicRef57637 graphicRef73119 \">picture 2A-C</a>), secondary syphilis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F68877\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68877 \">picture 4</a>), disseminated gonococcal infection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F71303\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71303 \">picture 5</a>), pediculosis pubis, and scabies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F114534%7EDERM%2F75169\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef114534 graphicRef75169 \">picture 7A-B</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>STIs associated with oral lesions include syphilis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F63924%7EDERM%2F52729\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63924 graphicRef52729 \">picture 8A-B</a>), gonorrhea, HPV, and HSV.
