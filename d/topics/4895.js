A contemporary definition for cardiomyopathy is a myocardial disorder in which the heart muscle is structurally and functionally abnormal in the absence of coronary artery disease, hypertension, valvular disease, and congenital heart disease sufficient to explain the observed myocardial abnormality. Cardiomyopathies include a variety of myocardial disorders that manifest with various structural and functional phenotypes and are frequently genetic. Although some have defined cardiomyopathy to include myocardial disease caused by known cardiovascular causes (such as hypertension, ischemic heart disease, or valvular disease), current major society definitions of cardiomyopathy exclude heart disease secondary to such cardiovascular disorders. </p><p>Definitions and classification systems for cardiomyopathies are described here. The individual disorders and the evaluation of the patient with heart failure or cardiomyopathy are discussed separately.

In clinical practice, however, the term &quot;cardiomyopathy&quot; has also been applied to diseases of known cardiovascular cause (eg, &quot;ischemic cardiomyopathy&quot; and &quot;hypertensive cardiomyopathy&quot;).</p><p>As a result, the 1995 <span class=\"nowrap\">WHO/International</span> Society and Federation of Cardiology (ISFC) Task Force on the Definition and Classification of the Cardiomyopathies expanded the classification to include all diseases affecting heart muscle and to take into consideration etiology as well as the dominant pathophysiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-classification-of-the-cardiomyopathies/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In this 1995 classification, the cardiomyopathies were defined as &quot;diseases of the myocardium associated with cardiac dysfunction.&quot; They were classified according to anatomy and physiology into the following types, each of which has multiple different causes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arrhythmogenic right ventricular <span class=\"nowrap\">cardiomyopathy/dysplasia</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">(ARVC/D)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unclassified cardiomyopathies</p><p/><p>Cardiomyopathies that are associated with specific cardiac or systemic disorders generally fall into one or more of the above morphologic types. These categories are included in subsequent American Heart <span class=\"nowrap\">Association/European</span> Society of Cardiology <span class=\"nowrap\">(AHA/ESC)</span> classification systems. Etiologies include a host of genetic, inflammatory, metabolic, toxic, and other diseases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F78298%7ECARD%2F52168\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78298 graphicRef52168 \">table 1A-B</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F60494\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60494 \">table 2</a>). The 1995 <span class=\"nowrap\">WHO/ISFC</span> classification system included ischemic, valvular, and hypertensive disease among the causes of cardiomyopathy. </p><p>A 2006 AHA scientific statement proposed a contemporary definition and classification of the cardiomyopathies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-classification-of-the-cardiomyopathies/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The expert consensus panel proposed the following definition: &quot;Cardiomyopathies are a heterogeneous group of diseases of the myocardium associated with mechanical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> electrical dysfunction that usually (but not invariably) exhibit inappropriate ventricular hypertrophy or dilation and are due to a variety of causes that frequently are genetic. Cardiomyopathies either are confined to the heart or are a part of generalized systemic disorders, often leading to cardiovascular death or progressive heart failure-related disability.&quot; Cardiomyopathies are categorized into two groups: primary cardiomyopathies (predominantly involving the heart) and secondary cardiomyopathies (accompanied by other organ system involvement). The primary cardiomyopathies are subdivided into those which are genetic, mixed (predominantly nongenetic; less commonly genetic), or acquired. The genetic cardiomyopathies include HCM, <span class=\"nowrap\">ARVC/D,</span> left ventricular noncompaction, PRKAG2 and Danon glycogen storage diseases, conduction defects, mitochondrial myopathies, and ion channel disorders. The mixed cardiomyopathies include DCM and RCM. The acquired cardiomyopathies include myocarditis, stress-induced (takotsubo), peripartum, tachycardia-induced, and infants of insulin-dependent diabetic mothers. </p><p>The AHA definition and classification are not intended to provide methodologies for clinical diagnosis, but are rather a scientific scheme that aims to aid in the understanding of this complex group of disorders. The main departure of the proposed AHA Scientific Statement definition from previous classifications is the inclusion of the ion channelopathies as primary cardiomyopathies, despite the absence of gross structural abnormalities. </p><p>Genes contributing to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy are more frequently identified than are genes in patients with a dilated or restrictive cardiomyopathy. However, data suggest a small fraction of cardiomyopathies classified as acquired in the AHA schema including myocarditis have genetic contributions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-classification-of-the-cardiomyopathies/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>In 2008, the ESC working group on myocardial and pericardial diseases presented an update to the <span class=\"nowrap\">WHO/ISFC</span> classification in which cardiomyopathy was defined as: &quot;A myocardial disorder in which the heart muscle is structurally and functionally abnormal in the absence of coronary artery disease, hypertension, valvular disease and congenital heart disease sufficient to explain the observed myocardial abnormality&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F64479%7ECARD%2F74268\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64479 graphicRef74268 \">table 3A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-classification-of-the-cardiomyopathies/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The ESC classification is meant to be particularly useful in everyday clinical practice.</p><p>The AHA and ESC classification systems differ from the earlier <span class=\"nowrap\">WHO/ISFC</span> classification in emphasizing the distinction between <span class=\"nowrap\">familial/genetic</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">nonfamilial/non-genetic</span> causes of cardiomyopathy and excluding heart disease secondary to coronary artery disease, valvular, or congenital heart disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F64479%7ECARD%2F74268\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64479 graphicRef74268 \">table 3A-B</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-classification-of-the-cardiomyopathies/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The ESC classification differs from the AHA classification in also excluding ion channelopathies. </p><p>The MOGE(S) classification for a phenotype-genotype-based nomenclature of cardiomyopathy was endorsed by the World Heart Federation and published in 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-classification-of-the-cardiomyopathies/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. This proposed system was inspired by the TNM staging of malignant tumors and does not include ion channelopathies. The clinical applicability of this system has not yet been defined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-classification-of-the-cardiomyopathies/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. This system involves notation of five attributes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The morphofunctional (M) notation indicates a descriptive phenotypic diagnosis (eg, M<sub>D</sub> = dilated cardiomyopathy).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The organ involvement (O) notation indicates if heart <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> extracardiac involvement related to the cause of heart disease is present (eg, O<sub>H+K </sub>= heart and kidney involvement).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The genetic or familial inheritance (G) notation indicates the nature of genetic transmission (eg, G<sub>AD</sub> = autosomal dominant).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The etiological annotation (E) provides description of the specific cause (eg, the specific gene and mutation as in E<sub>G-MYH7[p.Arg403Glu]</sub>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The addition of a functional status (S) term is considered optional (eg, S<sub>C-II </sub>= stage C disease in New York Heart Association [NYHA] functional class II).</p><p/><p>A study using a MOGE(S) scoring system ranging from 0 to 4 (assigning one point for each attribute, ie, extracardiac involvement, genetic etiology, environmental etiology, NYHA functional class &ge;III) found that a MOGE(S) score&nbsp;&ge;2 was associated with worse outcomes in patients with DCM,&nbsp;supporting this classification for predicting risk of cardiovascular events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-classification-of-the-cardiomyopathies/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>In summary, cardiomyopathies were originally defined as disorders that were idiopathic. Nevertheless, in clinical practice, the terms &quot;ischemic,&quot; &quot;valvular,&quot; and &quot;hypertensive cardiomyopathy&quot; have been used commonly, particularly in North America. The 1995 <span class=\"nowrap\">WHO/ISFC</span> Task Force used the term &quot;specific cardiomyopathy&quot; to reflect this reality and the fact that the genetic basis of the cardiomyopathies was being elucidated. The 2008 ESC proposal provides a clinical approach to diagnosing a patient who presents with symptoms, a family history of cardiomyopathy, or electrocardiographic and echocardiographic abnormalities that are otherwise unexplained. Like the 2006 AHA proposal, it focuses on the established morphological types described by the 1995 <span class=\"nowrap\">WHO/ISFC</span> Task Force (HCM, DCM, ARVC, RCM). The AHA, ESC, and MOGE(S) classification systems then go on to define the familial and, if possible, genetic basis of disease. </p><p>The use of the term &quot;cardiomyopathy&quot; to describe valvular, ischemic, or hypertensive heart disease unnecessarily broadens a term best suited to predominantly reflect genetically determined diseases with recognizable phenotypes. However, the term &quot;ischemic cardiomyopathy&quot; continues to be used by some, including the 2013 American College of Cardiology <span class=\"nowrap\">Foundation/American</span> Heart Association heart failure guidelines, the 2010 Heart Failure Society of America guidelines, and the 2008 Canadian Cardiovascular Society guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-classification-of-the-cardiomyopathies/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ECHOCARDIOGRAPHIC EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Identification of various cardiomyopathy phenotypes relies primarily upon echocardiographic evaluation. Two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography can, in most cases, define the anatomic and functional characteristics of the heart that are diagnostic of dilated, hypertrophic, arrhythmogenic right ventricular, or restrictive cardiomyopathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=echocardiographic-recognition-of-cardiomyopathies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Echocardiographic recognition of cardiomyopathies&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In select cases, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging or computed tomography may be useful to identify and localize fat, iron, or amyloid infiltration, inflammation, <span class=\"nowrap\">scar/fibrosis,</span> focal hypertrophy, left ventricular (LV) apical aneurysm, and right ventricular structure and function. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-utility-of-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance-imaging#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical utility of cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging&quot;, section on 'Cardiomyopathy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-morphologic-variants-and-the-pathophysiology-of-left-ventricular-outflow-tract-obstruction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Morphologic variants and the pathophysiology of left ventricular outflow tract obstruction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Systolic dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systolic dysfunction is characterized by a decrease in myocardial contractility. When myocardial contractility is decreased globally (ie, throughout the LV), a reduction in the LV ejection fraction (LVEF) results. While a variety of approaches are available for the quantitative measurement of LV systolic function, the LVEF is often assessed qualitatively. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tests-to-evaluate-left-ventricular-systolic-function\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tests to evaluate left ventricular systolic function&quot;</a>.)</p><p>When systolic dysfunction occurs, cardiac output is initially maintained in two ways:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LV enlargement, which results in a higher stroke volume</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Frank-Starling relationship (an increase in contractility in response to increasing stretch)</p><p/><p>However, these compensatory mechanisms are eventually exceeded and cardiac output decreases, resulting in the physiologic manifestations of heart failure (HF). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-left-ventricular-pressure-volume-and-other-hemodynamic-relationships\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of heart failure: Left ventricular pressure-volume and other hemodynamic relationships&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Systolic dysfunction is characteristic of dilated cardiomyopathy. It is also seen in some patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) who develop progressive LV wall thinning, a small increase in diastolic dimension, and a decrease in LVEF. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-natural-history-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy: Natural history and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Diastolic dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diastolic dysfunction refers to cardiac dysfunction in which LV relaxation and filling is abnormal and is accompanied by elevated filling pressures. Diastolic dysfunction may occur with or without associated systolic dysfunction. In patients presenting with HF but without systolic dysfunction, diastolic dysfunction is the presumed cause. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The LV diastole includes two components (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F61186\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61186 \">figure 1</a>). LV relaxation is a dynamic process that takes place during isovolumic relaxation (the period between aortic valve closure and mitral valve opening) and then during early rapid filling of the ventricle. Later in diastole, after relaxation is complete, further LV filling is a passive process that is dependent on the compliance or distensibility of the myocardium and ends in the atrial filling phase. Either active relaxation or passive compliance or both may be impaired in a patient with diastolic dysfunction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Diastolic dysfunction is more difficult to identify and quantitate echocardiographically than systolic dysfunction, and may be missed or underestimated in many cases. Echocardiographic evaluation of LV diastolic dysfunction includes Doppler assessment of transmitral flow and pulmonary venous flow as well as tissue Doppler imaging. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=echocardiographic-evaluation-of-left-ventricular-diastolic-function\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Echocardiographic evaluation of left ventricular diastolic function&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Diastolic dysfunction is characteristic of both HCM and restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM). However, some component of diastolic dysfunction is also common in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM).</p><p>The syndrome of HF with normal or near normal LV systolic function has been termed &quot;HF with preserved ejection fraction&quot; (HF-PEF) or &quot;HF with normal ejection fraction&quot; (HF-NEF). However, this category (HF-NEF or HF-PEF) encompasses a mixed group of clinical syndromes that included HF-PEF as well as other conditions such as valvular heart disease, pericardial disease, and right HF. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction#H1\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction&quot;, section on 'Introduction'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMIC AND PHYSIOLOGIC CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cardiomyopathies are classified into the following categories based upon morphology and physiology.</p><p><br/>Some cardiac disorders may present as more than one type of cardiomyopathy or may cross classification categories as they progress, as illustrated by the following examples: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Amyloid cardiomyopathy, which may present as a hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or as a restrictive cardiomyopathy.

The dilation often becomes severe and is invariably accompanied by an increase in total cardiac mass (hypertrophy) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F59773\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef59773 \">image 1</a>). Affected patients have impaired systolic function and clinical presentation is usually with features of heart failure (HF). When the presenting manifestations include conduction abnormalities, atrial <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ventricular arrhythmias, and sudden death, then an arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy caused by mutations in desmosomal, ion channel, and the lamin gene should be considered.</p><p>The incidence of DCM has been estimated to be five to eight cases per 100,000 population, with a prevalence of 36 per 100,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-classification-of-the-cardiomyopathies/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. These figures may underestimate the frequency of the disorder because so many patients with DCM have incomplete disease expression, which goes unrecognized. It has been suggested that up to 14 percent of the middle-aged and elderly population have asymptomatic left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-classification-of-the-cardiomyopathies/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>The complete list of causes of DCM is extensive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-classification-of-the-cardiomyopathies/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The common causes include viruses and gene mutations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F80595\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80595 \">table 4</a>), which are now recognized to be relatively common among patients with idiopathic DCM. In addition, the later stages of hypertrophic heart disease may resemble DCM (such as genetic hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [HCM]).

In addition to these changes in the LV, other findings include left atrial enlargement and, less often, right ventricular enlargement and dysfunction. In such patients, all four chambers may be dilated.

The term &quot;HCM&quot; is also used in a broader sense in the 2006 AHA and 2008 ESC classification system to include a variety of conditions with increased ventricular wall thickness or mass not caused by pathologic loading conditions (eg, hypertension or valve disease) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F64479\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64479 \">table 3A</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F74268\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74268 \">table 3B</a>).
