Of the 6006 fetal karyotypes obtained at one center, 151 of the 207 abnormalities (73 percent) were aneuploidies (trisomy, triploidy, monosomy), and about 90 percent of these involved chromosomes 21, 18, 13, X, or Y <span class=\"nowrap\">(135/207</span> or 65 percent of all karyotypic abnormalities) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sonographic-findings-associated-with-fetal-aneuploidy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Fetal chromosomal abnormalities are more common in the first and second trimesters than in live born infants, due to the high rate of spontaneous loss of these fetuses over the course of pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sonographic-findings-associated-with-fetal-aneuploidy/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Termination of affected pregnancies also plays a role.</p><p>The antepartum detection of fetal aneuploidy is one of the major goals of prenatal screening programs. Sonographic examination is useful because fetuses with abnormal karyotypes often have anatomic changes or anomalies. Sonographic findings, results of maternal cell-free DNA or biochemical marker screening, and parental risk factors for genetic disease are all considered in determining the risk that the fetus is affected. However, invasive testing (amniocentesis or chorionic villus biopsy) is required to obtain a definitive karyotypic diagnosis.</p><p>Sonographic findings associated with fetal aneuploidy will be discussed here. Detailed discussions of first and second trimester maternal screening for Down syndrome and trisomy 18, with and without sonography, are reviewed separately.

They are often associated with normal fetuses (ie, normal variants), usually have no clinical sequelae, and are transient, resolving with advancing gestation or after birth. They do carry an increased risk for fetal aneuploidy, however, and correlation with the patient's biochemical risk status should be done.

The prevalence is higher in aneuploid fetuses and the likelihood of aneuploidy is significantly increased when more than one marker is present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sonographic-findings-associated-with-fetal-aneuploidy/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. Even in this setting, use of soft markers for screening for, or excluding, fetal aneuploidy is inefficient; however, a detailed evaluation of fetal anatomy should be performed whenever one or more soft markers has been identified.</p><p>Screening for soft markers is not a component of a basic obstetrical ultrasound examination (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ultrasound-examination-in-obstetrics-and-gynecology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ultrasound examination in obstetrics and gynecology&quot;</a>). Detection and reporting of soft markers (ie, echogenic intracardiac focus and choroid plexus cysts) is controversial because this information is anxiety-provoking for patients, requires considerable time for counseling, and may lead to invasive prenatal testing. Such testing may result in procedure-related loss of a normal fetus, and is costly.</p><p>Fetal soft markers of aneuploidy&nbsp;on second trimester ultrasound examination, including recommendations for follow-up, are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F95030\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95030 \">table 1</a>). In addition, the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine provides the following guidance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sonographic-findings-associated-with-fetal-aneuploidy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women who undergo cell-free DNA screening, ultrasound solely to assess nuchal translucency at 11 to 14 weeks is not recommended.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An isolated soft marker is not considered a marker for aneuploidy if the cell-free DNA screen or first- or second-trimester biochemical screen is negative.

Determination of fetal nuchal translucency between 10 and 14 weeks of gestation combined with maternal analyte testing is an excellent screening test for detecting trisomy 21. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=first-trimester-combined-test-and-integrated-tests-for-screening-for-down-syndrome-and-trisomy-18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;First-trimester combined test and integrated tests for screening for Down syndrome and trisomy 18&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Nuchal translucency is the translucent nuchal space at the posterior fetal neck observed sonographically in the midsagittal plane (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F62637\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef62637 \">image 1</a>). An increase in the nuchal translucency measurement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F116279\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef116279 \">image 2</a>) is associated with an increased risk of fetal aneuploidy, structural anomalies, genetic syndromes, and adverse outcome. The risk increases as nuchal translucency increases. A detailed discussion can be found separately.

It results from a localized area of lymphatic dysplasia with dilatation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> leakage of lymph from the lymphatic vessels. It may be accompanied by generalized lymphedema. A small, unilocular cystic hygroma without accompanying diffuse lymphedema may be difficult to distinguish from other causes of nuchal thickening. By comparison, septations are characteristic of multilocular cystic hygromas and readily differentiate cystic hygromas from simple increased nuchal translucency (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F53158%7EOBGYN%2F64913\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef53158 graphicRef64913 \">image 3A-B</a>).</p><p>First trimester cystic hygromas are often associated with trisomies, whereas second trimester cystic hygromas are often associated with monosomy X.

The nuchal fold is the measurement between the outer edge of the occipital bone to the outer margin of the skin and is taken in the axial plane. An increase in this measurement is also associated with aneuploidy. An increased nuchal fold is detected in 20 to 33 percent of fetuses with Down syndrome and 0.5 to 2 percent of euploid fetuses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sonographic-findings-associated-with-fetal-aneuploidy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

Based on this observation, absence of visualization of the fetal nasal bone ossification has been investigated as a possible fetal marker of Down syndrome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F59173%7EOBGYN%2F51069\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef59173 graphicRef51069 \">image 4A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sonographic-findings-associated-with-fetal-aneuploidy/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>].</p><p>When the fetal profile is viewed in the midsagittal plane, the nasal bone synostosis appears as a thin echogenic line within the bridge of the nose. The nasal bone is considered present if this line is more echogenic than the overlying skin, and absent if it is not visualized, or less echogenic, than the overlying skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sonographic-findings-associated-with-fetal-aneuploidy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The optimum time for nasal bone assessment is at crown rump length of 65 to 74 mm (13 to 13.5 weeks of gestation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sonographic-findings-associated-with-fetal-aneuploidy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Absent nasal bone ossification earlier in gestation could reflect delayed maturation in a euploid fetus, rather than actual absence of the structure.</p><p>The utility of this marker varies among studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A review of over 35,000 nasal bone examinations from nine studies including women at varying risk of Down syndrome noted successful examination was possible in 94.3 percent (range 76 to 100 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sonographic-findings-associated-with-fetal-aneuploidy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. An absent nasal bone was noted in 65 percent (range 0 to 80 percent) of fetuses with trisomy 21, but only 0.8 percent (range 0.3 to 2.5 percent) of chromosomally normal fetuses.</p><p/><p>A number of factors could explain the wide range of results. The training and experience of the examiner are critical and varied among studies. Performance of 40 to 120 supervised scans is needed to achieve competence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sonographic-findings-associated-with-fetal-aneuploidy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. There may have been greater attention to imaging the nasal bone in studies involving high risk patients, as some study populations were unselected while others were at high risk of Down syndrome. Some aneuploid fetuses could have been missed since pregnancy outcome was incompletely ascertained in most studies. In addition, the likelihood of trisomy 21 when the nasal bone is absent is affected by several factors. As an example, the likelihood ratio for trisomy 21 when the nasal bone is absent is considerably higher in Caucasians than in women of Afro-Caribbean origin (LR for trisomy 21: 31 versus 9), at 13 versus 11 weeks of gestation (LR for trisomy 21: 52 versus 18), and at NT 3.5-4.4 mm versus NT &ge;5.5 mm (LR for trisomy 21: 13 versus 5) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sonographic-findings-associated-with-fetal-aneuploidy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Combining multiple markers improves the detection of Down syndrome. This was illustrated in a study that screened over 20,000 women at 11 to 13 and <span class=\"nowrap\">6/7ths</span> weeks of gestation using maternal serum analytes, fetal nuchal translucency, and <span class=\"nowrap\">presence/absence</span> of nasal bone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sonographic-findings-associated-with-fetal-aneuploidy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Combined testing resulted in detection of 90 percent of fetuses with Down syndrome with a false positive rate of 2.5 percent (the detection rate was 95 percent if the false positive rate was 5 percent). The investigators published formulas utilizing these variables to predict Down syndrome risk.</p><p>In summary, nonvisualization of the nasal bone ossification at around 13 weeks of gestation is a proven finding in fetuses with Down syndrome. However, accurate prenatal assessment is technically difficult and requires on-going clinical practice. At this time, the role for fetal nasal bone imaging is unclear. In experienced hands, it may be a useful adjunct to screening, especially when other studies show a borderline or high risk of Down syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sonographic-findings-associated-with-fetal-aneuploidy/abstract/19,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,22</a>].</p><p>An absent nasal bone is less common in fetuses with trisomy 18 or 13 than in those with Down syndrome, but still more common with these aneuploidies than in euploid fetuses. In one review, the frequency of absent nasal bone in euploid, trisomy 13, trisomy 18, and trisomy 21 was 2.5, 45, 53, and 60 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sonographic-findings-associated-with-fetal-aneuploidy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Second trimester absent nasal bone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the second trimester, the reported sensitivity of absent nasal bone for Down syndrome varies widely, but is generally lower than in the first trimester [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sonographic-findings-associated-with-fetal-aneuploidy/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. The nasal bone is absent in about 30 to 40 percent of Down syndrome fetuses and 0.3 to 0.7 percent of euploid fetuses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sonographic-findings-associated-with-fetal-aneuploidy/abstract/11,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,26</a>]; it is hypoplastic in about 50 to 60 percent of Down syndrome fetuses and 6 to 7 percent of euploid fetuses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sonographic-findings-associated-with-fetal-aneuploidy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Using either nasal hypoplasia or absence as a marker increases sensitivity, but also the false positive rate. However, the detection rate depends upon the threshold used. Options include the ratio of biparietal diameter-nasal bone length <span class=\"nowrap\">(BPD/NB</span> thresholds of &gt;9 to &gt;12 have been used to define abnormal), a single pre-defined threshold for abnormal nasal bone length (&le;2.5 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sonographic-findings-associated-with-fetal-aneuploidy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]), a gestational age-based threshold (&lt;2.5th or 5th centile) based on the distribution of nasal bone length in normal fetuses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sonographic-findings-associated-with-fetal-aneuploidy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], or use of multiple of the median (MoM) of nasal bone length for gestational age (&lt;0.75 MoM) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sonographic-findings-associated-with-fetal-aneuploidy/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].

Sonographic examination is useful because fetuses with abnormal karyotypes often have anatomic changes or anomalies. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Soft markers are ultrasound findings that are usually associated with normal fetuses, have no clinical sequelae, and are transient. Isolated soft markers are identified in 11 to 17 percent of normal fetuses. The prevalence is higher in aneuploid fetuses and the likelihood of aneuploidy is significantly increased when more than one marker is present. However, even in this setting, use of soft markers for screening for or excluding fetal aneuploidy is inefficient. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Ultrasound markers'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fetal soft markers of aneuploidy&nbsp;on second trimester ultrasound examination, including recommendations for follow-up, are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F95030\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95030 \">table 1</a>). An isolated soft marker can be considered a normal variant in the setting of screen-negative results on cell-free DNA or first- or second-trimester biochemical aneuploidy screening. Although the risk of aneuploidy is not increased in this setting, some soft markers are clinically significant (eg, echogenic bowel may be associated with cystic fibrosis). (See <a href=\"#H1767577619\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most useful marker is increased nuchal translucency. Determination of fetal nuchal translucency between 10 and 14 weeks of gestation combined with maternal analyte testing is an excellent screening test for detecting trisomy 21. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'First trimester increased nuchal translucency'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fetuses with sonographic evidence of a structural anomaly are at increased risk of having a chromosomal abnormality. The magnitude of risk is highly dependent upon the specific malformation. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Structural anomalies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>First trimester cystic hygromas are often associated with trisomies, whereas second trimester cystic hygromas are often associated with monosomy X. (See <a href=\"#H2507942111\" class=\"local\">'Cystic hygroma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk of aneuploidy in growth restricted fetuses and fetuses with a single umbilical artery is substantially increased above baseline if a structural defect is identified on ultrasound examination. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Fetal growth restriction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Down syndrome risk estimates derived from different sonographic prediction tools (&quot;genetic sonogram&quot;) can be quite discordant, even if they use the same ultrasound markers. The use of cell-free DNA screening has replaced the genetic sonogram as a secondary screening test for women found to be at increased risk for Down syndrome on serum biochemical screening. Cell-free DNA screening is also offered to women with normal biochemical screening tests if ultrasound examination detects soft markers, thereby lowering the rate of false-negative biochemical screens and improving detection of affected fetuses.
