In the presence of severe underlying airflow obstruction, an exacerbation can cause respiratory failure and death.</p><p>The role of infection in exacerbations of COPD will be reviewed here. The management of infection in exacerbations of COPD is presented separately. Precipitants, risk factors, and other interventions (eg, bronchodilators, glucocorticoids, oxygen, and mechanical ventilation) are also discussed separately.

The remaining 20 to 30 percent are due to eosinophilic inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-for-infection-in-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], environmental pollution, or have an unknown etiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-for-infection-in-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Viral and bacterial infections cause most exacerbations, whereas atypical bacteria are a relatively uncommon cause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-for-infection-in-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3614765631\"><span class=\"h2\">Viruses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Viruses can be detected in one-third to two-thirds of exacerbations using culture, serology, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods. The most common viruses associated with exacerbations of COPD are rhinoviruses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-for-infection-in-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Influenza, parainfluenza, coronavirus, and adenovirus are also common during exacerbations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-for-infection-in-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/9-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-16</a>]. Respiratory syncytial virus and human metapneumovirus were more recently associated with exacerbations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-for-infection-in-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p>Identification of a virus in the sputum sample of a patient having a COPD exacerbation is relatively common and does not necessarily mean that this is the cause of the exacerbation. In fact, such viruses have been found in up to 15 percent of asymptomatic individuals with stable COPD using sensitive PCR-based assays [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-for-infection-in-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/9,11,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11,15,16</a>]. Influenza virus is an exception since asymptomatic colonization is unusual.</p><p>The mechanisms by which viruses induce exacerbations have been partially elucidated. Viral infection of the airway epithelial cells induces inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-for-infection-in-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. This causes airway epithelial damage, muscarinic receptor stimulation, and induction of inflammatory mediators (eg, cytokines, chemokines) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-for-infection-in-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Airway eosinophilia is sometimes associated with viral-mediated exacerbations, which highlights the importance of the host response to infection and its impact on both inflammation and symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-for-infection-in-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H854541689\"><span class=\"h2\">Bacteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bacterial infections appear to trigger one-third to one-half of COPD exacerbations. Nontypeable <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em>, <em>Moraxella catarrhalis</em>, and <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae </em>are the bacteria most frequently isolated bronchoscopically from patients having an exacerbation of COPD (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F70203\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70203 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-for-infection-in-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/21-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-27</a>]. <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </em>and Enterobacteriaceae are also commonly isolated, particularly from patients with severe COPD.</p><p>Exacerbations of COPD are strongly associated with acquisition of a new strain of <em>H. influenzae</em>, <em>M. catarrhalis</em>, <em>S. pneumoniae</em>, or <em>P. aeruginosa </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-for-infection-in-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/27-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-32</a>]. As a result, it has been proposed that acquisition of a new bacterial strain plays a central role in the pathogenesis of an exacerbation. This hypothesis is supported by the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exacerbations with new bacterial strains are more likely to be associated with a humoral immune response &ndash; In one study, exacerbations with a new strain of <em>H. influenzae </em>were significantly more likely to be associated with a humoral immune response than exacerbations with preexisting strains of <em>H. influenzae </em>(61 versus 21 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-for-infection-in-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. These new antibodies were strain specific. <em>M. catarrhalis</em>, <em>S. pneumoniae, </em>and <em>P. aeruginosa </em>also induce an antibody response that is measurable following an exacerbation of COPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-for-infection-in-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/31,34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,34-36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exacerbations with new bacterial strains are associated with a more robust inflammatory response &ndash; Exacerbations of COPD with a new strain of bacteria have been associated with more intense neutrophilic airway inflammation and systemic inflammation than exacerbations not associated with a change in preexisting bacterial strains or recovery of pathogenic bacteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-for-infection-in-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Resolution of the airway inflammation is related to eradication of pathogenic bacteria from sputum and resolution of clinical symptoms. In an animal model, new strains of <em>H. influenzae </em>that were known to be associated with COPD exacerbation caused significantly more airway neutrophil recruitment than colonizing strains of <em>H. influenzae </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-for-infection-in-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p/><p>Most of the human studies were performed in patients with COPD who had chronic bronchitis because expectorated sputum could be obtained easily. Thus, the degree to which the data can be generalized to exacerbations in patients with COPD who do not have chronic bronchitis is unknown. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease-definition-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: Definition, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging&quot;, section on 'Definitions'</a>.)</p><p>The idea that exacerbations of COPD are due to acquisition of a new strain of bacteria has largely replaced the older hypothesis that increases in the concentration of colonizing bacteria are the primary cause of exacerbations. The older theory was largely disproven by a comprehensive analysis of the relationship among sputum bacterial concentrations, exacerbation occurrence, and new pathogen acquisition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-for-infection-in-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The analysis demonstrated that an increase in bacterial load is not a cause of exacerbation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3015254386\"><span class=\"h2\">Atypical bacteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are conflicting data regarding the incidence of atypical bacterial infection in patients having an exacerbation of COPD. This is related, in large part, to the varying criteria used to diagnose exacerbation and infection. The incidence of <em>Chlamydia pneumoniae</em> in exacerbations of COPD was 3 to 5 percent in studies using rigorous methodology that excluded pneumonia and defined infection as a strict fourfold increase in titer or a positive culture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-for-infection-in-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/12,40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,40,41</a>]. However, based on more recent studies of patients with community-acquired pneumonia that used molecular techniques, the incidence is likely even lower (&lt;1 percent) except in the setting of epidemics (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumonia-caused-by-chlamydia-pneumoniae-in-adults#H1280373340\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pneumonia caused by Chlamydia pneumoniae in adults&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>). <em>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</em> and <em>Legionella </em>spp are also rare causes of COPD exacerbations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2044556288\"><span class=\"h2\">Coinfection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Coinfection is increasingly being considered in studies looking at the pathogenesis of COPD exacerbation. Such studies categorize exacerbations of COPD due to respiratory infection as being caused by viral infection alone, bacterial infection alone, or both [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-for-infection-in-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/16,42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,42,43</a>]. In one study, exacerbations were equally distributed across the three categories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-for-infection-in-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Coinfection appears to increase the severity of COPD exacerbations. In a study of inpatients, coinfection was associated with a greater decrement of lung function and longer hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-for-infection-in-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In a similar study of outpatients, coinfection was associated with more symptoms, a larger fall in the forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>), higher bacterial loads, and systemic inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-for-infection-in-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>In a human experimental model of rhinovirus-induced exacerbations, 15 days after inoculation with rhinovirus, a majority of individuals with COPD developed secondary bacterial infection, highlighting the importance of coinfection or sequential infection in exacerbations of COPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-for-infection-in-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. A study employing microbiome analyses to longitudinally collected sputum samples before, at, and after exacerbations demonstrated little change in microbial community structure but increased abundance of <em>Proteobacteria</em> at the time of exacerbations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-for-infection-in-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3983253368\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION FOR INFECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While bacterial and viral infections are common causes of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) exacerbations, determining which patients have a treatable infectious cause of their exacerbation can be difficult. Precise knowledge of the presence and type of infecting organism, when available, enables antibiotic therapy to be targeted to those who are most likely to benefit. Certain patient characteristics and tests can help narrow down the likelihood of bacterial or viral infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2250763466\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical characteristics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical indicators of potential bacterial infection include more severe COPD (eg, forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV<sub>1</sub>] &lt;50 percent of predicted) and sputum purulence as part of the exacerbation. In one study of 40 patients with COPD exacerbations in whom bronchoscopy was performed, more patients with purulent sputum had bronchial infection than patients with mucoid sputum (77 versus 6 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-for-infection-in-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. In a separate study, sputum purulence correlated with increased airway bacteria concentrations and sputum neutrophilia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-for-infection-in-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Based on these observations, we believe that sputum purulence is an important, but not absolute, indicator of bacterial infection in patients with an exacerbation of COPD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1950360483\"><span class=\"h2\">Sputum studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Detection of bacterial infection by sputum Gram stain, culture, or molecular testing is not recommended by the 2016 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) guidelines for the majority of COPD exacerbations because sputum cultures are unreliable and molecular methods are not widely available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-for-infection-in-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/1,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,48</a>]. However, we believe that sputum Gram stain and culture should be performed in the following patient groups:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Patients with risk factors for </strong><strong><em>Pseudomonas</em></strong><strong> infection</strong> &ndash; Risk factors for <em>Pseudomonas </em>infection include recent hospitalization (&ge;2 days' duration during the past 90 days), frequent administration of antibiotics (&ge;4 courses within the past year), severe COPD (FEV<sub>1</sub> &lt;50 percent of predicted), isolation of <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa </em>during a previous exacerbation, <em>Pseudomonas</em> colonization during a stable period, and systemic glucocorticoid use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-for-infection-in-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/1,49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,49,50</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In contrast to <em>H. influenzae</em>, <em>M. catarrhalis</em>, and <em>S. pneumoniae</em>, which are difficult to isolate from sputum cultures, <em>Pseudomonas </em>spp can be easily recovered from expectorated sputum obtained before initiating therapy. In addition, the susceptibility pattern of <em>Pseudomonas</em> is unpredictable, making the susceptibility results important for guiding the choice of antibiotic.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Patients with failure to improve on initial empiric antibiotics</strong> &ndash; The GOLD guidelines suggest that sputum Gram stain and culture may be helpful in patients who are strongly suspected of having a bacterial infection but fail to respond to initial antibiotic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-for-infection-in-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, even these cultures should be interpreted with caution because of their unreliability.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Patients with impending or actual acute respiratory failure due to an exacerbation of COPD</strong> &ndash; We obtain a Gram stain and sputum culture in these patients even in the absence of clear risk factors for <em>Pseudomonas</em> infection. Gram stain and culture showing a likely pathogen in large concentrations generally reflects the etiologic agent.</p><p/><p>The evidence demonstrating the limited utility of routine sputum Gram stain and culture includes the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gram stain and culture of expectorated sputum yield similar results during exacerbations and stable disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-for-infection-in-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In other words, they do not distinguish between true pathogens and colonizing flora. The molecular testing studies cited in the preceding section showed that newly acquired bacterial strains are often associated with exacerbations, but identification of these strains requires specialized tests that are not available for routine clinical use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-for-infection-in-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>] (see <a href=\"#H854541689\" class=\"local\">'Bacteria'</a> above). Additional supporting evidence is the presence of a likely pathogen seen on Gram stain and recovered from culture with heavy growth. Also, the failure to grow an easily cultured pathogen such as gram-negative bacilli or <em>S. aureus</em> from a purulent pretreatment specimen is evidence against their role in the exacerbation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common bacterial pathogens (<em>Haemophilus influenzae</em>, <em>Moraxella catarrhalis</em>, <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em>) are frequently difficult to isolate in sputum, which increases the likelihood of a false-negative result. In one study that collected sequential sputum cultures from patients with stable COPD, molecular typing revealed that apparently identical bacterial strains of <em>H. influenzae </em>were intermittently recovered, suggesting that false-negative culture results were common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-for-infection-in-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Support for this hypothesis was provided by the observation that strain-specific <em>H. influenzae </em>DNA was detected in some culture-negative sputum samples. <em>H. influenzae </em>is particularly problematic because <em>H. haemolyticus</em>, which is not a pathogen, is frequently misidentified as <em>H. influenzae </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-for-infection-in-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Studies comparing culture to quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for the three most common bacterial pathogens (<em>H. influenzae</em>, <em>M. catarrhalis</em>, <em>S. pneumoniae</em>) also demonstrated a doubling of pathogen detection with the latter technique, confirming the low sensitivity of sputum culture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-for-infection-in-exacerbations-of-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>].

We therefore test for influenza in all patients with COPD exacerbations when influenza is suspected (eg, the patient presents during influenza season). Rapid point-of-care diagnostic tests can be done in an emergency room or office without a laboratory technician; these tests show specificity is &gt;95 percent, but sensitivity is only about 50 to 60 percent, so a negative result does not rule out influenza. Real-time reverse-transcriptase PCR is the test of choice to diagnose influenza but requires a laboratory and a laboratory technician.
