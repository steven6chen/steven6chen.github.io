The importance of recognizing and managing injuries to the spinal column is underscored by their association with spinal cord injury.</p><p>The management of spinal column injuries and other issues related to spinal cord injury are discussed elsewhere.

Spinal column injury rates reported in other studies range from 2 to 6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-column-injuries-in-adults-definitions-mechanisms-and-radiographs/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The incidence is likely to be significantly higher in patients with head trauma and those who are unconscious at presentation. Fracture of the thoracolumbar spine, including spinous and transverse process fractures, may occur in as many as 8 to 15 percent of blunt trauma patients cared for at major trauma centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-column-injuries-in-adults-definitions-mechanisms-and-radiographs/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Additional noncontiguous spine fractures are common in patients diagnosed with a spine fracture following high-energy blunt trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-column-injuries-in-adults-definitions-mechanisms-and-radiographs/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. A review of over 83,000 patients from the United States National Trauma Data Bank diagnosed with a spine fracture reported that 19 percent sustained a noncontiguous spine fracture.</p><p>A systematic review of 13 international studies found great variation (up to a threefold difference) in the rate of spinal column injury among nations, particularly between developed and developing nations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-column-injuries-in-adults-definitions-mechanisms-and-radiographs/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Most studies demonstrate a bimodal age distribution where the first peak is found in young adults between 15 and 29 years of age and a second peak in adults older than 65 years of age. In the United States, the average age of injury has increased from 29 years in the 1970s to 42 years in 2015 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-column-injuries-in-adults-definitions-mechanisms-and-radiographs/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Mortality is significantly higher in elder patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-column-injuries-in-adults-definitions-mechanisms-and-radiographs/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Spinal column injuries are more common in males. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=geriatric-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Geriatric trauma: Initial evaluation and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Note that statistics from trauma registries can be incomplete and inaccurate, depending on the inclusion criteria, and may underestimate the number of patients with spinal column injury. As examples, victims who die at the accident scene and patients whose neurologic deficits rapidly improve are often not included. </p><p>Motor vehicle related accidents account for almost half of all spinal injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-column-injuries-in-adults-definitions-mechanisms-and-radiographs/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], and speeding, alcohol intoxication, and failure to use restraints are the major risk factors. However, the most rapidly increasing cause of spinal injuries is violent trauma, whereas injuries from vehicular accident are decreasing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-column-injuries-in-adults-definitions-mechanisms-and-radiographs/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Occupants involved in a rollover accident are at increased risk of a cervical spine injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-column-injuries-in-adults-definitions-mechanisms-and-radiographs/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Other common causes include falls, followed by acts of violence (primarily gunshot wounds), and sporting activities. The falls of older adults account for a growing proportion of spinal injuries, reflecting the aging population of many developing countries. Missed or delayed diagnosis of spinal column trauma results in a 7.5-fold increase in the incidence of neurologic injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-column-injuries-in-adults-definitions-mechanisms-and-radiographs/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The human spine consists of 33 bony vertebrae: 7 cervical, 12 thoracic, 5 lumbar, 5 sacral (fused), and 4 coccygeal (usually fused) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-column-injuries-in-adults-definitions-mechanisms-and-radiographs/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. These 26 individual units are separated by intervertebral disks and connected by a network of ligaments. The vertebral column provides the body's basic structural support and also protects the spinal cord, which extends from the midbrain caudally to the level of the second lumbar vertebra and then continues as the cauda equina.</p><p>Pictures and radiographs depicting the details of spinal anatomy are found below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spine anatomy overview (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F64902\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64902 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F60856\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef60856 \">image 1</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vertebral anatomy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F58088\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58088 \">figure 2</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cervical vertebrae (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F81612\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81612 \">figure 3</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>C1 and C2 vertebrae details (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F61029\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61029 \">figure 4</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thoracic vertebrae (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54473\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54473 \">figure 5</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cervical joints and ligaments (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F79763\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79763 \">figure 6</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skull and superior cervical spine interface (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F72810\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72810 \">figure 7</a>)</p><p/><p>Due to its exposed location above the torso and its inherent flexibility, the cervical spine is the most commonly injured part of the spinal column. Within the cervical spine, the most common sites of injury are around the second cervical vertebra (C2, or axis) or in the region of C5, C6 and C7 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-column-injuries-in-adults-definitions-mechanisms-and-radiographs/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>In contrast, the thoracic spine is rigidly fixed, as the thoracic ribs articulate with the respective transverse processes and sternum. Thus, a great amount of force is necessary to damage the thoracic spine of an otherwise healthy adult. In older adults with osteoporosis or patients with bone disease or metastatic lesions minor trauma may be sufficient to cause a compression fracture.</p><p>The second most commonly injured region is the thoracolumbar (TL) junction. The orientation of the facet joints at the TL junction may concentrate forces created from traumatic impact at this level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-column-injuries-in-adults-definitions-mechanisms-and-radiographs/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. At the TL junction, the spinal column changes from a kyphotic to a lordotic curve. Ninety percent of all TL spine injuries occur in the region between T11 and L4. However, these injuries rarely result in complete cord lesions as the spinal canal is relatively wide at this level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-column-injuries-in-adults-definitions-mechanisms-and-radiographs/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISMS OF INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spinal column injury may result in spinal cord or brain injury through a number of mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-column-injuries-in-adults-definitions-mechanisms-and-radiographs/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transection &ndash; Penetrating or massive blunt trauma resulting in spinal column injury may transect all or part of the spinal cord; less severe trauma may have similar neurologic effects by displacing bony fragments into the spinal canal or through disk herniation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute traumatic spinal cord injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Compression &ndash; When elderly patients with cervical osteoarthritis and spondylosis forcibly extend their neck, the spinal cord may be compressed between an arthritically enlarged anterior vertebral ridge and a posteriorly located hypertrophied ligamentum flavum. Injuries that produce blood within the spinal canal can also compress the spinal cord. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disorders affecting the spinal cord&quot;, section on 'Spinal epidural hematoma'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contusion &ndash; Contusions of the spinal cord can occur from bony dislocations, subluxations, or fracture fragments. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vascular compromise &ndash; Primary vascular damage to the spinal cord should be suspected when there is a discrepancy between a clinically apparent neurologic deficit and the known level of spinal column injury. As an example, when a lower cervical dislocation compresses the vertebral arteries within the spinal foramina of the vertebrae, thrombosis and decreased blood flow through the anterior spinal artery may result. The anterior spinal artery originates from both vertebral arteries at the level of C1. This injury may erroneously appear to localize to the level of C1 or C2 rather than the site of the dislocation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disorders affecting the spinal cord&quot;, section on 'Spinal cord infarction'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition, a number of spinal fracture patterns are closely associated with vertebral artery injuries, which can cause stroke and permanent disability if diagnosis and appropriate interventions are delayed. Injuries of concern include fractures associated with displacement into the transverse foramen, fractures involving both the atlas (C1) and axis (C2), fractures involving the transverse foramen, and subluxation of two or more adjacent cervical vertebral levels. Cerebrovascular injuries are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-mechanisms-screening-and-diagnostic-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blunt cerebrovascular injury: Mechanisms, screening, and diagnostic evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Certain conditions predispose patients to cervical spinal column injury. Down syndrome patients are predisposed to atlanto-axial dislocation; patients with rheumatoid arthritis are prone to rupture of the transverse ligament of C2. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=down-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Down syndrome: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-subluxation-in-rheumatoid-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical subluxation in rheumatoid arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CERVICAL SPINAL COLUMN INJURY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Cervical spinal column injury classification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute cervical spinal column injury may be classified according to the stability of the injury, its location, or the mechanism (flexion, flexion-rotation, extension, and vertical compression) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F52922\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52922 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-column-injuries-in-adults-definitions-mechanisms-and-radiographs/abstract/12,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,16</a>].</p><p>To assess the stability of cervical spinal column injuries below C2, the spine is viewed as consisting of two columns. The anterior column is formed by vertebral bodies and intervertebral disks, which are held in alignment by the anterior and posterior longitudinal ligaments. The posterior column, which contains the spinal canal, is formed by the pedicles, transverse processes, articulating facets, laminae, and spinous processes. The nuchal ligament complex (supraspinous, interspinous, and infraspinous ligaments), capsular ligaments, and ligamentum flavum hold the posterior column in alignment.</p><p>If both columns are disrupted, the cervical spine can move as two independent units, and there is a high risk of causing or exacerbating a spinal cord injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-column-injuries-in-adults-definitions-mechanisms-and-radiographs/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In contrast, if only one column is disrupted and the other column maintains structural integrity, the risk of spinal cord injury is far less.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Atlanto-occipital dislocation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pure flexion injuries involving the atlas (C1) and the axis (C2) can cause an unstable atlanto-occipital or atlanto-axial joint dislocation, with or without an associated odontoid fracture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51624\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef51624 \">image 2</a>).</p><p>Several measurements are used to determine the presence of atlanto-occipital joint dislocation on plain lateral radiograph of the cervical spine; however, their accuracy and interobserver reliability are not well studied in trauma patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-column-injuries-in-adults-definitions-mechanisms-and-radiographs/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>The basion-posterior axial line interval (BAI) and the basion-dental interval (BDI) demonstrate consistent relationships in normal adults (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F72666\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72666 \">figure 8</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-column-injuries-in-adults-definitions-mechanisms-and-radiographs/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. They are determined by using a line drawn along the posterior border of the anterior body of C2. Two lines are then drawn from this line: one perpendicularly to the basion (ie, tip of the clivus at the occipital base) and another from the basion to the tip of the dens. A sum of these two lines originating from the basion exceeding 12 mm suggests atlanto-occipital joint dislocation.</p><p>The Powers ratio is commonly used to assess for atlanto-occipital dislocation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51652\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51652 \">figure 9</a>). It is defined by the ratio of BC:OA, where BC is the distance between the basion and the midpoint of the posterior laminar line of C1, and OA is the distance between the midpoint of the posterior margin of the foramen magnum (opisthion) and the midpoint of the posterior surface of the anterior arch of C1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-column-injuries-in-adults-definitions-mechanisms-and-radiographs/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. A ratio greater than one suggests anterior subluxation.</p><p>Another radiologic finding suggestive of an atlanto-occipital dislocation is disruption of the &quot;basilar line of Wackenheim,&quot; a line drawn from the posterior surface of the clivus to the odontoid tip [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-column-injuries-in-adults-definitions-mechanisms-and-radiographs/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Normally, the inferior extension of this line should just touch the posterior aspect of the tip of the odontoid. If the line runs anterior or posterior to the odontoid tip, this suggests an atlanto-occipital dislocation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Atlanto-axial dislocation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rotary atlanto-axial dislocation is an unstable injury, caused by a flexion-rotation mechanism, best visualized on open-mouth odontoid radiographs or CT scan (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F71575\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71575 \">figure 10</a>). The interpretation of odontoid radiographs warrants careful attention, since there may be false positive asymmetry between the odontoid process and the lateral masses of C1 if the skull is rotated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F57856\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef57856 \">image 3</a>). When the radiograph reveals symmetric basilar skull structures, a unilaterally magnified lateral mass confirms a C1-C2 dislocation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">C1 (Atlas) fractures</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Burst (Jefferson)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Jefferson fracture of C1 is highly unstable and occurs when a vertical compression force is transmitted through the occipital condyles to the lateral masses of the atlas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F77232\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef77232 \">image 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F64434\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef64434 \">image 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51760\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51760 \">figure 11</a>). This force drives the lateral masses outward, resulting in fractures of the anterior and posterior arches of the C1, with or without disruption of the transverse ligament. Disruption of the transverse ligament determines instability.</p><p>Prevertebral hemorrhage combined with disruption of the transverse ligament may cause an increase in the predental space between C1 and the odontoid (dens) seen on the lateral radiograph. A predental space greater than 3 mm in adults or 5 mm in children is abnormal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-column-injuries-in-adults-definitions-mechanisms-and-radiographs/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In the anterior-posterior (AP) projection (open-mouth or odontoid view), the masses of C1 lie lateral to the outer margins of the articular pillars of C2 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F83144\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef83144 \">image 6</a>). The Jefferson fracture may be difficult to recognize on plain radiograph if there is minimal displacement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-column-injuries-in-adults-definitions-mechanisms-and-radiographs/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>The transverse ligament is presumed to be disrupted if the interval between the atlas and the dens is increased on a lateral radiograph, or the lateral masses of the atlas extend laterally beyond those of the axis on the odontoid radiograph. In such instances, clinicians should obtain a computed tomography (CT) scan of the cervical spine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Posterior arch</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A posterior neural arch fracture of C1 results from compression of the posterior elements between the occiput and the spinous process of C2 during forced neck extension. A vertical fracture line through the posterior neural arch is seen on lateral radiograph (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F63483\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef63483 \">image 7</a>). Although mechanically stable because the anterior arch and the transverse ligament remain intact, this fracture is potentially dangerous because of its location. Anterior displacement of the atlas greater than 1 cm can injure adjacent spinal cord.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">C2 (Axis) pedicle fractures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Traumatic spondylolysis of C2 (so-called &quot;hangman's fracture&quot;) is an unstable injury that occurs when the cervicocranium (the skull, atlas, and axis functioning as a unit) is thrown into extreme hyperextension as a result of abrupt deceleration (ie, forced extension of an already extended neck) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F55675\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef55675 \">image 8</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F77333\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77333 \">figure 12</a>). Bilateral pedicle fractures of the axis may occur with or without dislocation in this circumstance. Although this lesion is unstable, spinal cord damage is often minimal because the AP diameter of the neural canal is greatest at C2, and bilateral pedicle fractures permit spinal canal decompression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-column-injuries-in-adults-definitions-mechanisms-and-radiographs/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Odontoid fractures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Forceful flexion or extension of the head in an anterior-posterior orientation (ie, sagittal plane), as might occur with a forward fall onto the forehead, may result in a fracture of the odontoid process, also called the dens. Fractures can occur above the transverse ligaments (type I) or, most commonly, at the base of the odontoid process where it attaches to C2 (type II) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F81657\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef81657 \">image 9</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F70344\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70344 \">figure 13</a>). Type I fractures are stable. Although spinal cord injury is uncommon, type II odontoid fractures are unstable and complicated by nonunion in over 50 percent of patients treated with halo vest immobilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-column-injuries-in-adults-definitions-mechanisms-and-radiographs/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Slight angulation of the force may result in extension of the fracture through the upper portion of the body of C2 (type III) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F56938\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef56938 \">image 10</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F70344\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70344 \">figure 13</a>). Type III fractures are mechanically unstable, since they allow the odontoid and the occiput to move as a unit. Odontoid fractures are best seen on the AP odontoid radiograph (ie, open-mouth view) and cause prevertebral soft tissue swelling on lateral radiographs. Caution is necessary when interpreting the open mouth view as a radiographic line created by the space between the two front incisors may be confused for a dens fracture.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Anterior wedge</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Forceful flexion of the cervical spine can compress the anterior portion of a vertebral body, creating an anterior wedge fracture. Spinal instability can result if anterior wedge fractures are severe (loss of over half the height of the anterior vertebral body) or multiple adjacent wedge fractures occur (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F55806\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef55806 \">image 11</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F63517\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef63517 \">image 12</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F77831\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77831 \">figure 14</a>). &#160;</p><p>In pure flexion injuries below C2, the strong nuchal ligament complex usually remains intact, and most of the force is expended on the vertebral body anteriorly, causing a simple wedge fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-column-injuries-in-adults-definitions-mechanisms-and-radiographs/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

The larger piece displaces posteriorly as a unit with the superior cervical spine relative to the vertebrae below. The anterior fragment typically remains aligned with the inferior cervical vertebrae. If there is no posterior displacement of the superior column, widening of the interlaminar and interspinous spaces supports the diagnosis of a flexion teardrop fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-column-injuries-in-adults-definitions-mechanisms-and-radiographs/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>The severe anterior flexion involved in this injury creates distraction forces at the posterior cervical spine and disruption of the posterior longitudinal ligament.

Such forces are applied from above (via the skull) or below (via the pelvis or feet), and may cause one or more vertebral body end-plates to fracture. When the nucleus pulposus of the intervertebral disk is forced into the vertebral body, the body shatters outward, resulting in a burst fracture. The lateral radiograph shows a comminuted vertebral body and loss of vertebral height, while the anterior-posterior (AP) radiograph demonstrates a characteristic vertical fracture of the vertebral body (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F52072\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef52072 \">image 16</a>). </p><p>Although technically burst fractures are &quot;stable&quot; since all ligaments remain intact, posteriorly displaced fracture fragments may impinge on the spinal cord, causing an anterior cord syndrome.

The pattern of the fracture often reflects the mechanism of injury. Vertical lamina fractures are thought to result from axial loading, whereas transverse fractures often represent avulsion fractures from hyperflexion. Although rare, isolated lamina fractures, which are generally not associated with instability, can be treated nonoperatively with cervical collar immobilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-column-injuries-in-adults-definitions-mechanisms-and-radiographs/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Facet dislocations</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Bilateral</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bilateral facet dislocations occur when flexion forces extend anteriorly, causing disruption of the annulus fibrosus of the intervertebral disc and the anterior longitudinal ligament, resulting in extreme instability. The inferior articulating facets of the upper vertebra pass over the superior facets of the lower vertebra, resulting in anterior displacement of the spine. Complete spinal cord injury most often results. Radiographically, the displacement will appear to be greater than one half of the anteroposterior (AP) diameter of the lower vertebral body with the superior facets anterior to the inferior facets, which is best seen on the lateral view (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73643\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef73643 \">image 18</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F79346\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef79346 \">image 19</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">Unilateral</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unilateral facet dislocations involve flexion and rotation.

Since the dislocated articular mass is locked in place, this is a stable injury despite posterior ligament complex disruption. Spinal cord injury rarely occurs following isolated unilateral facet dislocation.

This injury pattern is more common in children and has been attributed to several causes, including ligamentous injuries, disc prolapse, and cervical spondylosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spine-injuries-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and acute management of cervical spine injuries in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Clinicians should suspect a cervical ligamentous injury in the injured patient who has persistent severe pain or paresthesias or focal neurologic findings (eg, upper extremity weakness) in the absence of a fracture seen on plain radiographs or CT.

Some of the more clinically relevant classification schemes are described here.</p><p>In contrast to the two column scheme for cervical spinal column injury, a three column scheme may be used to describe injuries of the thoracic and lumbar (TL) spinal column [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-column-injuries-in-adults-definitions-mechanisms-and-radiographs/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The three columns are anterior, middle, and posterior (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F79986\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79986 \">figure 17</a>). The anterior column includes the anterior longitudinal ligament, the annulus fibrosus, and the anterior half of the vertebral body. The middle column comprises the posterior longitudinal ligament, the posterior annulus fibrosus, and the posterior half of the vertebral body. The posterior column includes the supraspinous and interspinous ligaments, as well as the facet joint capsule.</p><p>According to the three column scheme, stability is based upon the integrity of two of the three spinal columns. Spinal instability may be inferred when plain radiographs demonstrate a loss of 50 percent of vertebral height or excessive kyphotic angulation around the fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-column-injuries-in-adults-definitions-mechanisms-and-radiographs/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The angle is determined by the intersection of two lines, one measured along the superior endplate of the vertebral body one level above the fracture and the other along the inferior endplate of the vertebral body one level below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-column-injuries-in-adults-definitions-mechanisms-and-radiographs/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Compression fractures with greater than 30 degrees and burst fractures with greater than 25 degrees angulation are generally considered unstable. The presence of a neurologic deficit also indicates spinal instability, since the spinal column has failed to protect the spinal cord [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-column-injuries-in-adults-definitions-mechanisms-and-radiographs/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p>Few studies have been performed to validate the three column scheme. In a biomechanical study of cadaveric human spines, researchers found the middle column to be the major determinant of spine stability when axial or flexion stress was applied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-column-injuries-in-adults-definitions-mechanisms-and-radiographs/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>TL injuries can be divided into four basic patterns: wedge compression fractures, stable and unstable burst fractures, flexion-distraction injuries, and translational injuries. All of these fractures result from one or more of three mechanisms of injury: axial compression, axial distraction, and translation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-column-injuries-in-adults-definitions-mechanisms-and-radiographs/abstract/30,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,35</a>]. A widely used classification for TL spinal column injury combines a distinction between major and minor fracture patterns using the three column scheme and the five injury patterns.</p><p>In 2005, the Spine Trauma Study Group introduced a classification system for thoracolumbar injuries called the Thoracolumbar Injury Classification and Severity Score (TLICS). This score assigns numerical values to each injury based upon morphology, neurologic status, and integrity of the posterior ligamentous complex, which includes the supraspinous ligament, interspinous ligament, ligamentum flavum, and facet joint capsules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-column-injuries-in-adults-definitions-mechanisms-and-radiographs/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

They usually result from compressive failure of the anterior column under an axial load applied in flexion. Injuries that do not disrupt the posterior ligament complex are stable. An additional rotational force is necessary to cause an unstable fracture pattern. If there is severe compression (&gt;50 percent of vertebral height), significant fracture kyphosis (&gt;30 degrees), a rotational component to the injury, or compression fractures at multiple levels, then the posterior ligamentous complex may fail and progress to involve the middle column, resulting in spinal instability (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F83140\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef83140 \">image 22</a>). Fractures with any of these characteristics or a TLICS score &ge;4 warrant imaging with computed tomography (CT). Fracture kyphosis is described above. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'TL spinal column injury classification'</a> above.)</p><p>Compression fractures that exhibit between 10 and 40 percent compression are managed on a case-by-case basis in consultation with a spine surgeon. Neurologic findings or concomitant injuries warrant a thorough evaluation. Management of spinal column injury is discussed separately.

Thus, CT should be performed when plain radiographs suggest any possible involvement of the posterior cortex in what appears to be a wedge compression fracture.

Spinal cord injury from retropulsion of bony fragments into the spinal canal can occur.</p><p>Burst injuries can occur with or without injury to posterior elements; posterior element involvement increases the risk for neurologic deficits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-column-injuries-in-adults-definitions-mechanisms-and-radiographs/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Burst fractures are most commonly associated with falls and motor vehicle collisions. All burst fractures should be considered unstable, since neurologic deficits are seen in 42 to 58 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-column-injuries-in-adults-definitions-mechanisms-and-radiographs/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>Burst fractures can be difficult to visualize and are often misdiagnosed by plain radiography because posteriorly displaced bone fragments often lie at the level of the pedicles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-column-injuries-in-adults-definitions-mechanisms-and-radiographs/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Lateral radiographs of burst fractures may demonstrate a loss of anterior and posterior vertebral height, and may show a distorted posterior longitudinal ligament line. AP radiographs may demonstrate a widening of the interpedicular distance (&gt;1 mm difference between the vertebrae above and below).</p><p>Unstable burst fractures are often misdiagnosed as stable anterior wedge fractures. In one retrospective trial, 6 experienced radiologists correctly identified only 30 of 39 burst fractures among 53 thoracolumbar radiographs reviewed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-column-injuries-in-adults-definitions-mechanisms-and-radiographs/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

Classically the patient is wearing only a lap belt, positioned incorrectly above the pelvic bones. Sudden deceleration during a collision causes forceful flexion at the lap belt, leading to compressive failure of the anterior and middle columns and a tear in the posterior longitudinal ligament. Chance fractures are often misdiagnosed as compression fractures. Pure ligamentous disruptions also occur and account for 10 to 25 percent of flexion-distraction injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-column-injuries-in-adults-definitions-mechanisms-and-radiographs/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>In contrast to the cervical region, where articular processes are small, flat, and almost horizontal, articular processes in the lumbar region are large, curved, and nearly vertical, and thus, unilateral facet dislocations are rare. Instead, one or both articular processes fracture, and the upper vertebra swings forward, resulting in an unstable fracture-dislocation pattern.</p><p>Radiographic findings of flexion-distraction injuries include compression fractures of the vertebral body, and increased posterior interspinous spaces caused by distraction. A characteristic finding is increased length of the vertebral segment as a result of distraction. Displacement is unusual, since the mechanism does not involve a significant rotational or translational component.</p><p>Flexion-distraction injuries may be missed on routine axial CT scans since the disruption is oriented in the horizontal plane.

Patients with a complete vertebral dislocation from massive trauma almost invariably demonstrate neurologic deficits.</p><p>Among patients rendered paraplegic from TL trauma, the majority have sustained a fracture-dislocation injury (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F61587\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef61587 \">image 29</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F83508\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef83508 \">image 30</a>). Approximately 26 to 40 percent of these result in permanent neurologic deficits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-column-injuries-in-adults-definitions-mechanisms-and-radiographs/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Most patients also sustain multiorgan system trauma.</p><p>Shear fractures and pure dislocations result in severe neurologic injury, causing complete paraplegia in nearly all patients. Pure dislocations appear as a complete displacement of the superior vertebrae relative to the one below. Fracture fragments created by shearing forces may lodge in the spinal canal. CT scan is helpful in evaluating these injuries because it quantifies the extent of spinal cord impingement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h2\">Other TL fracture patterns</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Minor spinal fracture patterns account for 14 percent of all TL injuries and include isolated transverse process fractures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F83469\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef83469 \">image 31</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F83470\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef83470 \">image 32</a>), spinous process fractures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F86897\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef86897 \">image 33</a>), facet or laminar fractures, bipedicular fractures, and fractures of the pars interarticularis. Most minor spinal fractures occur in the lumbar region and are caused by direct blows. Sudden contraction of the psoas muscles can result in avulsion of a transverse process.</p><p>While transverse process fractures are considered stable, in high velocity trauma they frequently do <strong>not</strong> occur in isolation. In one retrospective analysis of 28 patients who initially appeared to have isolated transverse process fractures by plain radiographs, three patients were subsequently found to have compression and burst fractures by CT scan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-column-injuries-in-adults-definitions-mechanisms-and-radiographs/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. High thoracic spinous process fractures may be associated with brachial plexus injury, while lumbar and sacral spinous process fractures may cause lumbosacral plexus injury. To ensure appropriate diagnosis and management of spinal column injury, a CT should be obtained when transverse process fractures are seen on plain radiographs.</p><p>When associated with a burst fracture, the presence of thoracic or lumbar laminar fractures indicates potential instability and a greater severity of injury, due to the greater chance of damage to the posterior dural sac and compression of neural structures between the laminar fragments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-column-injuries-in-adults-definitions-mechanisms-and-radiographs/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. In an observational study of 146 patients, the presence of a laminar fracture was associated with greater narrowing of the spinal canal (47 versus 28 percent) and a higher mean injury severity score (ISS) (17 versus 12) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-column-injuries-in-adults-definitions-mechanisms-and-radiographs/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients.

Approximately three percent of blunt trauma patients sustain such an injury. Elder patients who fall are also at risk. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The cervical spine is the most commonly injured part of the spinal column. Within the cervical spine, the most common sites of injury are around the second cervical vertebra (C2, or axis) or in the region of C5, C6, and C7. The anatomy of the spinal column and common mechanisms of injury are described in the text. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Anatomy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Mechanisms of injury'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Associated injury of the spinal cord or possibly the brain (due to vascular compromise) are critical clinical considerations and must be investigated immediately. In the absence of apparent spinal cord or brain injury, the degree of fracture stability is the most important feature of any spinal column injury. The stability of common spinal injuries is described in the text and summarized in the accompanying table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F52922\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52922 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute traumatic spinal cord injury&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blunt-cerebrovascular-injury-mechanisms-screening-and-diagnostic-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blunt cerebrovascular injury: Mechanisms, screening, and diagnostic evaluation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Cervical spinal column injury'</a> above and <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Thoracic and lumbar (TL) spinal column injury'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Differences in the structure and location of the cervical and thoracolumbar portions of the spinal column lead to different types of injuries, although there is some overlap. The cervical spinal column is susceptible to a wide range of fractures, dislocations, and ligamentous injuries. Compression fractures are the most common injury of the thoracolumbar spinal column.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">National Spinal Cord Injury Association Resource Center. www.sci-info-pages.com/factsheets.html (Accessed on February 20, 2018).</li><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spinal-column-injuries-in-adults-definitions-mechanisms-and-radiographs/abstract/2\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Greenbaum J, Walters N, Levy PD.
