These same considerations with respect to AV fistulas are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-fistula-maintenance-and-thrombosis-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hemodialysis arteriovenous fistula maintenance and thrombosis prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1314907429\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS FOR AV GRAFT THROMBOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Arteriovenous (AV) graft thrombosis can occur immediately following AV graft creation, usually related to technical issues, or later after using the access for a variable period of time predominantly due to stenotic lesions that develop from intimal hyperplasia. More than 90 percent of thrombosed grafts have a stenotic lesion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemodialysis-arteriovenous-graft-dysfunction-and-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemodialysis arteriovenous graft dysfunction and failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Stenosis of a hemodialysis AV graft is initiated by endothelial cell injury, which leads to the upregulation of adhesion molecules on the endothelial cell surface. Subsequent leukocyte adherence to damaged and activated endothelium causes the release of chemotactic and mitogenic factors for vascular smooth muscle cells, thereby enhancing smooth muscle cell migration and proliferation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-graft-maintenance-and-thrombosis-prevention/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Additional factors that contribute to the neointimal proliferation and fibromuscular hyperplasia include shear stress generated by the turbulent blood flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-graft-maintenance-and-thrombosis-prevention/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>] and the mismatch in elastic properties around the anastomosis leading to excessive mechanical stretch [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-graft-maintenance-and-thrombosis-prevention/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Activated platelets and inflammatory cells also secrete oxidants and other toxins that directly injure the vessel wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-graft-maintenance-and-thrombosis-prevention/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Measures aimed at reducing neointimal hyperplasia as well as other pharmacologic agents that address other elements underlying vascular stenosis may help prevent stenosis. (See <a href=\"#H1586492959\" class=\"local\">'High-risk AV grafts'</a> below.)</p><p>Other factors that can lead to AV graft dysfunction and thrombosis include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preexisting stenotic lesions</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cannulation <span class=\"nowrap\">injury/more</span> frequent cannulation (eg, daily hemodialysis)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Infiltration/hematoma</span> formation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recurrent stenosis after angioplasty</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior stenting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypercoagulable states</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thrombosis of a pseudoaneurysm</p><p/><p>Pseudoaneurysms, which may result from repeated cannulation at one site, can rupture or become infected.

Symptoms, such as increased swelling, or severe pain require urgent evaluation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonthrombotic-complications-of-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access#H12722594\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonthrombotic complications of arteriovenous hemodialysis access&quot;, section on 'Extremity swelling'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonthrombotic-complications-of-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access#H12722337\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonthrombotic complications of arteriovenous hemodialysis access&quot;, section on 'Extremity ischemia'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3455196172\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AV grafts are initially evaluated after their creation for usability. Once in use, the AV graft should be examined at each dialysis session and monitored for any problems with dialysis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-examination-of-the-arteriovenous-graft\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical examination of the arteriovenous graft&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=monitoring-and-surveillance-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-grafts-to-prevent-thrombosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Monitoring and surveillance of hemodialysis arteriovenous grafts to prevent thrombosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients should be taught to examine the AV graft between dialysis sessions for a thrill. If a thrill cannot be felt, there is a change from the prior examination, or there is redness or swelling of the arm, the patient should inform the staff at the dialysis unit as soon as possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-graft-maintenance-and-thrombosis-prevention/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. There are no data to suggest that a delay in addressing AV graft thrombosis affects outcomes of intervention. However, detecting and reporting possible thrombosis as soon as possible may allow intervention prior to the next dialysis session. This reduces the risk of missing or delaying the dialysis session, which can lead to hyperkalemia and volume overload. Early thrombectomy may also decrease the need of requiring a temporary catheter.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3995667521\"><span class=\"h2\">Cannulation and decannulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Proper cannulation and decannulation are important for preventing complications that can cause AV graft thrombosis. Hemodialysis staff should be appropriately trained, and only those with technical mastery should be allowed to cannulate a newly created graft [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-graft-maintenance-and-thrombosis-prevention/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2286527903\"><span class=\"h3\">Inspection prior to initial cannulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The newly created AV graft should be examined by an experienced clinician to determine if it is clinically usable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-graft-maintenance-and-thrombosis-prevention/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The AV graft must have an appropriate depth and location that allows cannulation with a minimal risk for infiltration and the ability to deliver adequate blood flow. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-chronic-hemodialysis-vascular-access\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of chronic hemodialysis vascular access&quot;</a>.)</p><p>New AV grafts can usually be cannulated two weeks after placement. If the AV graft is judged to be ready, cannulation and hemodialysis can be initiated. However, the initial cannulation should be delayed if there is residual postoperative edema over the graft. (See <a href=\"#H3169579609\" class=\"local\">'General procedure'</a> below.)</p><p>The specific interval from creation to first AV graft cannulation depends upon the specific type of graft that is used. Guidelines for use from the various manufacturers are based on the expected time needed for tissue-to-graft incorporation to minimize the likelihood of hematoma formation from blood dissecting along the perigraft space. Advances in AV graft design may allow immediate cannulation within 24 to 72 hours of placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-graft-maintenance-and-thrombosis-prevention/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. The different types of grafts, including immediate cannulation grafts, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arteriovenous-graft-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications#H928320587\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Arteriovenous graft creation for hemodialysis and its complications&quot;, section on 'Types of AV grafts'</a>.)</p><p>Self-cannulation of the AV grafts is encouraged for patients who are capable and whose access is suitably positioned [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-graft-maintenance-and-thrombosis-prevention/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3169579609\"><span class=\"h3\">General procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Appropriate sterile technique should be used. We recommend wearing gloves and masks during cannulation and appropriate hand cleansing and antiseptic cleansing of the cannulation site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-graft-maintenance-and-thrombosis-prevention/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Full barrier precautions (gowns, drapes) are generally not needed. Dialysis unit personnel should wear a gown if there is risk of contamination of the field (eg, uncontrolled diarrhea or wound drainage not contained by a dressing) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-graft-maintenance-and-thrombosis-prevention/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>These minimal standards reduce the transmission but are variably used in observational studies that have compared different dialysis facilities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-graft-maintenance-and-thrombosis-prevention/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Preventing disease transmission is important, particularly given the increasing microbial resistance to mainstream antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-graft-maintenance-and-thrombosis-prevention/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p>The standard technique for repeatedly cannulating an AV graft is using the &quot;rope-ladder&quot; technique, which simply involves rotating the cannulation sites between hemodialysis sessions. Rotation of cannulation sites is important for avoiding pseudoaneurysm formation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arteriovenous-graft-creation-for-hemodialysis-and-its-complications#H2840644592\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Arteriovenous graft creation for hemodialysis and its complications&quot;, section on 'Pseudoaneurysm'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonthrombotic-complications-of-arteriovenous-hemodialysis-access#H12721750\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonthrombotic complications of arteriovenous hemodialysis access&quot;, section on 'Aneurysm/pseudoaneurysm'</a>.)</p><p>Cannulation of a new AV graft is generally performed using a 15-gauge needle and a dialysis blood flow of 450 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/minute</span>. Our approach for cannulating an AV graft is as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-graft-maintenance-and-thrombosis-prevention/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Locate, inspect, and palpate the needle cannulation sites prior to skin preparation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wash the access site using an antibacterial soap or scrub and water. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cleanse the skin by applying 2% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorhexidine</a> <span class=\"nowrap\">gluconate/70%</span> isopropyl alcohol or 70% alcohol <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> 10% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=povidone-iodine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">povidone iodine</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the skin is touched by the patient or staff after the skin prep has been applied but the cannulation has not been completed, repeat the preparation. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of a wet needle is safer and also prevents the risk for a blood spray or spill, especially for the initial cannulation. Attach a 10-mL syringe filled with 8 mL of normal saline solution to prime the AV graft needle immediately before use, then clamp the needle. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insert the needle bevel up at an approximately 30 to 45&deg; angle. Arterial needle direction can be antegrade or retrograde to direction of blood flow; the venous needle should be antegrade to direction of blood flow.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once the vein has been penetrated, blood flashback will be visible (the needle may need to be unclamped to see the blood flashback); advance the needle slowly with the bevel up, or, for a deeper AV graft that is difficult to palpate, immediately rotate the needle 180&deg; and advance slowly with the bevel down. Tape the needle onto the skin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Confirm needle placement with a normal saline flush before connecting the needles to the blood pump and starting the pump. Blood return alone is not enough to show good needle placement. After flashback is visible, aspirate 1 to 5 mL with the 10-mL syringe, then flush the needle with the normal saline solution, looking for any signs of infiltration, then clamp the needle.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2149627099\"><span class=\"h3\">Decannulating the AV graft</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Proper needle removal prevents postdialysis infiltrations. Our approach to decannulating an AV graft is as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-graft-maintenance-and-thrombosis-prevention/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Remove the needle at approximately the same angle used for insertion. Using too steep an angle during needle removal may cause the tip to puncture the back wall.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Apply the gauze dressing over the needle site, but do not apply pressure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Apply pressure only after the needle has been completely removed.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4243190113\"><span class=\"h3\">Cannulation difficulty or failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the first cannulation is unsuccessful, the nurse or patient care technician may leave the needle in place and attempt a second cannulation at another portion of the graft. At the end of dialysis, all three needles are removed. However, in some cases, if cannulation is unsuccessful, recannulation should not be attempted again until the site has healed.</p><p>Infiltration associated with cannulation sites can occur at any time during dialysis. The patient should be monitored closely during the dialysis procedure for signs and symptoms of infiltration (pain, bruising, oozing) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-graft-maintenance-and-thrombosis-prevention/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. A quick response to a needle infiltration can help minimize damage to the access.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid lifting up on the needle after it is in the vein and use care when taping needles in place. Improper needle placement or taping procedure can cause infiltration, as can improper decannulation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the graft has infiltrated, it is best to rest that access for at least one treatment, but, if this is not possible, the next cannulation should be above the site of the infiltration. If the patient still has a catheter in place, restart use of the access with one needle.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For infiltration that occurs after the administration of heparin, leaving the needle in place and cannulating at another site may be appropriate.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3387053044\"><span class=\"h2\">Care between dialysis sessions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In between dialysis sessions, patients are instructed to keep the access extremity clean and to avoid wearing any clothing or jewelry (such as wristwatches) that restrict flow to or from the access and to refrain from activities that similarly restrict flow. Bathing and other activities can be resumed as normally tolerated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2465689138\"><span class=\"h1\">PRIMARY THROMBOSIS PREVENTION IN NEWLY CREATED GRAFTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thrombosis of a newly created arteriovenous (AV) graft is often related to underlying stenosis. The mainstay of thrombosis prevention revolves around clinical monitoring of the graft and treatment of clinically significant stenosis, prior to AV graft thrombosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=monitoring-and-surveillance-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-grafts-to-prevent-thrombosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Monitoring and surveillance of hemodialysis arteriovenous grafts to prevent thrombosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>We do <strong>not</strong> administer pharmacologic agents (eg, fish oil, anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents) prophylactically for the purpose of preventing thrombosis in a newly created AV graft in patients who are not considered high risk for AV graft thrombosis (ie, history of thrombosis within three months of surgery of a prior AV access, coagulation abnormality, hypercoagulable state). The management of the high-risk patient is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H1586492959\" class=\"local\">'High-risk AV grafts'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2072542497\"><span class=\"h2\">Angioplasty/stenting of underlying stenosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stenosis of a hemodialysis AV graft is initiated by endothelial cell injury and most often involves the venous anastomosis but may also involve the draining vein, central vein, or feeding artery; or, stenosis can be within the AV graft. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endovascular-intervention-for-the-treatment-of-stenosis-in-the-arteriovenous-access\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endovascular intervention for the treatment of stenosis in the arteriovenous access&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although monitoring for and treatment of AV graft stenosis is the mainstay of preventing AV graft thrombosis, the outcomes of <span class=\"nowrap\">angioplasty/stenting</span> for treating stenosis associated with AV grafts have been overall disappointing. Moreover, angioplasty exacerbates neointimal hyperplasia, often resulting in accelerated restenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-graft-maintenance-and-thrombosis-prevention/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endovascular-intervention-for-the-treatment-of-stenosis-in-the-arteriovenous-access\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endovascular intervention for the treatment of stenosis in the arteriovenous access&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H3769409704\" class=\"local\">'Recurrent thrombosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H296353969\"><span class=\"h2\">Prophylactic antithrombotic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Measures aimed at reducing neointimal hyperplasia as well as other mechanisms responsible for the development of vascular stenosis may help prevent AV graft thrombosis. However, no specific regimen has been proven useful. Results of the various studies have been conflicting due in part to the use of variable treatment regimens and enrollment of differing patient populations. As such, we do <strong>not</strong> prophylactically administer pharmacologic agents (eg, fish oil, anticoagulants, antiplatelet agents) for the purpose of preventing thrombosis in a newly created AV graft in patients who are not considered high risk for AV graft thrombosis (ie, history of thrombosis within three months of surgery of a prior AV access, coagulation abnormality, hypercoagulable state).</p><p>Among the many available antiplatelet agents, predominantly those that block cyclooxygenase (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, sulfinpyrazone), phosphodiesterase inhibitors (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=dipyridamole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dipyridamole</a>) have been studied for reducing AV graft thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-graft-maintenance-and-thrombosis-prevention/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Given the uncertainty concerning the benefit and the increased risk of bleeding, we do not routinely administer antiplatelet therapies to those not considered high risk for thrombosis. (See <a href=\"#H2228109274\" class=\"local\">'Dipyramidole and aspirin'</a> below.)</p><p>Other antiplatelet therapies, including the platelet P2Y12 receptor blockers (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ticlopidine-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ticlopidine</a>), the protease-activated receptor-1 antagonists (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=vorapaxar-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vorapaxar</a>), and the glycoprotein <span class=\"nowrap\">IIb/IIIa</span> receptor blockers, have not been evaluated for this clinical indication. (See <a href=\"#H816534167\" class=\"local\">'Other antiplatelet agents'</a> below.)</p><p>We also do not use prophylactic anticoagulation. Prophylactic anticoagulation does not prevent AV graft thrombosis and is associated with an increased risk of bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-graft-maintenance-and-thrombosis-prevention/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. This was best shown in a multicenter clinical study in which 107 patients with new AV grafts were randomly assigned to receive low-intensity <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> (target international normalized ratio [INR] 1.5 to 1.9) or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-graft-maintenance-and-thrombosis-prevention/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. There was no difference in the rate of AV graft thrombosis between the two groups. However, 10 percent of the patients receiving warfarin developed major hemorrhage despite close monitoring of the INR. Although no well-designed, randomized studies have been performed, some retrospective and observational studies have also reported an increased morbidity and mortality among dialysis patients treated with warfarin for a number of different indications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-hemodialysis-arteriovenous-graft-maintenance-and-thrombosis-prevention/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Anticoagulation may be considered for those with immediate (very early) AV graft thrombosis not related to technical issues. (See <a href=\"#H969096598\" class=\"local\">'Anticoagulation for hypercoagulabity'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1586492959\"><span class=\"h1\">HIGH-RISK AV GRAFTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients at high risk of graft failure are those with a history of thrombosis (within three months of surgery) of a previous arteriovenous (AV) graft.
