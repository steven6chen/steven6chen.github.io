In addition to dementia, distinctive clinical features include: visual hallucinations, parkinsonism, cognitive fluctuations, dysautonomia, sleep disorders, and neuroleptic sensitivity.</p><p>The pathologic hallmark of DLB is the presence of eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusions called Lewy bodies, which contain aggregated alpha-synuclein, in the deep cortical layers throughout the brain, especially in anterior frontal and temporal lobes, cingulate gyrus, and insula.</p><p>There is some clinical imperative to diagnose DLB, as optimal treatment choices - for best efficacy and limitation of significant side effects - are specific to DLB. However, DLB continues to be under recognized, and the clinical diagnostic criteria continue to be refined to improve specificity and sensitivity.</p><p>This topic will describe the clinical and radiologic features and diagnosis of dementia with Lewy bodies. The epidemiology, neuropathology, pathogenesis, prognosis, and treatment of this disorder are discussed separately.

Dementia is essential to the diagnosis of DLB. Other clinical manifestations of DLB are organized into a hierarchy of diagnostic specificity of core and supportive features and biomarkers that provide strong or suggestive evidence for the diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Dementia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dementia, defined as a progressive cognitive decline of sufficient magnitude to interfere with normal social and occupational functions, or with usual daily activities, is an essential feature of DLB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Deficits on tests of attention, executive function, and visuoperceptual ability may be especially prominent and occur early.</p><p>Cognitive dysfunction is often the presenting symptom in DLB. Unlike Alzheimer disease (AD), which typically presents with memory loss as its first and most prominent cognitive deficit, DLB is characterized by early impairments in attention and executive and visuospatial function, with memory affected later in the course of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/3-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-9</a>]. Early symptoms include driving difficulty (eg, getting lost, misjudging distances, or failing to see stop signs or other cars) and impaired job performance.</p><p>Bedside tests of cognitive function, eg, the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) are not reliable to differentiate among dementia types. However, the early appearance of impaired figure copying (overlapping pentagons), clock drawing, and serial sevens (or spelling WORLD backward) is suggestive of DLB, while AD patients generally show impaired short-term memory and orientation as the earliest deficits on the MMSE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. In one study with neuropathologic confirmation, absence of visuospatial impairments in the early stages of disease helped to exclude DLB with a negative predictive value of 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Early signs on neuropsychological testing may include deficiencies in tests of visuospatial and visuoperceptual ability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/5,9,12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,9,12-14</a>]. Measures of executive function and attention (eg, Trail-Making Test, Wisconsin Card-Sorting Test, letter and category verbal fluency tests) may also be impaired early on [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. When memory does become impaired in DLB, memory retrieval may be more affected than acquisition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. DLB patients with prominent AD pathology (eg, neurofibrillary tangles) may have a cognitive profile that is more characteristic of AD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Core clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to dementia, a patient with probable DLB must have at least two &quot;core clinical features&quot; of DLB: cognitive fluctuations, visual hallucinations, rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD), and parkinsonism (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F114309\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114309 \">table 1</a>). These typically appear early and may persist throughout the disease course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Cognitive fluctuations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fluctuations in cognition and levels of alertness may occur early in the course of DLB and are estimated to be a feature in 60 to 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>] of cases. The severity, duration, and type of symptoms involved in fluctuations is quite varied, even for a given patient. Episodes can be subtle, as in a brief decline in ability to perform an activity of daily living, or they may be dramatic enough to raise the question of a stroke or seizure. Caregivers often describe episodes in which patients appear to &quot;blank out&quot; or lose consciousness, become confused or behave in a bizarre manner, have speech or motor arrest, or become excessively somnolent. These episodes can last seconds to days, and they can be interspersed with periods of near-normal function.</p><p>This feature of DLB has been considered the most difficult of the core clinical features for inexperienced clinicians to evaluate. Family members may not volunteer this history. At the same time, questions to elicit this history, if too general, are likely to obtain false positive responses in patients with other forms of dementia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Structured questionnaires (eg, Clinical Assessment of Fluctuation, One Day Fluctuation Assessment Scale) appear to more specifically elicit the symptoms of fluctuations in DLB. These share, as a common feature, the solicitation of more than one example of a fluctuation episode with specific descriptive details regarding symptoms, severity, and duration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Episodes that include at least three of the four following features: daytime drowsiness, daytime naps lasting more than two hours, prolonged staring spells, and episodes of disorganized speech, are more likely to occur in patients with DLB than with AD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Fluctuations in AD are usually described vaguely as &quot;good days and bad days&quot; and are often explained by external stressors. In DLB, fluctuations are more often spontaneous and episodic, seemingly related to an interruption of awareness or attention that impacts functional ability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>An objective measure of fluctuations in DLB using computerized assessments of reaction time and vigilance has been shown to distinguish patients with DLB from vascular dementia and AD, but this is not a generally available clinical assessment tool [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Visual hallucinations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Visual hallucinations occur in approximately two-thirds of patients with DLB, and are relatively rare in AD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. These are also an early sign in DLB and may precede parkinsonism. In one study with neuropathologic confirmation, visual hallucinations at presentation was the most useful clinical feature to distinguish DLB from AD, with 83 percent positive predictive value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Among patients with DLB, those with visual hallucinations appear to have more severe deficits in visual attention and executive function compared with those without visual hallucinations, but similar degrees of visuospatial and visual-perceptual impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Descriptions range from well-formed images of people or animals, to more abstract visions such as shapes or colors. Patients have described such simple hallucinations as seeing something briefly out of the corner of their eye, or extremely complex hallucinations, such as an ongoing dialog with a deceased loved one. Patients may also describe visual misperceptions, in which an object seems to move, zoom toward or away from the patient, or change shape.</p><p>If not specifically solicited, visual hallucinations are often under reported. Patients may or may not have insight into the nature of the hallucinations or illusions, and reactions may vary from fear to indifference to enjoyment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-visual-hallucinations#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with visual hallucinations&quot;, section on 'Neurodegenerative disease'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2636670739\"><span class=\"h3\">REM sleep behavior disorder</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rapid eye movement (REM) sleep behavior disorder (RBD) is a parasomnia characterized by dream enactment behavior that emerges after a loss of REM sleep atonia. Individuals have recurrent sleep-related vocalization <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> complex motor behaviors during REM sleep, correlating with dream mentation. The movements of RBD are short in duration (less than 60 seconds) and appear purposeful, such as throwing a ball or flailing to protect oneself. They range in severity from benign hand gestures to violent thrashing, punching, and kicking. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-eye-movement-sleep-behavior-disorder#H1290521177\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-eye-movement-sleep-behavior-disorder#H1290521184\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Sleep-related injuries can arise from jumping out of bed or striking a bed partner. All patients with RBD and their bed partners should be counseled on ways to alter the sleeping environment to prevent injury. Most patients respond to treatment with melatonin or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonazepam</a>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-eye-movement-sleep-behavior-disorder#H1290521198\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-eye-movement-sleep-behavior-disorder#H1290521108\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>RBD is commonly associated with DLB, occurring in 85 percent of individuals, often early in the course of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. It can precede the clinical diagnosis of DLB by up to 20 years. RBD is not specific to DLB and occurs frequently in patients with Parkinson disease (PD) and other synucleinopathies. It can also be seen in patients with narcolepsy, structural lesions in the brainstem, and as a side effect of certain medications, most notably the selective serotonergic reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) antidepressants. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-eye-movement-sleep-behavior-disorder#H1290521122\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder&quot;, section on 'Etiology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-eye-movement-sleep-behavior-disorder#H1290521108\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Parkinsonism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Parkinsonian symptoms, brady- and akinesia, limb rigidity, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> gait disorder, are seen in approximately 70 to 90 percent of patients with DLB, and they can be as severe as in idiopathic PD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/23,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,28</a>]. However, parkinsonian features are usually more bilaterally symmetric and milder than in PD in most, although not all, studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Tremor may also occur, but it is much less common and less severe than in PD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. Despite these observed clinical trends, no individual symptom characteristic reliably distinguishes the motor parkinsonism of PD versus DLB. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bradykinetic-movement-disorders-in-children#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bradykinetic movement disorders in children&quot;, section on 'Parkinson disease'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Supportive features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>These features include severe sensitivity to antipsychotic drugs, and low dopamine transporter uptake in the basal ganglia on single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or positron-emission tomography (PET) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F114309\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114309 \">table 1</a>). The presence of one of these in combination with one core clinical feature supports the diagnosis of probable DLB. The presence of one or more suggestive features in the absence of a core clinical feature suggests possible DLB.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Antipsychotic sensitivity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 30 to 50 percent of individuals with DLB have severe sensitivity to antipsychotic drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>]. Acute reactions include severe, sometimes irreversible parkinsonism and impaired consciousness, sometimes with other features suggestive of neuroleptic malignant syndrome. This can occur in individuals without baseline parkinsonism.</p><p>Adverse reactions are more common with first-generation antipsychotics (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=haloperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">haloperidol</a>), but reactions to second-generation antipsychotics have also been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=first-generation-antipsychotic-medications-pharmacology-administration-and-comparative-side-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;First-generation antipsychotic medications: Pharmacology, administration, and comparative side effects&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=second-generation-antipsychotic-medications-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Second-generation antipsychotic medications: Pharmacology, administration, and side effects&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The phenomenon is not dose-related. Antipsychotic medications may also precipitate or worsen confusion or autonomic dysfunction, and their use has been associated with a two to three-fold increase in mortality. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-neuropsychiatric-symptoms-of-dementia#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of neuropsychiatric symptoms of dementia&quot;, section on 'Excess mortality'</a>.)</p><p>Severe reactions to antipsychotics are less common in patients with Parkinson disease (with or without dementia), but such reactions have not been described in AD. Despite the high specificity of this finding, deliberate pharmacologic challenge as a diagnostic strategy is obviously unwise. A history of neuroleptic tolerance does not exclude DLB or future antipsychotic sensitivity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Repeated falls</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recurrent falls occur in up to a third of patients with DLB and may be among the earliest symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Falls may seem to occur with or without provocation and may be related to parkinsonism, to cognitive fluctuations, or to orthostatic hypotension.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Syncope or transient loss of consciousness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Episodes of altered or loss of consciousness are commonly described. Patients may transiently lose consciousness, or they may be awake but mute and staring blankly. Episodes may even resemble cataplexy, in which patients develop sudden atonia and fall to the floor.</p><p>These can occur as a result of orthostatic hypotension, which has been reported in 28 to 50 percent of patients, and which can be severe enough to mimic multiple systems atrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. In one series, 6 of 20 patients with DLB followed for three years required medication for blood pressure maintenance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Carotid sinus sensitivity has also been described in association with DLB and may underlie episodes of syncope, or may be a general marker of autonomic dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>Episodes may also represent an extreme cognitive fluctuation or may be analogous to the motor &quot;freezing&quot; seen in idiopathic PD. Other etiologies such as seizures, stroke, transient ischemic attack, or cardiac arrhythmia should also be ruled out.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Autonomic dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to orthostatic hypotension and neurocardiovascular instability discussed above, autonomic dysfunction in DLB may include urinary incontinence or retention, constipation and other gastrointestinal symptoms, and impotence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/37,38,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38,40</a>]. Autonomic symptoms are more prevalent and severe than in PD, but less than in multiple systems atrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Urinary incontinence occurs at late stages of AD when dementia is severe but is often an early sign in DLB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>].</p><p>Some small case series suggest that tests of autonomic dysfunction (eg, sympathetic sweat responses, skin vasomotor reflexes, head-up tilt, ventilatory response to hypercapnia, and heart rate variability) are likely to be markedly abnormal in patients with DLB and may help differentiate these patients from individuals with other neurodegenerative dementias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. However, this diagnostic approach requires independent, prospective validation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2690941234\"><span class=\"h3\">Hypersomnia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypersomnia, also referred to as excessive daytime sleepiness, is common in patients with DLB and may be multifactorial. In addition to RBD, other sleep disorders that may be seen with DLB include insomnia, sleep apnea (obstructive or central), periodic limb movements of sleep, and restless legs <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/Willis</span> Ekbom disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. In one study, daytime sleepiness was confirmed on multiple sleep latency testing in 81 percent of patients with DLB versus 39 percent of patients with AD dementia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2866083846\"><span class=\"h3\">Hyposmia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Decreased olfactory function is common in patients with DLB and other neurodegenerative dementias, including AD and Parkinson disease. Whether poor performance on bedside tests of olfactory function is useful in distinguishing DLB from AD is uncertain, and deficits have been observed in patients with presymptomatic or early stage forms of both diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Hallucinations in other modalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to visual hallucinations, patients with DLB may also experience hallucinations in other modalities. Auditory hallucinations may be well formed, such as hearing identifiable speech or music, or they may be less distinct, such as having the impression of hearing a television, voice, or telephone ringing in another room. Olfactory hallucinations can be pleasant (eg, flowers or food) or unpleasant (eg, burning rubber). Patients have described tactile hallucinations such as the feeling of insects on their skin, or a cat brushing against their leg. The presence of these hallucinations may also prompt a workup for partial seizures, psychotic disorders, or substance intoxication or withdrawal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Systematized delusions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Delusions (false, fixed beliefs) occur commonly in DLB (in as many as 75 percent of cases) and may be elaborate, specific, and systematic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. They are often rooted in hallucinations or visual misperceptions that the patient has experienced. Common themes include: the spouse or caregiver is an impostor, the house is not their home, or people in the television or mirror are speaking to them or following them.</p><p>Somatoform disorder (characterized by a high frequency of medically unexplained symptoms) is a related but distinct psychiatric syndrome that may be observed in patients with DLB. In one study, 12 percent (15 of 124) of patients with DLB exhibited symptoms of somatization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].

Despite the changes in the occipital lobe on functional imaging discussed below, regional occipital atrophy is generally not observed on MRI in DLB. However, one study did report that a finding of reduced fractional anisotropy in the parieto-occipital white matter tracts on diffusion tensor imaging was associated with DLB and not AD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">SPECT and PET studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with DLB, single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) and positron emission tomography (PET) scans show generalized decreased perfusion and metabolism, respectively; the deficits are most marked in the occipital areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/60-66\" class=\"abstract_t\">60-66</a>].

The clinical features which are useful in distinguishing among these disorders are discussed above.

In PDD, dementia occurs in the setting of well-established parkinsonism, while in DLB, dementia usually occurs concomitantly with or before the development of parkinsonian signs. If parkinsonism is present for more than one year before the onset of dementia, it is officially classified as PDD. This arbitrary &quot;one-year rule&quot; may be an artificial distinction; the length of time that parkinsonism precedes other symptoms in otherwise similar patients does not correlate with pathologic differences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. On the other hand, in one quantitative morphometric MRI study, patients with DLB had more pronounced cortical atrophy compared with patients with PDD, despite a similar severity of dementia in both groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Another study also found that patients with PDD and DLB with similar severities of dementia could be distinguished by patterns of fractional anisotropy on diffuse tensor imaging MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. In contrast, a positron emission tomography study using dopaminergic and cholinergic tracers found that PDD and DLB appeared similar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>].</p><p>Other features that may help distinguish between DLB and PDD are an older age of onset, faster clinical decline, and decreased levodopa responsivity for DLB compared with PDD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>].

Parkinson disease dementia is discussed separately.

Fluctuations in a demented individual may be due to transient ischemic attack, seizure, or cardiac arrhythmia, rather than as a manifestation of DLB. Similarly, extrapyramidal side effects of medications should be considered as a potential cause of parkinsonism in patients with dementia. There is substantial clinical as well as pathologic overlap between AD and DLB. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathology, and pathogenesis of dementia with Lewy bodies&quot;, section on 'Clinical pathologic correlations'</a>.)</p><p>Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) and DLB can have similar presentations.

Treatable conditions are excluded. In general, this evaluation includes a cognitive assessment (Mini-Mental State Examination or formal neuropsychological testing), a neuroimaging study (usually magnetic resonance imaging), and laboratory evaluations (vitamin B12 level and thyroid function tests). This topic is discussed in more detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-cognitive-impairment-and-dementia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of cognitive impairment and dementia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other ancillary studies are not routinely indicated but may be needed depending on the clinical picture. Electroencephalography (EEG) may be helpful if there is a question of seizures or of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD). In DLB, the tracing may appear normal or nonspecifically abnormal with diffuse slowing, disorganization of the background rhythm, and temporal lobe transient sharp waves; frontal intermittent rhythmic delta activity (FIRDA) has also been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-dementia-with-lewy-bodies/abstract/88,93\" class=\"abstract_t\">88,93</a>]. Video-monitored electroencephalogram (EEG) may be useful to rule out seizures in the evaluation of cognitive fluctuations or staring spells. Polysomnography may be useful in evaluating sleep disorders. Other tests to evaluate the possibility of transient ischemic attack or syncope may be indicated in some patients with severe fluctuations or episodic loss of consciousness.
