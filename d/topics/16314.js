Typically, it is suspected when patients present with signs or symptoms of SBP. It may also be detected in patients who are asymptomatic who undergo paracentesis when admitted to the hospital for another reason. The diagnosis of SBP is established by a positive ascitic fluid bacterial culture, an elevated ascitic fluid absolute polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) count (&ge;250 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/mm<sup>3</sup>),</span> and exclusion of secondary causes of bacterial peritonitis. </p><p>An elevated ascitic fluid absolute PMN count (&ge;250 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/mm<sup>3</sup>)</span> is adequate to make a presumptive diagnosis of SBP and to start empiric therapy. Too often, the paracentesis is performed after antibiotics are initiated <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> inadequate culture technique is used. In these situations, the cultures are regularly negative. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in adults: Diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic will review the clinical manifestations of SBP. The pathogenesis of SBP, the diagnosis of SBP, differentiating SBP from a surgically-treatable cause of secondary bacterial peritonitis (eg, a perforated viscus), and the treatment and prophylaxis of SBP are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in adults: Diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-variants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis variants&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-treatment-and-prophylaxis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in adults: Treatment and prophylaxis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H236338055\"><span class=\"h1\">IMPORTANCE OF EARLY RECOGNITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important to recognize spontaneous bacterial peritonitis early in the course of infection because there is frequently a very short window of opportunity during which to intervene to ensure a good outcome. If the opportunity is missed, shock ensues, followed rapidly by multisystem organ failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Survival is unlikely in patients who develop shock prior to initiation of empiric antibiotics. One report estimated that survival decreased by approximately 8 percent for each hour of delay in starting antibiotics in patients with septic shock [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Another study has shown that delayed paracentesis in patients with SBP leads to a 2.7 fold increase risk of death; each hour of delay in paracentesis is associated with a 3.3 percent increase in in-hospital mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-treatment-and-prophylaxis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in adults: Treatment and prophylaxis&quot;, section on 'Indications for antibiotic therapy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H236338005\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL SETTING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) typically have advanced cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The higher the Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score, the higher the risk of SBP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Spontaneous infection of noncirrhotic ascites (eg, ascites due to malignancy or heart failure) is unusual enough to be the subject of case reports and small series. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients almost always develop SBP in the setting of large-volume, clinically-obvious ascites. Out of more than 1000 patients, we have only encountered two patients who developed SBP in clinically undetectable ascites, both of whom were children. SBP develops in preexisting ascites and is not a cause of ascites. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) should be suspected in patients with ascites due to advanced cirrhosis who develop symptoms such as fever, abdominal <span class=\"nowrap\">pain/tenderness,</span> and altered mental status (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F71038\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71038 \">table 1</a>). Other signs and symptoms of SBP include diarrhea, paralytic ileus, hypotension, hypothermia, and laboratory abnormalities, such as a peripheral leukocytosis, metabolic acidosis, and azotemia. The signs and symptoms of SBP are subtle compared with those seen in patients with bacterial peritonitis in the absence of ascites. By separating the visceral from the parietal peritoneal surfaces, ascites prevents the development of a rigid abdomen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Approximately 13 percent of patients with SBP have no signs or symptoms of infection at the time of diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>With time, the number of patients diagnosed prior to developing symptoms has increased. In the 1960s and 1970s, the index of suspicion of ascitic fluid infection was low, and the threshold for performing a paracentesis was high. As a result, infection was detected at an advanced stage in which shock was common and mortality was high [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Currently, patients with ascites undergo paracentesis upon admission to the hospital or if any signs or symptoms of infection are present, leading to detection of SBP earlier than was seen in the past (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F64189\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64189 \">table 2</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Fever</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fever is the most common clinical manifestation of SBP. It is important to appreciate that patients with advanced cirrhosis are usually mildly hypothermic. Thus, a temperature of 37.8&ordm;C (100&ordm;F) or greater must be taken seriously, similar to the situation in the patient with neutropenia. </p><p>We give written instructions for patients to call our office if their temperature rises to this level. If the patient has a clear-cut viral syndrome, the problem may be handled over the telephone. Otherwise, evaluation in the clinic, urgent care, or emergency department is warranted. Paracentesis, urinalysis, complete blood count, and bacterial culture of ascitic fluid, urine, and blood are obtained. If the patient looks ill, hospitalization is required. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in adults: Diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Abdominal pain and tenderness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diffuse abdominal pain is the hallmark of peritonitis. However, the pain can be very subtle in SBP due to the presence of ascites, and some patients are asymptomatic. The pain is usually diffuse and continuous; it is different from the pain induced by stretching of the abdominal wall due to tense ascites.</p><p>As with abdominal pain, abdominal tenderness is a classic sign of peritonitis that can be subtle in SBP. These patients do not develop a rigid abdomen, although rebound tenderness may be present in advanced cases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Altered mental status</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical sign of infection that is frequently overlooked in the patient with cirrhosis is a subtle change in mental status. While the patient may present with frank delirium, confusion, or cognitive slowing, the alteration in mental status may be so subtle that it can only be detected by a spouse or a clinician who knows the patient well. Altered mental status is seen in approximately half of patients with SBP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Both the infection itself and hepatic decompensation may contribute to this problem. Ammonia levels do not correlate well with mental status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The Reitan trail test is helpful in detecting subtle changes in mental status in patients with cirrhosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F83108\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83108 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F83109\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83109 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. It is a timed connect-the-numbers test. Patients without hepatic encephalopathy should finish the test in a number of seconds less than or equal to their age in years. In other words, if a patient is 50 years old, he should be able to finish the test in &le;50 seconds. If he cannot, he probably has hepatic encephalopathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatic-encephalopathy-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatic encephalopathy in adults: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Psychometric tests'</a>.)</p><p>The test can be administered in the clinic or on the ward by a clinician, nurse, or assistant. It is more helpful, cheaper, and more rapidly available than a plasma ammonia concentration. The key is having a copy of the test on hand. The test traditionally has two parts, though we only use the first (part A) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F83108\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83108 \">figure 1</a>), since in our experience, the second part can be confusing and does not add important clinical information.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Diarrhea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diarrhea is common in patients with SBP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. An alteration in gut flora with overgrowth of one organism (usually Escherichia coli) has been documented in an animal model of cirrhosis and SBP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. These animals regularly develop diarrhea as this occurs, followed by extraintestinal dissemination of the pathogen, which may herald the onset of ascitic fluid infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Paralytic ileus, hypotension, hypothermia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>These more severe signs are indicative of advanced infection and a poor likelihood of survival. It is important to detect infection and begin antibiotic treatment before this stage is reached. (See <a href=\"#H236338055\" class=\"local\">'Importance of early recognition'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Occasionally, an infected patient with cirrhosis will have no clinical signs or symptoms, but will have subtle laboratory signs of infection. These include leukocytosis, metabolic acidosis, and azotemia. The otherwise unexplained presence of one or more of these abnormalities should prompt abdominal paracentesis in a patient with cirrhosis and ascites.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1561989909\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
