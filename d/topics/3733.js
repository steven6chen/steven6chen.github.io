Initially, patients present with exertional dyspnea and fatigue. Because PH is progressive, the presentation evolves over time so that patients may eventually develop the signs and symptoms of severe pulmonary hypertension with overt right ventricular failure (eg, exertional chest pain or syncope and congestion including peripheral edema, ascites, and pleural effusion). The diagnosis is often delayed because the presenting features of PH are frequently attributed incorrectly to age, deconditioning, or a coexisting or alternate medical condition. As a result, PH is often not suspected until symptoms become severe or serious. It has been estimated that more than 20 percent of patients have symptoms of PH for longer than two years before it is recognized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

These include exertional dyspnea, lethargy, and fatigue. Additional symptoms emerge as the PH progresses and right ventricular hypertrophy and failure develop.

Auscultation may reveal a holosystolic murmur of tricuspid regurgitation and, occasionally,<strong> </strong>systolic ejection murmur and, in more severe disease, a diastolic pulmonic regurgitation murmur. These right-sided murmurs and gallops are augmented with inspiration. The systemic venous hypertension caused by right ventricular failure can lead to a variety of findings, such as elevated jugular venous pressure, a right ventricular third heart sound, and a prominent V wave in the jugular venous pulse. Hepatomegaly, a pulsatile liver, peripheral edema, ascites, and pleural effusion may also exist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. </p><p/><p>Some patients with PH due to severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) develop edema even in the absence of right heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

The purpose of the diagnostic testing is to confirm that PH exists, determine its severity, and identify its cause (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F72553\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef72553 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Our approach is described below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H93906894\"><span class=\"h2\">Our approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest beginning the evaluation with an echocardiogram [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Echocardiography'</a> below.)</p><p>When the echocardiogram does not suggest PH, clinicians need to be guided by clinical suspicion. The diagnostic evaluation should be directed toward alternative diagnoses if the clinical suspicion for PH is low, whereas right heart catheterization should be considered if the clinical suspicion for PH is still high.</p><p>When the echocardiogram is suggestive of PH, clinicians should determine whether or not there is enough left heart disease on the echocardiogram to explain the degree of estimated PH:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with enough left heart disease on the echocardiogram to explain the degree of estimated PH do not require further testing to determine the etiology of PH. This may be more obvious in patients with severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction or severe mitral or aortic valve disease. It may be less obvious in patients with diastolic dysfunction or diastolic heart failure (heart failure with preserved ejection fraction). If there is uncertainty, right and left heart catheterization may be helpful. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Right heart catheterization'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-catheterization-techniques-normal-hemodynamics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac catheterization techniques: Normal hemodynamics&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who have no left heart disease, left heart disease that seems insufficient to explain the degree of estimated PH, or a potential second etiology, should undergo additional diagnostic testing to look for an alternative cause of the PH. The testing may include pulmonary function testing, ventilation-perfusion scanning, overnight oximetry, polysomnography, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> laboratory testing (eg, autoimmune serologies, HIV serology, and liver function tests). The sequence of testing should be prioritized according to the history and physical examination. As an example, pulmonary function testing is an appropriate initial test in a heavy smoker. (See <a href=\"#H17914522\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic tests'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients in whom chronic lung disease is suspected, right heart catheterization is usually reserved for those in whom the severity of PH on echocardiogram is not explained by the severity of their underlying lung disease or for those in whom an alternate etiology is suspected. When pulmonary dysfunction is severe enough to explain the degree of PH on echocardiogram, right heart catheterization is not indicated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Right heart catheterization is indicated to confirm the PH and assess its severity, although this is often done at the time that therapy is initiated. Exercise testing may be performed as well, to determine the functional severity of disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F62080\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62080 \">table 1</a>).

Right ventricular enlargement (diminished retrosternal space) and right atrial dilatation (prominent right heart border) may also be seen. Occasionally, the underlying cause of the PH is apparent on the chest radiograph (eg, interstitial lung disease).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Electrocardiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The electrocardiogram (ECG) of a patient with PH may demonstrate signs of right ventricular hypertrophy or strain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F67622\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef67622 \">waveform 1</a>), including right axis deviation, an R <span class=\"nowrap\">wave/S</span> wave ratio greater than one in lead V1, incomplete or complete right bundle branch block, or increased P wave amplitude in lead II (P pulmonale) due to right atrial enlargement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F63181\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63181 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F64928\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef64928 \">waveform 2</a>). Most ECG signs are specific but not sensitive for the detection of right ventricular disease. ECG changes do not correlate with disease severity or prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Echocardiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Echocardiography is performed to estimate the pulmonary artery systolic pressure and to assess right ventricular size, thickness, and function (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F80275\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef80275 \">image 3</a>). In addition, echocardiography can evaluate right atrial size, left ventricular systolic and diastolic function, and valve function, while detecting pericardial effusions and intracardiac shunts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F80448\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef80448 \">movie 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57251\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef57251 \">movie 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. The echocardiographic findings of PH are summarized in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F77640\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77640 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1175195\"><span class=\"h4\">Estimating pulmonary artery pressure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Echocardiography uses Doppler ultrasound to estimate the pulmonary artery systolic pressure. This technique takes advantage of the tricuspid regurgitation that usually exists. The maximum tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity is recorded and the pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) is then calculated:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160;PASP = (4 x [TRV]<sup>2</sup>) + RAP</p></div></div><p>where TRV is the maximum tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity and RAP is the right atrial pressure estimated from the size and respiratory variation of flow in the inferior vena cava. Doppler echocardiography is limited when an adequate tricuspid regurgitant jet cannot be identified. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-doppler-echocardiography\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of Doppler echocardiography&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with PH may have echocardiographic signs of right ventricular pressure overload, including systolic flattening of the interventricular septum and hypertrophy of the right ventricular free wall and trabeculae (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F71065\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef71065 \">image 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F67911\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef67911 \">movie 3</a>). As the right ventricle fails, there is dilation and hypokinesis, flattening and reverse curvature of the interventricular septum (ie, bulging into the left ventricle), right atrial dilation, and tricuspid regurgitation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F55501\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef55501 \">movie 4</a>). The tricuspid regurgitation is not due to an intrinsic abnormality of the tricuspid valve; it is a secondary manifestation of dilation of the tricuspid annulus and right ventricle (ie, functional tricuspid regurgitation) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F80498\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef80498 \">movie 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F68814\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef68814 \">movie 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Other findings associated with pulmonary hypertension are pulmonic insufficiency and midsystolic closure of the pulmonic valve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p>Based upon a Doppler echocardiographic study, it can be determined if PH is likely, unlikely, or possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PH is likely if the PASP is &gt;50 and the TRV is &gt;3.4</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PH is unlikely if the PASP is &le;36, the TRV is &le;2.8, and there are no other suggestive findings</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PH is possible with other combinations of findings</p><p/><p>Doppler echocardiography may be misleading in the assessment of patients with suspected PH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>], especially when an inadequate tricuspid regurgitant jet is over interpreted. This was illustrated by an observational study of 65 patients with various types of PH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The pulmonary arterial pressure estimated by Doppler echocardiography was at least 10 mmHg higher or lower than that obtained by right heart catheterization (RHC) in 48 percent of patients and, in many cases, the difference in pulmonary artery pressure determined by the two modalities was significantly greater than 10 mmHg. Overestimation and underestimation of pulmonary arterial pressure occurred with similar frequency, although the magnitude of the underestimation was greater. </p><p>Both echocardiography and RHC are subject to disagreement when performed at different times (eg, days or weeks apart) and under different medical conditions (eg, awake versus sedated), which is a major limitation of the studies that compare their accuracy in the diagnosis of PH. Nonetheless, while echocardiography detects PH with greater accuracy than clinical history and examination, its greatest value is the detection of underlying left-sided heart disease as well as assessing right ventricular function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. </p><p>In our practice, we consider echocardiography and invasive hemodynamic assessment (RHC and a left ventricular end-diastolic pressure [LVEDP]) to be complementary studies in the assessment of patients with PH. Importantly, neither RHC nor echocardiography should overemphasize the pulmonary artery pressure in the initial assessment of patients with PH or the follow-up assessment of patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) on advanced therapeutics. Right atrial pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance, left ventricular filling pressure (pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and LVEDP), cardiac output, right ventricular size and function, the magnitude of tricuspid regurgitation, left atrial size and the presence or absence of a pericardial effusion are <strong>all</strong> important when assessing patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">PH/PAH</span>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1175207\"><span class=\"h4\">Distinguishing group 2 pulmonary hypertension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While poorly studied, most experts agree that assessment of left atrial (LA) size is appropriate in patients with suspected PH. The demonstration of a dilated LA is indicative of chronically elevated LA pressure, thereby supporting PH due to left-sided cardiac disease (ie, group 2 PH). As an example, in one study, a medical history of left-sided heart disease and evidence of moderate LA dilation or left valvular disease on echocardiography were independent predictors of left-sided heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Pulmonary function tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) are performed to identify and characterize underlying lung disease that may be contributing to PH. An obstructive pattern is suggestive of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), while restrictive disease suggests interstitial lung disease, neuromuscular weakness, or chest wall disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-pulmonary-function-testing-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of pulmonary function testing in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It is usually severe interstitial lung disease (with lung volumes below 50 percent of predicted) or obstructive lung disease that produces PH. In most circumstances, PH should not be attributed to lung disease if the PFTs are only mildly abnormal since PH itself can cause PFT abnormalities. As an example, a study of 79 patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) demonstrated that more than half of patients had a mild to moderate decrease of forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) or forced vital capacity (FVC) compared to age and sex matched controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) is usually decreased in PH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Overnight oximetry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nocturnal oxyhemoglobin desaturation can be identified by overnight oximetry.
