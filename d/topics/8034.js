The rash can look like a cluster of tiny bubbles under the skin or like a cluster of small pimples (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F86259\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86259 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p>Anyone can get a heat rash, but it is most common in young children. The rash most often shows up on the head, neck, chest, or anywhere where the skin rubs together (like the armpit).</p><p>Heat rash is sometimes called prickly heat. Doctors and nurses call it &quot;miliaria crystallina&quot; or &quot;miliaria rubra.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H504077934\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to get rid of a heat rash?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. The most important thing you can do is try to reduce how much you are sweating. If possible, stay in a cool, dry place. You can take cool baths or use a clean cloth dipped in cold water to cool the areas with the rash. Also be sure to wear loose clothes that let your skin breathe.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H504077949\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Heat rash does not usually call for a doctor's visit.
