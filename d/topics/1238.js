These survivors are experiencing the normal issues of aging, which may be compounded by the long-term effects of having had cancer and cancer therapy. Long-term survivors are at risk for a CRC recurrence (which is less common after the first five years following treatment), a new primary CRC, other cancers, and both short-term and long-term adverse effects of treatment. Additional issues for cancer survivors relate to psychological, reproductive, genetic, social, and employment concerns. </p><p>This topic review will provide an overview of the approach to the long-term adult survivor of CRC during the phase of care that follows the completion of active treatment. A general overview of cancer survivorship and a more detailed discussion of post-treatment surveillance for colorectal cancer recurrence following treatment is presented elsewhere.

The National Coalition for Cancer Survivorship [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-long-term-survivor-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>] and the National Cancer Institute define a person as a cancer survivor from the moment of a cancer diagnosis, through the balance of his or her life. Others have defined phases or &quot;seasons&quot; of survival in cancer patients, including the acute stage (diagnosis and treatment), extended stage (remission <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> maintenance, with a main focus on surveillance for disease recurrence), and permanent stage (long-term survival or &quot;cure,&quot; with a focus on long-term risks of treatment and prevention of subsequent diseases) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-long-term-survivor-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. For the purpose of this overview, we define a CRC survivor as an individual who has completed treatment (ie, surgery, chemotherapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiation therapy) and who is without evidence of disease. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H617978414\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY OF CRC SURVIVORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States, the lifetime incidence of CRC is approximately 4.2 to 4.6 percent (approximately 1 in 22 to 24) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-long-term-survivor-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].

More than 90 percent of invasive CRCs are diagnosed in patients older than 50 years, with more than two-thirds diagnosed in patients older than 65 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-long-term-survivor-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].<strong> </strong>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colorectal-cancer-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-protective-factors#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Colorectal cancer: Epidemiology, risk factors, and protective factors&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>Death rates from CRC have declined progressively since the mid-1980s in the United States and in many other Western countries. This improvement in outcome has been attributed, at least in part, to early detection and removal of colonic polyps (which are a precursor to invasive cancer), diagnosis of CRCs at an earlier stage, and more effective treatments, particularly adjuvant therapy.

Of the 11.7 million cancer survivors living in the United States as of January 2007, 1.11 million, or 9.5 percent, were CRC survivors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-long-term-survivor-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p>Cancer is largely a disease of older persons, and the majority of CRC survivors in the United States (approximately 60 percent) are over the age of 65 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-long-term-survivor-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. As a result, CRC survivorship often occurs in a background of comorbid illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-long-term-survivor-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17400954\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT, PROGNOSIS, AND NATURAL HISTORY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15753839\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview of treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among newly diagnosed CRCs in the United States, approximately 39 percent of cases are localized at diagnosis, and an additional 37 percent are locoregional (node-positive) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-long-term-survivor-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

In addition, a minority of the 20 percent of patients who present with metastatic disease may be eligible for curative-intent surgery; this is most likely in those with a limited number of isolated liver or lung metastases.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-primary-colon-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of primary colon cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Following curative intent surgery, six months of adjuvant chemotherapy is a standard approach for patients with node-positive (stage III, (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111438\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111438 \">table 1</a>)) colon cancer. The intent of adjuvant chemotherapy is eradication of micrometastases, which decreases disease recurrence and increases cure rates. An oxaliplatin-containing regimen provides a greater degree of benefit than does a fluoropyrimidine-only regimen, at least in non-elderly patients, and this has become a standard approach. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-therapy-for-resected-stage-iii-node-positive-colon-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant therapy for resected stage III (node-positive) colon cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-therapy-for-resected-colon-cancer-in-elderly-patients#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant therapy for resected colon cancer in elderly patients&quot;, section on 'Oxaliplatin-based regimens'</a>.)</p><p>The benefits of adjuvant chemotherapy are less certain for patients with node-negative (stage II) tumors. Nevertheless, it is often recommended to patients with higher-risk stage II disease (inadequately sampled lymph nodes, T4 primary lesion, tumor perforation, lymphovascular or perineural invasion, poorly differentiated histology) despite the lack of direct data from randomized controlled trials to support benefit for adjuvant chemotherapy in this high-risk subset. In this setting, a fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy regimen is usually chosen, although patients with higher-risk stage II disease may be offered an oxaliplatin-based regimen. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-chemotherapy-for-resected-stage-ii-colon-cancer#H589530408\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant chemotherapy for resected stage II colon cancer&quot;, section on 'Clinicopathologic variables'</a>.)</p><p>The role of adjuvant RT in patients with resected colon cancer is poorly defined. Nevertheless, current guidelines suggest that adjuvant RT be offered to the following subgroups of patients who have an estimated risk of local recurrence that is 30 percent or higher: T4 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111438\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111438 \">table 1</a>) primary of the ascending or descending colon, or a positive resection margin.

As a result, the combination of postoperative chemotherapy and radiation therapy (which is typically administered concomitantly with chemotherapy as a radiosensitizer) is a standard approach after resection of node-positive rectal cancer, and in most cases, after resection of transmural node negative (T3-4, N0) tumor. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-therapy-for-resected-rectal-adenocarcinoma#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant therapy for resected rectal adenocarcinoma&quot;, section on 'Combined modality therapy'</a>.)</p><p>Combined modality therapy may be administered preoperatively (neoadjuvant therapy). This approach results in a more favorable long-term toxicity profile and better local control. Upfront chemoradiotherapy may also enhance the ability to perform sphincter preservation in some patients with low-lying rectal cancers. Indications for neoadjuvant therapy in patients with rectal cancer are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neoadjuvant-chemoradiotherapy-and-radiotherapy-for-rectal-adenocarcinoma#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and radiotherapy for rectal adenocarcinoma&quot;, section on 'Indications for neoadjuvant treatment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15750451\"><span class=\"h3\">Prognosis and natural history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Five-year survival rates for all stages of colon and rectal cancer are 65 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-long-term-survivor-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Disease stage is the most important prognostic factor. As an example, five-year survival rates for colon cancer, stratified by stage, in data collected from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database between 1991 and 2000 were as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-long-term-survivor-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-primary-colon-cancer#H35\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of primary colon cancer&quot;, section on 'Prognosis'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage I (T1-2N0) &ndash; 93 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage IIA (T3N0) &ndash; 85 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage IIB (T4N0) &ndash; 72 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage IIIA (T1-2 N1) &ndash; 83 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage IIIB (T3-4 N1) &ndash; 64 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage IIIC (N2) &ndash; 44 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage IV &ndash; 8 percent</p><p/><p>Five-year overall survival rates, stratified according to 2010 American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) tumor stage at diagnosis for rectal cancer and derived from the SEER database, are illustrated in the following figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F60598\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60598 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-long-term-survivor-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, these outcome estimates are problematic in two ways:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The survival rates depict overall and not cancer-specific survival. Because the incidence of colorectal cancer increases with age, there are relevant risks of dying from causes other than colorectal cancer. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Furthermore, in the case of rectal cancer, these survival estimates were derived from studies in which surgical resection was not preceded by neoadjuvant therapy. Outcomes may be better in patients who undergo pathologic staging after preoperative treatment. </p><p/><p>These two issues were addressed in a series of 771 consecutive patients with stages I to IV rectal cancer who were undergoing resection between 1991 and 2008; 296 (38 percent) received some form of neoadjuvant therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-long-term-survivor-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Ten-year cancer-specific survival rates for patients with stage I II, III, and IV disease at the time of resection were 89, 80, 63, and 11 percent, respectively. Only approximately one-third of the observed deaths in patients with stages I to III disease were related to rectal cancer. In addition, a substantial number of deaths due to rectal cancer occurred between years 5 and 10 (5-year and 10-year cancer specific survival 73 versus 66 percent), highlighting the importance of longer follow-up periods to avoid underestimating the real burden of rectal cancer.

An ostomy has pervasive effects on everyday life (wearing an ostomy bag underneath one's clothing, the possibility of repeated skin irritations and other complications, difficulties with diet selection and bowel control, as well as reduced social, emotional, sexual, and occupational functioning) that combine to reduce overall functioning and QOL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-long-term-survivor-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>].

In an analysis derived from the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database, 72,408 individuals over the age of 65 diagnosed and treated for stage I to III CRC between 2000 and 2011 (27 percent of whom received some form of adjuvant chemotherapy, and 12 percent RT) were compared with a matched cohort of 72,408 Medicare patients without cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-long-term-survivor-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. At a median follow-up of eight years, the 10-year cumulative incidence of new-onset CVD and heart failure were significantly higher in patients treated for CRC (57 and 55 percent compared with 22 and 18 percent for control, respectively). Risk increased with age, and was influenced by exposure to fluoropyrimidines and pre-existing comorbidities.

Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer [HNPCC]) are the most common of the familial CRC syndromes, but together these two conditions account for only about 5 percent of CRC cases.

The term Lynch syndrome denotes families who have been genetically determined to have a disease-causing defect in one of the mismatch repair (MMR) genes. The biologic footprint of a defect in MMR capacity is high levels of microsatellite instability (MSI). MSI testing of CRCs is routinely used to help establish the diagnosis of Lynch syndrome. Some institutions perform MSI testing or immunohistochemistry (IHC) testing for MMR proteins in CRCs in young patients (diagnosed prior to age 50 years) or in those who meet the Bethesda criteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F72965\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72965 \">table 5</a>).

Other sites at increased risk of neoplasm formation include the ovary, stomach, small bowel, hepatobiliary system, brain, and renal pelvis or ureter. </p><p>The development of one or more of these cancers in a family member of a CRC survivor may prompt consideration for genetic testing. Family history is seldom updated regularly during follow-up. However, regularly updating a three-generation family history pedigree from cancer survivors can be valuable to help determine the potential risk for cancer in family members, as well as the survivor's own risk of subsequent cancers that may be associated with a previously unrecognized hereditary syndrome. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H617978491\"><span class=\"h1\">LIFESTYLE MODIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The role of lifestyle modification (eg, diet, exercise, smoking cessation) and the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/nonsteroidal</span> inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in preventing a cancer recurrence is often a topic of interest to cancer survivors.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-cancer-survivorship-care-for-primary-care-and-oncology-providers#H418030689\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of cancer survivorship care for primary care and oncology providers&quot;, section on 'Coordination of care'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1357321703\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Care for CRC survivors includes surveillance for recurrent or second cancers, encouragement of healthy lifestyles that minimize cancer risk, treatment of psychosocial and medical consequences of cancer and its therapy, management of comorbid disease in this generally older population, and coordination of care between specialists and primary care providers. (See <a href=\"#H2563742\" class=\"local\">'Approach to cancer survivorship'</a> above.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment for CRC depends on stage and tumor location. For patients with local or locoregional (node-positive, stage III (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111438\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111438 \">table 1</a>)) colon or rectal cancer, surgical resection is a prerequisite for cure. Adjuvant chemotherapy following curative-intent surgery is a standard approach for patients with stage III (node-positive) colon cancer and may be recommended to patients with higher-risk stage II disease. Postoperative (or preoperative) chemotherapy and chemoradiotherapy is a standard approach following resection for T3N0 or node-positive rectal cancer. (See <a href=\"#H15754038\" class=\"local\">'Colon cancer'</a> above and <a href=\"#H15754045\" class=\"local\">'Rectal cancer'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The majority of CRC recurrences occur within the first five years after diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H15750451\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis and natural history'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Guidelines for disease surveillance during the first five years post-treatment from several expert groups, including the American Society of Clinical Oncology and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network are outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F91618\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91618 \">table 3</a>). Patients with stage I disease have a favorable prognosis (five-year survival of 93 percent), and surveillance recommendations are limited to periodic colonoscopy and clinician visits. (See <a href=\"#H15754630\" class=\"local\">'Guidelines from expert groups'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Specific recommendations for follow-up of CRC survivors are available from the American Cancer Society [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-long-term-survivor-of-colorectal-cancer/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>] and the <a href=\"https://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/f_guidelines.asp&amp;token=Uq9WYRsg9p/PSM9vt3rBGtHa7uSejixwk2tJVlS5LMeu0awaX/Er3fekhDozpt3zew+Yt0LRtO7qp5BoCEEM5YoFu3K3VNa+mIo9yk7LJGM=&amp;TOPIC_ID=14230\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)</a>.<br/><br/>In keeping with these guidelines, CRC survivors should be regularly screened for psychosocial distress, including depression and employment issues, often associated with survivorship. Other common medical issues in CRC survivors include bowel problems and fatigue. CRC survivors may also be at higher risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Urinary incontinence and sexual dysfunction are more common in survivors of rectal cancer. (See <a href=\"#H617978421\" class=\"local\">'Psychosocial issues'</a> above and <a href=\"#H617978428\" class=\"local\">'Medical issues'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chemotherapies that are commonly used in the setting of nonmetastatic CRC include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capecitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capecitabine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxaliplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxaliplatin</a>. The most common long-term effect of chemotherapy is oxaliplatin-induced peripheral neuropathy; the 1 percent of patients with chronic severe painful neuropathy may require treatment with opioids, antidepressants, or anticonvulsants. Complications of radiation therapy include radiation proctitis and increased risk for pelvic fracture. (See <a href=\"#H23972007\" class=\"local\">'Complications due to radiation therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H551618114\" class=\"local\">'Side effects related to chemotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All CRC cancer survivors should be encouraged to pursue a healthy lifestyle that includes following a prudent diet and avoiding weight gain, pursuing an active exercise program, minimizing alcohol intake, and refraining from smoking. Observational studies suggest that use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and other nonsteroidal inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may improve survival among patients receiving treatment for early colon cancer. However, prospective confirmation of the benefit of aspirin in a randomized trial is needed before routine use of aspirin can be recommended to CRC survivors, given the potential for harm (eg, gastrointestinal bleeding). (See <a href=\"#H617978491\" class=\"local\">'Lifestyle modification'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A variety of clinicians may follow patients after the primary therapy of CRC, provided they are experienced in the surveillance of these patients and the complications that may arise from treatment. A shared care model that integrates both specialists and primary care providers in ongoing follow-up care may provide the best adherence to guidelines for recommended preventive and chronic disease care.
