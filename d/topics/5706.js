A review of the common pacing system problems of dual chamber pacemakers and the methods of evaluation and therapy are reviewed here. The malfunctions presented will be limited to those that are manifest on the electrocardiogram. Other complications, such as infections, venous thrombosis and emboli, pacemaker syndrome, and tricuspid regurgitation are discussed elsewhere.

Either component may be the source of a clinical malfunction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=permanent-cardiac-pacing-overview-of-devices-and-indications#H403204731\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Permanent cardiac pacing: Overview of devices and indications&quot;, section on 'Types of permanent pacemaker systems'</a>.)</p><p>The phrase &quot;pacing system malfunction&quot; includes problems that might arise from any of the components of the system. Inappropriately programmed pacemaker parameters, although not representing abnormal pacing system function, may yield suboptimal results for the patient. The normal characteristics and unique timing systems and algorithms of a given pacemaker should be examined, as they may be interpreted as malfunction by a clinician who is unfamiliar with the specific pulse generator. Recording system artifacts must always be considered in the differential diagnosis of a pacing system malfunction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DUAL CHAMBER PACING MODES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A pacemaker programmed to the DDD mode is capable of pacing and sensing in both the right atrium and right ventricle. Virtually all of the dual-chamber rate-modulated pacing systems can also be programmed to any of the available modes, including DDI, DVI, VDD, and all of the single-chamber modes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F79459\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79459 \">table 1</a>). A review of the normal pacing modes is presented in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modes-of-cardiac-pacing-nomenclature-and-selection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Modes of cardiac pacing: Nomenclature and selection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">LIMITING THE MAXIMAL PACED RATE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In dual chamber pacing systems that are capable of tracking P waves, there is a programmable limit placed upon the maximum paced ventricular rate that can occur in response to sensed atrial activity. This is essential because, if there was no limit, the pacemaker could potentially track atrial flutter at the rate of the flutter waves or track atrial fibrillation resulting in a rapid ventricular response. In addition, there may be clinical and physiologic reasons to limit the fastest rate of the pacing system, such as active ischemic heart disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Total atrial refractory period</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The total atrial refractory period (TARP) is comprised of the AV interval, during which the atrial sensing circuit is refractory and the post ventricular atrial refractory period (PVARP). The PVARP is a second refractory period that is initiated on the atrial channel by a sensed or paced ventricular event. With early generation dual-chamber unipolar pacing systems, far-field oversensing was relatively common. To prevent this, paced events in one chamber initiated periods of refractoriness in the opposite channel of the pacemaker. In addition, a ventricular depolarization could potentially be sensed in the atrium and, thus, when an R wave is sensed in the ventricle, the PVARP is initiated.</p><p>When the interval between successive native atrial complexes is shorter than the TARP, some P waves will not be sensed. Since the pacemaker can only track those atrial depolarizations that are sensed, as the intrinsic atrial rate increases, eventually the device will only track every other P wave (a fixed 2:1 block response). The occurrence of abrupt 2:1 upper rate behavior may sometimes result in symptoms of presyncope or sudden fatigue in those patients who can exercise to a sufficient degree to achieve atrial rates in excess of the 2:1 block point.</p><p>Contemporary pacemakers are capable of recognizing rapid atrial rates for the purpose of reverting from a tracking to a nontracking mode when the rapid rate is felt to be secondary to a pathologic atrial rhythm. The change in mode is called mode switching. Mode switching requires that the pacemaker be able to detect atrial events occurring within the PVARP even though it does not track these complexes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modes-of-cardiac-pacing-nomenclature-and-selection#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Modes of cardiac pacing: Nomenclature and selection&quot;, section on 'Mode switching'</a>.)</p><p>When the sensed atrial rate exceeds the trigger rate, there is an automatic change in pacing mode from an atrial tracking mode to a mode incapable of atrial tracking, for example from DDD to VVI or DDI, or DDDR to VVIR or DDIR.</p><p>To prevent the pacemaker from detecting a paced or sensed ventricular signal on the atrial channel (called a far field R wave), there is a separate timing interval within the PVARP called the post ventricular atrial blanking (PVAB) period during which the atrial sensing circuit is disabled. It is initiated by the ventricular output or ventricular sensed event.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Maximum tracking rate timer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In an effort to modulate the upper rate behavior, the maximum tracking rate timer is initiated by a paced or sensed ventricular event and must be completed before another ventricular output pulse can be released. Thus, even when a P wave occurs and the AV interval, which was initiated by that sensed atrial event, times out, the release of the ventricular output pulse is delayed until the maximum tracking rate timing period ends.</p><p>While this limits the maximum tracking rate, it also effectively lengthens the interval from the sensed P wave to the ventricular output pulse (PV interval). If the atrial rate is stable, the next sensed P wave occurs closer to the preceding ventricular paced complex; if sensed, the same series of timers is initiated, and another ventricular paced beat occurs at an even longer PV interval. Eventually, a P wave will coincide with the PVARP, not be sensed, and, hence, not be tracked, resulting in a relative pause. The net effect is group beating at a fixed ventricular rate with a progressively increasing PV interval. The group beating and increasing PV interval are similar to AV nodal Wenckebach second degree AV block. As a result, this form of pacing system function is called pseudo<strong>-</strong>Wenckebach upper rate behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dual-chamber-pacing-system-malfunction-evaluation-and-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Other techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other techniques are used to modulate the upper rate behavior of the pacemaker, including rate smoothing and fallback [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dual-chamber-pacing-system-malfunction-evaluation-and-management/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">RATE MODULATED (RESPONSIVE) PACEMAKERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rate-modulation capabilities in dual-chamber pacemakers may result in a number of interesting rhythms since the pacing rate will be controlled by either the sensed P wave or the sensor-input to the pacemaker [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dual-chamber-pacing-system-malfunction-evaluation-and-management/abstract/5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-9</a>]. Rate modulated pacing is of particular value to patients with chronotropic incompetence due to either concomitant pharmacologic therapy or intrinsic conduction system disease; these patients will not increase their native heart rate in response to a physiologic stress.</p><p>With regard to upper rate behavior, there are three definitions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The upper rate limit (URL) is the maximum paced ventricular rate that can occur in any setting.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The maximum tracking rate (MTR) is the maximum paced ventricular rate that can occur in response to sensed atrial activity, defined by the total atrial refractory period (TARP).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The maximum sensor rate (MSR) is the maximum paced ventricular rate that can occur in response to the sensor input to the pacing system.</p><p/><p>Both the MTR and MSR are subsets of the URL. While these two timers are often programmed to identical rates, many pacemakers allow them to be programmed independently.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">TRUE DUAL CHAMBER SYSTEM MALFUNCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>True pacemaker system malfunctions occur when there is loss of capture at a time when the myocardium is capable of being depolarized, loss of sensing when an appropriate signal occurs during an alert period, or oversensing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-tutorial-pacemakers#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ECG tutorial: Pacemakers&quot;, section on 'Pacer malfunction'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Loss of atrial capture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>True loss of atrial capture in a dual-chamber pacemaker results in effective ventricular pacing only. With complete loss of atrial capture, the patient may experience symptoms of pacemaker syndrome. If an atrial stimulus fails to depolarize the atrium and following the subsequent ventricular paced depolarization if retrograde conduction is intact, this may lead to sustained retrograde conduction or even induction of an endless loop tachycardia (ELT). If there is retrograde block, the lack of atrial capture will allow the native atrial rhythm to occur, which will be intermittently tracked, typically appearing as if there were an atrial premature beat simply by juxtaposition of the native atrial rate with the paced rhythm.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Loss of atrial sensing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ECG manifestation of a loss of atrial sensing depends on the status of AV nodal conduction and the intrinsic atrial rate.</p><p>In the presence of complete heart block, loss of atrial sensing will result in AV sequential pacing at the programmed base rate of the pacemaker. P waves will march through the tracing, occasionally being reset when there is atrial capture; at other times, they will render the atrial stimulus ineffective due to functional noncapture resulting in the appearance of fixed AV sequential pacing.</p><p>In the absence of complete heart block, the intrinsic atrial rate will determine the presentation. If P waves were able to be sensed normally then the ECG would demonstrate consistent intrinsic P wave to V-paced intervals (so called PV or P synchronous pacing). A lack of PV pacing would therefore suggest loss of atrial sensing. If the PR interval is normal, however, the loss of atrial sensing may not be readily apparent from the surface ECG since the pacemaker will be appropriately inhibited by the sensed ventricular events.</p><p>Safety pacing, in dual-chamber pacemakers, is the delivery of a ventricular output pulse at an abbreviated AV interval, following atrial pacing, if a signal is sensed by the ventricular channel during the early portion of the AV interval (ie, the cross-talk sensing window or ventricular safety pacing interval which follows the relatively short post-atrial ventricular blanking period). It is used to ensure that ventricular depolarization occurs if the sensed event was something other than an intrinsic ventricular depolarization. The abbreviated AV interval is usually in the range of 100 to 110 ms. If the sensed event was indeed an intrinsic ventricular event, the abbreviated AV interval delivers the pacing artifact early enough to prevent the pacing artifact from being delivered in the vulnerable portion of the cardiac cycle.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Loss of ventricular capture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Loss of ventricular capture is obvious in the presence of high-grade AV block. Loss of ventricular capture is not as apparent when AV conduction is intact, because the ventricular stimulus may coincide with the onset of the conducted QRS. If the QRS is narrow, it will probably be interpreted as a fusion beat. If the QRS is wide, as with a bundle branch block, one may easily be misled into believing that capture is intact. In either case, if the pacing artifact coincides with the native depolarization but does not contribute to the activation of that chamber these events would be designated pseudofusion beats.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Loss of ventricular sensing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Undersensing on the ventricular channel may not be obvious when high-grade AV block is present, as each P wave is tracked and triggers a ventricular output. Even when AV conduction is intact, undersensing may not be recognized unless the ventricular stimulus occurs well after each native QRS. If the AV interval allows the ventricular stimulus to coincide with the conducted R wave, which may be normal depending upon where sensing actually occurs within the QRS, loss of ventricular sensing cannot readily be identified from the surface ECG. In addition, the small diminutive bipolar pacing artifacts may not be easily identified on the usual ECG recording, further complicating the diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Ventricular oversensing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oversensing on the ventricular channel will result in inappropriate pacemaker inhibition and rates that are below the programmed base rate. Depending upon where the oversensing occurs, the sensed ventricular event will also initiate both a ventricular refractory period as well as a PVARP. This may result in functional atrial and ventricular undersensing with failure to recognize intrinsic P waves and R waves.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Atrial oversensing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the DDD mode, oversensing on the atrial channel will be interpreted by the pacemaker as the occurrence of multiple P waves. This may result in periods of more rapidly paced ventricular rhythms as the pacemaker attempts to track what it believes are atrial depolarizations. Symptoms include palpitations from the loss of AV synchrony and salvos of rapid paced ventricular rates or pacemaker syndrome as a result of the effective ventricular pacing. It may also be the initiating trigger for an ELT.</p><p>Far field R wave sensing (ventricular paced or sensed events) may result in the pacing system interpreting a normal rhythm as a pathological atrial rhythm, and it may initiate the mode switching algorithm with loss of atrial tracking. Examination of the markers and atrial electrogram will help to identify the presence of far field R waves. When these are present, the atrial refractory period <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the PVAB should be reprogrammed such that detection of these events are prevented. Inappropriate mode switching in the patient with high grade AV block may result in symptoms of pacemaker syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modes-of-cardiac-pacing-nomenclature-and-selection#H28\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Modes of cardiac pacing: Nomenclature and selection&quot;, section on 'Pacemaker syndrome'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h1\">BIVENTRICULAR PACEMAKERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with significant dyssynchrony due to intrinsic conduction disease, cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) with biventricular (BiV) pacing can improve intraventricular synchrony. This is accomplished with an additional pacemaker lead usually implanted via the coronary sinus to stimulate the left ventricle (LV), most commonly its lateral or posterolateral surface. Simultaneous (or sequential) stimulation of the LV and RV pacing leads provides more synchronous activation of the heart than RV pacing alone, which may actually cause dyssynchronous contraction. Among patients with heart failure who are in sinus rhythm, restoration of ventricular synchrony improves cardiac performance, symptoms, and overall survival. The efficacy of CRT in patients with heart failure and chronic AF is less well established, although available evidence suggests a benefit. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-in-heart-failure-indications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac resynchronization therapy in heart failure: Indications&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-in-atrial-fibrillation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac resynchronization therapy in atrial fibrillation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Biventricular pacemakers are prone to the same problems as dual chamber pacing systems. However, the specific features of device malfunction are in some respects distinct, and therefore merit separate discussion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Pacing system components and pacing mode</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The components of a BiV pacing system typically include an atrial lead in the right atrium, a right ventricular lead in the right ventricle, and a left ventricular lead that is most often placed in a cardiac vein by way of the coronary sinus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F79450\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79450 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Biventricular pacemakers are usually programmed in DDD or DDDR mode if the patient is in normal sinus rhythm. Atrial events that are sensed or paced trigger an AV interval that is intended to be long enough to optimize the atrial contribution to ventricular filling but short enough to ensure ventricular pacing for the vast majority of the time and ideally near 100 percent. Pacing is necessary if resynchronization is to be achieved. Proper timing of the AV delay may require Doppler echocardiography to maximize the left ventricular outflow tract velocity time integral and left ventricular filling and ejection times.</p><p>CRT often results in a QRS complex that is narrower than the native QRS complex because of fusion between the two paced signals. However, QRS duration does not always normalize, and some studies have shown a poor correlation between the width of the paced QRS complex and the clinical benefit of BiV pacing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-resynchronization-therapy-in-heart-failure-indications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac resynchronization therapy in heart failure: Indications&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">CRT malfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Biventricular pacing systems are prone to the same system malfunctions seen with other types of pacemakers. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'True dual chamber system malfunction'</a> above.)</p><p>In addition, there are other system problems that are specific to the CRT setting. Since many patients with BiV pacemakers do not require pacing for the standard indications, pacemaker malfunction will not be associated clinically with syncope or &quot;pacemaker syndrome.&quot; Instead, loss of ventricular synchrony may result in exacerbation of heart failure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h3\">Loss of capture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The left ventricular lead of a BiV pacing system is separated from the myocardium by the full thickness of the vein wall and by any epicardial fat that may be encasing the vein. The capture threshold of the left ventricular lead may be higher than that of the right ventricular lead. In contemporary CRT devices, the right and left ventricular leads can be assessed independently if loss of capture is suspected.</p><p>Loss of capture may be manifested by widening of the QRS complex or by a more subtle change in QRS morphology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dual-chamber-pacing-system-malfunction-evaluation-and-management/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. It is not always possible to recognize loss of capture based upon the surface ECG alone (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F71566\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef71566 \">waveform 1</a>). An intracardiac electrogram obtained by interrogating the pacemaker will commonly demonstrate an obvious change.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h3\">Oversensing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oversensing is the detection of an inappropriate physiologic or nonphysiologic electrical signal. Skeletal muscle potentials generated by isometric contraction of the muscles in close proximity to the pulse generator are the most common etiology of oversensing, although inappropriate sensing of electrical activity in another cardiac chamber is also a potential problem.</p><p>In a BiV pacing system, oversensing of atrial activity on the ventricular channel results in ventricular inhibition and loss of resynchronization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dual-chamber-pacing-system-malfunction-evaluation-and-management/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This can be a result of malposition of the left ventricular lead too close to the AV valve ring.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h3\">Mechanical lead failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All major electrical malfunctions, including loss of capture, undersensing, and oversensing, can be associated with a breach in lead insulation or conductor failure. A breach in lead insulation causes a marked drop in the measured stimulation impedance, while a conductor coil fracture causes a marked increase in impedance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h1\">PACING SYSTEM EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Whether the system involves a single chamber or dual chamber pacemaker, the process for evaluating the pacing system is similar. A detailed discussion of pacing system evaluation is presented separately.

Given the overall reliability of the pulse generators, if a bizarre behavior is encountered, one should consider a device eccentricity, a lead problem, or a recording artifact before entertaining the diagnosis of a pulse generator failure. In these more unusual circumstances, if a definitive diagnosis is not reached, it is always helpful to contact the manufacturer's &quot;help-line&quot; prior to invasive troubleshooting.
