ICD results from direct cytotoxic effect of irritants; unlike allergic contact dermatitis, it is not immune mediated. ICD is a multifactorial disorder influenced by the physical and chemical properties of the irritating substance, host-related susceptibility factors, and environmental factors. </p><p>The clinical manifestations of ICD are similar to those of other acute or chronic eczematous dermatitides, including atopic dermatitis and allergic contact dermatitis.</p><p>This topic will discuss the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of ICD in adults.

ICD represents approximately 80 percent of occupational contact dermatitis and is considered the most frequent cause of hand eczema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/irritant-contact-dermatitis-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. In the general population, the estimated prevalence of hand eczema is about 4 percent; women are more frequently affected than men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/irritant-contact-dermatitis-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The risk of occupational ICD is highest among those with &quot;wet work&quot; exposures such as food handlers, healthcare workers, mechanical industry workers, cleaners, and housekeepers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F56218\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56218 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/irritant-contact-dermatitis-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10852063\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple mechanisms, some of which are not completely understood, are involved in the development of ICD, including [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/irritant-contact-dermatitis-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disruption of the epidermal barrier</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Damage of cell membranes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cytotoxic effect on keratinocytes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cytokine release from keratinocytes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Activation of innate immunity </p><p/><p>The disruption of the epidermal barrier (stratum corneum) by chemical or physical irritants, resulting in increased skin permeability and transepidermal water loss (TEWL), is considered the initiating event of ICD.</p><p>In experimental animal and human models, the acute disruption of the epidermal barrier from exposure to surfactants (eg, sodium lauryl sulfate) induces the release of preformed cytokines such as interleukin (IL) 1 alpha, IL-1 beta, IL-6, and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) alpha from keratinocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/irritant-contact-dermatitis-in-adults/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>]. IL-1 alpha and TNF-alpha act as primary signals for the release of proinflammatory chemokines (eg, CCL20, CCL21, and CXCL8), which attract mononuclear and polymorphonuclear cells at the site of injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/irritant-contact-dermatitis-in-adults/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. In addition, TNF-alpha induces the expression of intercellular adhesion molecules 1 (ICAM-1) on keratinocytes, which promote the infiltration of leukocytes into the epidermis. </p><p>Antiinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-10 and the IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) are also released in response to irritant exposure and may be involved in the resolution of the inflammatory process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/irritant-contact-dermatitis-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p>The pathogenesis of chronic ICD is not completely understood. One hypothesis is that chronic exposure to mild irritants or wet work down-regulates the inflammatory response and stimulates cell proliferation and differentiation. A few studies have compared the cytokine levels in normal skin and in skin areas repeatedly exposed to sodium lauryl sulfate. In chronically irritated skin, the levels of IL-1 alpha and TNF-alpha were lower and the levels of IL-1 RA were higher than those measured in nonirritated skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/irritant-contact-dermatitis-in-adults/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>Some individuals develop a tolerance to chronic exposure to irritants. The adaptation of the skin to repeated irritant exposures is called the hardening phenomenon. The mechanisms underlying the hardening phenomenon are unknown. Irritant-induced changes in skin morphology (eg, acanthosis and hyperkeratosis), lipid composition of the stratum corneum, barrier permeability, and expression of inflammatory mediators may contribute [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/irritant-contact-dermatitis-in-adults/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1199511\"><span class=\"h1\">PREDISPOSING FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The development of irritant contact dermatitis (ICD) is influenced by host-related and environmental factors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1199518\"><span class=\"h2\">Host-related factors</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Age</strong> &ndash; The skin reactivity to irritants is highest in infants and tends to decrease with age.

Common chemical irritants include water and wet work, detergents and surfactants, solvents, oxidizing agents, acids, and alkalis. Physical irritants include metal tools, wood, fiberglass, plant parts, paper, and dust or soil.

High concentrations of most chemicals are sufficient to induce an irritant reaction in almost all individuals, whereas mild irritants may induce an inflammatory response only in susceptible individuals or after repeated or prolonged contact [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/irritant-contact-dermatitis-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p>Different chemicals may act synergistically in inducing dermatitis. Solvents remove the lipids from the stratum corneum whereas detergents remove both lipids and hygroscopic (water holding) substances (eg, filaggrin breakdown products). The combined exposure to solvents and detergents produces an additive effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/irritant-contact-dermatitis-in-adults/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10851981\"><span class=\"h2\">Chemical irritants</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Water and wet work</strong> &ndash; Water is hypotonic and acts as a cytotoxic agent on eroded skin.

Glove manufacturers provide lists of applications, hazards, and chemicals for which their gloves have been tested. We suggest the use of barrier creams and emollients rather than gloves alone for the prevention of ICD in individuals exposed to wet work or other chemical or physical irritants (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Barrier creams and emollients are applied before work and multiple times per day if the exposure continues.
