More than 80 percent of bariatric procedures are performed in women, and approximately half of these are performed in reproductive aged women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-and-pregnancy-after-bariatric-surgery/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Thus, it has become increasingly common for women who have undergone bariatric surgery to present for preconceptional counseling or prenatal care.</p><p>The data presented in this topic review have been derived from retrospective studies, case reports, and personal experience. There are no available data from randomized trials or prospective cohort studies. Other issues related to bariatric surgery are discussed separately (refer to appropriate topic reviews).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPE OF BARIATRIC PROCEDURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bariatric surgical procedures can be divided into two varieties, malabsorptive and restrictive. This difference is based upon the anatomic configuration of the procedure, which in turn contributes to the mechanisms by which they induce weight loss (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F59447\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59447 \">table 1</a>). Some procedures have both a restrictive and malabsorptive component (eg, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bariatric-procedures-for-the-management-of-severe-obesity-descriptions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bariatric procedures for the management of severe obesity: Descriptions&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical implications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important for the clinician to know which procedure a woman has undergone in order to counsel her about potential complications and reproductive issues, as well as possible interventions. Multiple anatomic and physiologic changes that occur after bariatric surgery can affect absorption of medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-and-pregnancy-after-bariatric-surgery/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the patient has undergone placement of a laparoscopic adjustable gastric band procedure, the volume of fluid within the band can be adjusted during pregnancy to help manage pregnancy-related nausea and vomiting and prevent excessive or inadequate gestational weight gain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-and-pregnancy-after-bariatric-surgery/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. The band is tightened by adding more fluid to a reservoir attached to the band, which creates increased pressure and tightens the band. The band is loosened by removing fluid from the reservoir, which reduces pressure in the band and loosens it. The best management of the gastric band during pregnancy has not been determined and there is variation in care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-and-pregnancy-after-bariatric-surgery/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Procedures that create malabsorption, such as biliopancreatic diversion, jejunoileal bypass, or Roux-en-Y bypass, may interfere with the absorption of oral contraceptives, thereby reducing their effectiveness (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Contraception'</a> below).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Restrictive procedures result in a small gastric pouch that may increase the risk of gastric ulceration from drugs such as nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents, which are commonly used for treatment of dysmenorrhea and postpartum pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-and-pregnancy-after-bariatric-surgery/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Use of drugs associated with gastric irritation should be avoided or minimized.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduction in functional intestinal length leads to faster transit time and less time for slow absorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-and-pregnancy-after-bariatric-surgery/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Therefore, combination restrictive-malabsorptive procedures reduce absorption of extended release formulations. These formulations should be avoided, if possible; an immediate release formulation is preferable.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When using oral medications in which a therapeutic level is critical, drug levels should be monitored [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-and-pregnancy-after-bariatric-surgery/abstract/2,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7</a>]. Dosing of common medications (eg, antibiotics, anticoagulants) after bariatric surgery is described in detail separately.

In addition, even in eumenorrheic women, obesity is associated with a longer time to pregnancy despite the same coital frequency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-and-pregnancy-after-bariatric-surgery/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. Obesity also reduces male fertility parameters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-and-pregnancy-after-bariatric-surgery/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obesity-in-pregnancy-complications-and-maternal-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obesity in pregnancy: Complications and maternal management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Both nonsurgical [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-and-pregnancy-after-bariatric-surgery/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>] and surgical weight loss can improve fertility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-and-pregnancy-after-bariatric-surgery/abstract/3,13-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,13-18</a>]. This was illustrated in a series in which 15 of 32 women who were unsuccessful in their attempts to conceive prior to bariatric surgery became pregnant following surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-and-pregnancy-after-bariatric-surgery/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>In different reports, women who conceived following bariatric surgery had infertility rates of 15 to 44 percent prior to surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-and-pregnancy-after-bariatric-surgery/abstract/3,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,15,16</a>]. Return to fertility can be rapid, as all 24 oligomenorrheic women in one series resumed normal menstrual cycles after a mean of 3.4&plusmn;2.1 months postoperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-and-pregnancy-after-bariatric-surgery/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Post-surgical weight loss improves multiple hormonal changes related to polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) (eg, insulin resistance, androgen levels), thereby reducing anovulation and enhancing the potential for conception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-and-pregnancy-after-bariatric-surgery/abstract/17,19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,19-21</a>]. In one study, 70 of 98 anovulatory women regained normal menstrual cycles after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-and-pregnancy-after-bariatric-surgery/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The patients who resumed ovulation lost significantly more weight than those who remained anovulatory.</p><p>In spite of these encouraging data, most experts agree that bariatric surgery is not indicated as a primary treatment of infertility in severely obese women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-and-pregnancy-after-bariatric-surgery/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. In women who remain infertile after surgery, in vitro fertilization could be considered. If indicated, it can be safe and successful, but experience is limited to case reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-and-pregnancy-after-bariatric-surgery/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">TIMING OF CONCEPTION FOLLOWING SURGERY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A joint 2013 clinical practice guideline by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, the Obesity Society, and the American Society for Metabolic &amp; Bariatric Surgery recommended that women avoid conception for 12 to18 months after bariatric surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-and-pregnancy-after-bariatric-surgery/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. We generally advise women to delay pregnancy for 12 to 24 months following bariatric surgery because this time frame is when women are actively losing the most weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-and-pregnancy-after-bariatric-surgery/abstract/11,26-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,26-29</a>]. This delay is done in an effort to optimize weight loss and reduce the potentially adverse effect of post-bariatric surgical nutritional deficiencies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-and-pregnancy-after-bariatric-surgery/abstract/14,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,30</a>]. Since evidence supporting this approach is limited, counseling should be individualized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-and-pregnancy-after-bariatric-surgery/abstract/29,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,31</a>]. As an example, women who undergo gastric banding procedures typically lose weight more gradually than gastric bypass patients. The band can be adjusted if weight loss is deemed too rapid or excessive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-and-pregnancy-after-bariatric-surgery/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. These factors might reduce the concern about conception during the rapid weight loss phase.</p><p>While the optimal interval from bariatric surgery to conception is not known, it is reasonable to advise delaying pregnancy for 24 months after a bariatric procedure based upon the following data:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Effect on neonatal outcome</strong> &ndash; In the largest cohort study comparing neonatal outcomes from over 1850 women grouped by the elapsed time from bariatric surgery to birth, higher rates of prematurity (17 versus 12 percent), neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) admission (18 versus 12 percent), and small for gestational age (SGA) status (13 versus 9 percent) were reported for infants born less than two years from bariatric surgery compared with infants born more than four years after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-and-pregnancy-after-bariatric-surgery/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. These data were adjusted for maternal body mass index, hypertension, and diabetes and the model addressed known confounders such as maternal age, <span class=\"nowrap\">race/ethnicity,</span> educational level, parity, and annual household income. The women in the study had multiple types of bariatric procedures, including banded gastroplasty, adjustable gastric banding, sleeve gastrectomy, or Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Of note, these findings contrast with prior data from much smaller observational studies (range of 34 to 489 pregnancies after bariatric surgery) that suggested that time from bariatric surgery to birth did not impact neonatal complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-and-pregnancy-after-bariatric-surgery/abstract/33-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-36</a>]. The difference in the study sizes is a likely contributor to the outcomes differences. More data are needed to understand the postoperative variables that impact pregnancy outcome and whether or not the data are the same for all types of bariatric procedures</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Effect on gestational weight gain and short-term postpartum weight loss</strong> &ndash; Time to conception after surgery may affect gestational weight gain and postpartum weight loss, but studies have reported discordant results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-and-pregnancy-after-bariatric-surgery/abstract/3,33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,33,34</a>]. In one such study, women who conceived within 12 months of surgery had less weight gain during pregnancy and less weight loss postpartum than those who waited longer before conceiving (mean gestational weight gain (1.8 versus 15.5 kg [4 versus 34 pounds]); mean postpartum weight loss (6.4 versus 9.5 kg [14 versus 21 pounds]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-and-pregnancy-after-bariatric-surgery/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Long-term effect on total weight loss</strong> &ndash; Only limited data are available on the long-term effects of time to conception after surgery on total weight loss. In one study of timing of pregnancy and weight loss, pregnancy during the phase of rapid weight loss did not negatively affect total weight loss: total weight loss in women who conceived before and after 12 months averaged 45 and 51 kg (99 and 113 pounds), respectively, and the final body mass index was also similar for both groups (33 and 31 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>,</span> respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-and-pregnancy-after-bariatric-surgery/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In another study of the effect of pregnancy on weight loss at a median 30 months post-bariatric surgery, women who became pregnant during this interval lost the same percentage of excess weight as women who did not become pregnant (70 percent); the interval between bariatric surgery and first pregnancy was a median 11 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-and-pregnancy-after-bariatric-surgery/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTRACEPTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Contraceptive counseling is an important consideration for all reproductive-aged women undergoing bariatric procedures. This is especially important for adolescents in whom pregnancy rates following surgery are two-fold higher than in the general adolescent population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-and-pregnancy-after-bariatric-surgery/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. While this increase is probably due in large part to enhanced fertility associated with weight loss, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass also appears to reduce absorption of oral contraceptives. </p><p>However, despite recommendations for contraception use during the first 12 to 18 months following surgery, many women do not use contraception. In a prospective cohort study of 710 women of reproductive age who underwent bariatric surgery, 4 percent actively tried to conceive, and 41 percent had unprotected intercourse while not trying to conceive during the first postsurgical year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-and-pregnancy-after-bariatric-surgery/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Risk factors for not using contraception included advancing age, being married or cohabitating, and preoperatively rating future pregnancy as important. This study highlights the need for careful preoperative contraception counseling and continued postoperative counseling to avoid rapid conception during the first postoperative year.</p><p>The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends using nonoral forms of hormonal contraception in women who have undergone malabsorptive bariatric surgery and desire hormonal contraception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-and-pregnancy-after-bariatric-surgery/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

Sometimes they are reduced to the frequency of adverse events in nonobese patients. The magnitude of the effect of surgery on pregnancy outcomes varies depending upon the control group (general obstetric population, obese women who have not undergone surgery, or pre- versus post-bariatric surgery pregnancy outcomes in the same group of patients).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Miscarriage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although nonsurgical weight loss may reduce the risk of miscarriage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-and-pregnancy-after-bariatric-surgery/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], available data on the impact of bariatric procedures on miscarriage rate have not consistently shown a benefit.

Two large retrospective studies illustrate these findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A comparison of outcomes of 670 singleton pregnancies among women who had undergone bariatric surgery reported a reduced risk of GDM compared with pregnancies of women matched for pre-bariatric surgery body mass index (BMI) who had not undergone surgery (2 versus 7 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-and-pregnancy-after-bariatric-surgery/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another study evaluated women who were pregnant before and after bariatric surgery.

However, it is unclear if bariatric surgery is an independent risk factor for preterm birth. Three large cohort studies reported that women who underwent bariatric surgery had an increased risk of preterm delivery (&lt;37 weeks of gestation) compared with controls who had not undergone bariatric surgery matched for both presurgery BMI and prepregnancy BMI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-and-pregnancy-after-bariatric-surgery/abstract/32,54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,54,55</a>]. In one cohort study, the risk of moderately preterm birth (between 32 completed weeks and 36 weeks 6 days of gestation) was higher for the women who had undergone bariatric surgery as compared with women matched to presurgery BMI (7.3 versus 5.7 percent, odds ratio 1.30, 95% CI 1.05-1.60), but the risk of very preterm delivery (&lt;32 weeks gestation) was not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-and-pregnancy-after-bariatric-surgery/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. The elevated risks of preterm delivery applied only to spontaneous preterm birth and not medically indicated preterm birth. Two other studies reported an increased risk of premature birth (&lt;37 weeks of gestation) and early preterm birth (&lt;32 weeks of gestation) in women who had undergone bariatric surgery when compared with non-surgical controls matched by postoperative BMI. While this suggests that prior bariatric surgery may be a risk factor for preterm delivery, one cannot conclude if this risk would have been higher without the surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-and-pregnancy-after-bariatric-surgery/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>These studies contrast with the results of a prior a systematic review and two smaller cohort studies that reported no increased risk of preterm delivery after bariatric surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-and-pregnancy-after-bariatric-surgery/abstract/43,51,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,51,56</a>]. Until further data are available, we counsel women that bariatric surgery may be an independent risk factor for spontaneous preterm delivery; however, the degree of this risk would not warrant preemptive administration of antenatal corticosteroids.

The control group was matched for prepregnancy BMI, age, parity, delivery year, and smoking status. These findings may be explained by continued maternal weight loss and induced malabsorption from the procedure.

Absorption of iron and folate are reduced due to lower acid content in the gastric pouch and bypass of the duodenum, the main site of absorption.

Consultation with a bariatric surgeon is advisable if the patient had a complicated bariatric surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-and-pregnancy-after-bariatric-surgery/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Patients who have undergone uncomplicated bariatric surgery generally do not require alteration in cesarean delivery technique. Some obstetricians favor blunt entry into the peritoneum to minimize risk of inadvertent injury to bowel that may be adherent to the underlying surface.</p><p>Specific recommendations regarding surgical considerations in the obese patient are described elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cesarean-delivery-of-the-obese-woman\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cesarean delivery of the obese woman&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15290794\"><span class=\"h2\">Anesthesia for cesarean</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients who have undergone abdominoplasty, standard methods of assessment of the sensory level of subarachnoid block can be misleading because of dermatomal changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-and-pregnancy-after-bariatric-surgery/abstract/100,101\" class=\"abstract_t\">100,101</a>]. Testing the posterolateral abdomen is more reliable than the anterior abdomen for determining the anesthesia level in these patients, as there is a downward shift in sensory dermatomal level anteriorly. Patients may retain sensation in the anterior abdominal skin despite an adequate posterolateral dermatomal level. Supplemental local anesthesia by the surgeon or a lower surgical incision should then be considered.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTPARTUM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lactation is usually not adversely affected by bariatric surgery and should be encouraged.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is important for the clinician to know specifically which bariatric procedure a woman has undergone in order to counsel her about the prevention and management of potential complications and reproductive issues (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F59447\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59447 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Type of bariatric procedure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnancy planning and contraception options should be discussed with women who undergo bariatric surgery. Fertility improves soon after bariatric surgery, particularly in women who had been anovulatory. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Fertility before and after surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oral contraceptives may be less effective in women who have undergone malabsorptive bariatric surgery. For women who have undergone these procedures and who desire hormonal contraception, we suggest non-oral forms of hormonal contraception (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Contraception'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest delaying pregnancy for 12 months following bariatric surgery (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). This provides time to optimize weight loss and reduce potential adverse effects of nutritional deficiencies. However, women who conceive proximate to their bariatric surgery can be reassured of a likely favorable pregnancy outcome with optimization of nutrition and careful monitoring and follow-up. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Timing of conception following surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After bariatric surgery, many women have uncomplicated pregnancies and healthy babies, especially if they achieve a normal body mass index (BMI). Bariatric surgery likely reduces risk of preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, and macrosomia when compared to obese women who have not undergone a bariatric procedure. The risks of spontaneous preterm delivery, cesarean delivery, and congenital anomalies appear to be the same or lower than in obese women who have not undergone a bariatric procedure, but data are less consistent than for other outcomes. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Pregnancy outcomes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bariatric surgery may increase the risk of intrauterine growth <span class=\"nowrap\">restriction/small</span> for gestational age infant, particularly in women who have undergone gastric bypass procedures. For this reason, we perform serial ultrasound examinations in the third trimester to evaluate fetal growth. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Growth restriction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Fetal growth assessment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend micronutrient supplementation and laboratory monitoring for micronutrient deficiencies in pregnancies after any bariatric surgical procedure. This is facilitated by co-management by an obstetrician, bariatric surgeon, and dietitian. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Micronutrient supplementation'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bariatric-surgery-postoperative-nutritional-management#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bariatric surgery: Postoperative nutritional management&quot;, section on 'Micronutrient management'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women with prior Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) should not undergo the 50-g glucose challenge test used to screen for gestational diabetes (GDM), as it is likely to cause dumping syndrome. An exception can be made if the patient regularly drinks sugared soft drinks. We suggest following fasting and postprandial blood sugars for one week as an alternative screening test. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Gestational diabetes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In women with abdominal pain or other gastrointestinal symptoms, the possibility of a complication of bariatric surgery, such as bowel obstruction, volvulus, or intussusception, must be excluded. We recommend a low threshold for abdominal computed tomography (CT) for evaluation of these women and early consultation with a bariatric surgeon. Exploratory surgery may be necessary, even after a negative CT. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring for complications of bariatric surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with adjustable gastric bands, the gastric band can be loosened to facilitate adequate gestational weight gain. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Gestational weight gain'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cesarean delivery is performed for standard obstetrical indications. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Mode of delivery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We refer women who have undergone a bariatric surgery procedure for preconception or antepartum consultation with a maternal-fetal medicine clinician to discuss potential issues for pregnancy and their management.</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fertility-and-pregnancy-after-bariatric-surgery/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Santry HP, Gillen DL, Lauderdale DS.
