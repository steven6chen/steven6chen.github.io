It can be given every 3 months (13 weeks) because low solubility of the microcrystals at the injection site allows pharmacologically active drug levels to persist and remain effective for several months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depot-medroxyprogesterone-acetate-for-contraception/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Following a single intramuscular dose of DMPA, the drug level increases for approximately three weeks, reaching a peak blood concentration of up to 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> for a few days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depot-medroxyprogesterone-acetate-for-contraception/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].

This enables a 30 percent lower dose of progestin (104 versus 150 mg) and reduces peak blood levels by half [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depot-medroxyprogesterone-acetate-for-contraception/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], but with the same duration of effect as conventional DMPA. Administration via the SC route is less painful than IM injection and potentially may allow patient self-administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depot-medroxyprogesterone-acetate-for-contraception/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>].

Depot <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medroxyprogesterone-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">medroxyprogesterone acetate</a> (DMPA) primarily acts by inhibition of gonadotropin secretion, thereby inhibiting follicular maturation and ovulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depot-medroxyprogesterone-acetate-for-contraception/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The inhibition of ovarian function results in a hypoestrogenic state, which inhibits endometrial proliferation and renders the endometrium less receptive to implantation. Progestins also cause changes in cervical mucus (thicker and less permeable to sperm) and tubal motility (reduced ciliary action) that are unfavorable to sperm migration, thus inhibiting fertilization.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFICACY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Depot <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medroxyprogesterone-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">medroxyprogesterone acetate</a> (DMPA) is a highly effective contraceptive. The unintended pregnancy rate for the first year of perfect use of DMPA has been estimated at 0.2 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F70218\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70218 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depot-medroxyprogesterone-acetate-for-contraception/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This estimate is a weighted average derived from seven trials of the 150 mg intramuscular dose and two trials of the 104 mg subcutaneous dose. Of note, no pregnancies occurred in women using the 104 mg subcutaneous injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depot-medroxyprogesterone-acetate-for-contraception/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. </p><p>For women with typical use during the first year of DMPA use, an unintended pregnancy rate of 6 percent has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depot-medroxyprogesterone-acetate-for-contraception/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This typical-use failure rate likely reflects women who returned late for the next injection. In a study of women using DMPA who returned consistently and on time for injections, the three-year cumulative failure rate for DMPA was 0.7 percent, which is comparable to the failure rate for women using intrauterine devices (IUDs) and the contraceptive implant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depot-medroxyprogesterone-acetate-for-contraception/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

In the United States Planned Parenthood National Database for 1994 to 1998, 402 DMPA users became pregnant and many of these women received more than one dose of DMPA while pregnant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depot-medroxyprogesterone-acetate-for-contraception/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. No fetal anomalies were reported; however, birth outcome data were incomplete.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>First day of menses </strong>&ndash; The ideal time to initiate DMPA is within seven days of the onset of menses. This approach increases the certainty that the patient is not pregnant at the time of injection and prevents ovulation during the first month of use, so that back-up contraception is unnecessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depot-medroxyprogesterone-acetate-for-contraception/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Most women have pharmacologically active drug levels and relatively impermeable cervical mucus within 24 hours after injection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Quick start </strong>&ndash; Several studies have initiated DMPA on the day the patient is first seen for contraception, rather than waiting until her next menses begins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depot-medroxyprogesterone-acetate-for-contraception/abstract/28-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-31</a>], as long as pregnancy can be excluded with reasonable certainty by history or pregnancy testing. This &quot;same day&quot; &quot;quick start&quot; or &quot;Depo-now&quot; approach facilitates DMPA initiation for many users, and thus may prevent some pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depot-medroxyprogesterone-acetate-for-contraception/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If DMPA is initiated more than seven days after the first day of the woman's menstrual period and she has had unprotected intercourse during the cycle, clinicians and patients must recognize that there is a small chance of preimplantation or early pregnancy despite a negative pregnancy test prior to the injection. We suggest these women receive emergency contraception if intercourse occurred within the previous 120 hours, and we advise them to use back-up contraception for seven days after DMPA injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depot-medroxyprogesterone-acetate-for-contraception/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>] since ovulation may occur within 24 hours of the initial injection, and we counsel them to have a repeat pregnancy test in two to three weeks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Switching from another method </strong>&ndash; Begin DMPA while the woman is still using hormonal contraception (pill, patch, ring), and discontinue the other method seven days after the injection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F77410\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77410 \">table 3</a>). Otherwise, a condom or abstinence should be used as a back-up if the first injection is not given within seven days of menses onset. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If switching from intrauterine contraception, the injection should be given seven days before removal of the intrauterine device (IUD). Otherwise, switching from an IUD requires consideration of fertilization and implantation from residual sperm in the reproductive tract.

After a 150 mg injection, ovulation does not occur for at least 14 weeks. Therefore, a two-week &quot;grace period&quot; (repeat injection without pregnancy testing) is appropriate for women receiving injections every 3 months (13 weeks). In women more than two weeks late for their injection (&gt;15 weeks from the last injection), we suggest a pregnancy test before administering DMPA and back-up contraception (or abstinence) for seven days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depot-medroxyprogesterone-acetate-for-contraception/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In the United States, CDC guidelines support this approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depot-medroxyprogesterone-acetate-for-contraception/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]; however, the package labeling is more conservative and recommends excluding pregnancy prior to reinjection in women more than one week late for their injection or &gt;14 weeks from their last injection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">As a result of a study showing that contraceptive efficacy is maintained with a grace period as long as four weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depot-medroxyprogesterone-acetate-for-contraception/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>], the World Health Organization (WHO) adopted a longer grace period in its updated guideline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depot-medroxyprogesterone-acetate-for-contraception/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In this study of 2290 women in developing countries who underwent 13,608 DMPA cycles, the pregnancy risk per 100 women-years was statistically similar for users who were &quot;on time&quot; for their injection (0.6, 95% CI 0.33-0.92; 12,508 cycles), users who were two weeks late for their injection (0.0; 95% CI 0.0-1.88; 739 cycles), and users who were four weeks late for their injection (0.4; 95% CI 0.01-2.29; 893 cycles) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depot-medroxyprogesterone-acetate-for-contraception/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. A limitation of these data is that more than one third of the women in the study were lactating, placing them at low baseline risk for conception.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Because pregnancy testing may not be readily available in low resource countries, expanding the grace period to four weeks is reasonable in such settings. In high resource countries, we continue to encourage women to return on time and allow a two-week grace period, and require documentation of a negative pregnancy test in women who present more than two weeks (&gt;15 weeks from their last injection).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Women who return early for a repeat injection </strong>&ndash; If it is more convenient for a patient to move up the date of her DMPA injection, a repeat injection may be given early [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depot-medroxyprogesterone-acetate-for-contraception/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7226619\"><span class=\"h1\">DISCONTINUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><strong>Discontinuation rates at </strong>one year range from 40 to 75 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depot-medroxyprogesterone-acetate-for-contraception/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1270312\"><span class=\"h2\">Return to fertility after discontinuation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although depot <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medroxyprogesterone-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">medroxyprogesterone acetate</a> (DMPA)<strong> </strong>does not permanently impact endocrine function, return of fertility may be delayed.

Proactive, candid counseling on both the side effects of DMPA, especially bleeding irregularities, and the need for timed injections is important because women who are well-informed when they choose this method of contraception are much more likely to become satisfied users with high continuation rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depot-medroxyprogesterone-acetate-for-contraception/abstract/30,38-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,38-42</a>]. In a randomized trial, women who received information on risks, benefits, and overall characteristics of DMPA at each visit and counseling that emphasized that potential side effects were not harmful were much less likely to discontinue the method within 12 months than the usual care group (OR 0.27, 95% CI 0.16-0.44) and much less likely to discontinue the method because of menstrual disturbances (OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.11-0.37) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depot-medroxyprogesterone-acetate-for-contraception/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">SIDE EFFECTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Side effects usually decrease or stop within the first few months after starting injections.

Side effects associated with DMPA use were illustrated in a clinical trial in which over 3900 DMPA users were followed for up to seven years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depot-medroxyprogesterone-acetate-for-contraception/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The following side effects were reported by more than 5 percent of subjects: menstrual irregularities (unscheduled bleeding or amenorrhea), weight changes, headache, abdominal pain or discomfort, nervousness, dizziness, and asthenia. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Menstrual changes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Menstrual changes occur in all women using DMPA and are the most frequent reason for discontinuation. In many cases, women become anxious over menstrual changes because of concerns that the changes are due to pregnancy or gynecologic disease. Proactive patient education before initiation of DMPA, as well as supportive follow-up, can markedly reduce these concerns. Women who will not tolerate the menstrual changes that inevitably accompany use of DMPA are counseled to choose an alternative contraceptive.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1267324\"><span class=\"h3\">Unscheduled bleeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During the first months of use, episodes of unpredictable bleeding and spotting lasting seven days or longer are common. The frequency and duration of such unscheduled bleeding decrease with increasing duration of use.</p><p>If persistent spotting or unscheduled bleeding in the first few months of use is unacceptable to a DMPA user who otherwise wishes to continue using this method, one option is to administer oral or transdermal estrogen supplements. The efficacy of supplemental estrogen for prevention or treatment of active unscheduled bleeding in DMPA users is unclear. Trials have reported discordant findings.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-abnormal-uterine-bleeding-in-nonpregnant-reproductive-age-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to abnormal uterine bleeding in nonpregnant reproductive-age women&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Once these conditions have been excluded, further evaluation for repeat bleeding episodes is not necessary unless the woman develops new signs or symptoms (eg, heavy bleeding, pain, vaginal discharge, new abnormal findings on pelvic examination). Women are educated that unscheduled bleeding can persist for the duration of contraceptive use. If a treatable cause of the unscheduled bleeding is not found and the patient remains dissatisfied with the menstrual changes caused by DMPA, then she may be better served by another contraceptive method.

We counsel women that absence of bleeding represents an expected and reversible phenomenon associated with DMPA use and that amenorrhea (along with a reduction or elimination of menstrual cramps) can be viewed as one of the advantages of using this method [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depot-medroxyprogesterone-acetate-for-contraception/abstract/45-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Weight changes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Concerns about weight gain may limit some women's choice of DMPA and other progestin-only methods. Observational studies have reported variable effects of DMPA on weight gain. These studies are difficult to interpret because individuals tend to gain weight over time irrespective of contraceptive use. Discontinuation of and changes in contraceptive methods over time, as well as variability in study design, characteristics of the participants, and endpoints also prevent using observational data to make definite conclusions about the effect of contraception on weight. </p><p>A 2013 systematic review (meta-analysis could not be performed) of studies on the effects of progestin-only contraceptives on weight concluded mean gain was &lt;2 kg for most studies up to 12 months and usually similar to the comparison group using another contraceptive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depot-medroxyprogesterone-acetate-for-contraception/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].

For example, one group observed that black women gain more weight over time with use of various types of contraception (implant, DMPA, copper IUD, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levonorgestrel-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levonorgestrel</a> IUD) than non-black women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depot-medroxyprogesterone-acetate-for-contraception/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. In addition, a 2013 systematic review of three studies observed that DMPA users who gained &gt;5 percent of baseline body weight within six months of starting DMPA appeared to be at increased risk of weight gain over the following two to three years; however, attrition and loss to follow-up was a major limitation of these studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depot-medroxyprogesterone-acetate-for-contraception/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. </p><p>Randomized trials, although not definitive, have not reported significant weight gain in DMPA users.

However, the results of these trials are not generalizable since the first trial involved only 20 volunteers who received only 1 injection of DMPA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depot-medroxyprogesterone-acetate-for-contraception/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>] and, in the other two trials, controls were given leuprolide rather than another contraceptive drug or no contraceptive drug.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Headache</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although natural progesterone and oral progestins have been reported to reduce the frequency of migraine, DMPA appears to trigger headache as a side effect in susceptible patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depot-medroxyprogesterone-acetate-for-contraception/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>]. However, a history of headache is not a contraindication to DMPA use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depot-medroxyprogesterone-acetate-for-contraception/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Mood changes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Observational studies have not reported any consistent effects of DMPA on mood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depot-medroxyprogesterone-acetate-for-contraception/abstract/56-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">56-59</a>].

One of the contraceptive actions of DMPA results from suppression of gonadotropin secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depot-medroxyprogesterone-acetate-for-contraception/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], which in turn suppresses ovarian estradiol production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depot-medroxyprogesterone-acetate-for-contraception/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. In hypoestrogenic states, bone resorption exceeds bone formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depot-medroxyprogesterone-acetate-for-contraception/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>], resulting in a decline in bone mineral density (BMD). The rate of bone loss is not linear; the greatest loss is during the first one to two years of use, after which BMD appears to plateau (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F61971\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61971 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depot-medroxyprogesterone-acetate-for-contraception/abstract/66-71\" class=\"abstract_t\">66-71</a>]. Compared to nonusers, BMD at the hip and spine of DMPA users decreases by 0.5 to 3.5 percent after one year of use, 5.7 to 7.5 percent after two years of use, and 5.2 to 5.4 percent after five years of use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depot-medroxyprogesterone-acetate-for-contraception/abstract/68-70,72,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">68-70,72,73</a>].

Reversal at the spine occurred sooner, and appeared to be more complete, than reversal at the hip. Although there is an association between current DMPA use and decreased BMD, there are few data on the effect of BMD changes in younger women on their short- or long-term fracture risk. The best available data suggest that DMPA use does not reduce peak bone mass and does not increase the risk of osteoporotic fracture in later life in women at average risk of osteoporosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depot-medroxyprogesterone-acetate-for-contraception/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. </p><p>We are not aware of published data addressing the skeletal safety of DMPA when used in <span class=\"nowrap\">immobilized/wheelchair-bound</span> adolescents or women. We feel that theoretical skeletal concerns associated with DMPA use should not prevent its use in <span class=\"nowrap\">immobilized/wheelchair-bound</span> women, given its advantages in this patient population: convenience (amenorrhea makes hygiene easier) and avoidance of the increased risk of venous thrombosis associated with both immobility and estrogen-based contraceptives. &#160;</p><p>Although observational studies have reported an increased risk of fracture in current DMPA users compared with non-users [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depot-medroxyprogesterone-acetate-for-contraception/abstract/87-91\" class=\"abstract_t\">87-91</a>], DMPA users differ behaviorally in a variety of ways from non-users and these differences may impact their risk of traumatic fractures, thus it is difficult to draw clinical inferences from these findings. A retrospective cohort study provided reassuring data: DMPA users had higher incident fracture risk than never users before beginning DMPA (incidence rate ratio 1.28) and after beginning DMPA (incidence rate ratio 1.23), but the fracture risk in DMPA users did not increase significantly after starting DMPA (incidence rate ratio before and after starting DMPA: 1.01 (95% CI 0.92-1.11) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depot-medroxyprogesterone-acetate-for-contraception/abstract/91,92\" class=\"abstract_t\">91,92</a>]. Long-term prospective data are not available.</p><p>Despite the lack of a proven increase in fracture rate, in 2004, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a black box warning on DMPA package labeling: &quot;Women who use DMPA may lose significant bone mineral density. Bone loss is greater with increasing duration of use and may not be completely reversible. It is unknown if use of DMPA during adolescence or early adulthood, a critical period of bone accretion, will reduce peak bone mass and increase the risk for osteoporotic fracture in later life. DMPA should be used as a long-term birth control method (eg, longer than two years) only if other birth control methods are inadequate.&quot; The addition of this warning to DMPA's package labeling appears to have led some clinicians in the United States to restrict the duration of DMPA use in their patients and to inappropriately order BMD testing in women using DMPA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depot-medroxyprogesterone-acetate-for-contraception/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1269195\"><span class=\"h3\">Counseling patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We, and others, including the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG), the Society for Adolescent Health and Medicine (SAHM), the World Health Organization (WHO), and the Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (SOGC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depot-medroxyprogesterone-acetate-for-contraception/abstract/94-99\" class=\"abstract_t\">94-99</a>], believe that the advantages of DMPA use as a contraceptive generally outweigh the theoretical concerns regarding skeletal harm. Accordingly, skeletal health concerns should not restrict initiation or continuation of DMPA in adolescent girls, women 18 to 45 years of age, or older reproductive age women (age more than 45 years). The available evidence also does <strong>not</strong> justify limiting the duration of DMPA therapy, which may be continued for decades. </p><p>Given that the effect of DMPA on BMD is similar to that with pregnancy (decrease in BMD of 2 to 8 percent) or lactation (decrease in BMD of 3 to 5 percent ) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depot-medroxyprogesterone-acetate-for-contraception/abstract/100,101\" class=\"abstract_t\">100,101</a>], use of DMPA is not an indication for BMD testing (eg, dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry [DXA]) either before, during, or in follow-up of its administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depot-medroxyprogesterone-acetate-for-contraception/abstract/97,99\" class=\"abstract_t\">97,99</a>].</p><p>Some clinicians prescribe supplemental hormone replacement doses of oral or transdermal estrogen in long-term DMPA users who have additional risk factors for low BMD.

This approach is based on data from randomized trials in which menopausal doses of estrogen supplements given to adolescent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depot-medroxyprogesterone-acetate-for-contraception/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>] and adult DMPA users [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depot-medroxyprogesterone-acetate-for-contraception/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>] prevented declines in BMD. These studies provided evidence that the loss in BMD was estrogen-related and that the effects of estrogen on bone metabolism were not impaired by DMPA. We feel there is insufficient evidence to make specific clinical recommendations regarding estrogen supplementation for DMPA users, in part, because it appears that estrogen from an exogenous (supplemental estrogen) or endogenous (ovarian) source results in similar recovery of BMD following DMPA discontinuation.</p><p>There are no data on use of other antiresorptive agents (eg, bisphosphonates, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcitonin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcitonin</a>, selective estrogen receptor modulators) to prevent bone loss in DMPA users.

Therefore, it is reasonable to continue DMPA without gonadotropin testing until the patient is in her mid-50s. At that time, contraception can be discontinued. </p><p>Although serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) concentrations increase across the menopausal transition, a single elevated FSH level is not useful in determining menopausal status in any woman because FSH levels vary from cycle to cycle and may fluctuate between the normal premenopausal and postmenopausal ranges [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depot-medroxyprogesterone-acetate-for-contraception/abstract/168\" class=\"abstract_t\">168</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H26226355\" class=\"local\">'Timing of injections'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Repeat injections'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Proactive counseling about side effects, particularly the high frequency of amenorrhea and unscheduled bleeding, is important to enhance continuation of the method. (See <a href=\"#H26226042\" class=\"local\">'Counseling'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Side effects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Menstrual changes occur in all women using DMPA and are the most frequent cause for discontinuation. During the first months of use, episodes of irregular bleeding and spotting lasting seven days or longer are common. The frequency and duration of such bleeding decrease with increasing duration of use. After one year of use, 50 percent of women experience amenorrhea, and with ongoing use, the rate of amenorrhea increases to 75 percent. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Menstrual changes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is an association between current DMPA use and decreased bone mineral density (BMD); losses in BMD are temporary and reverse after discontinuation of DMPA. There is no evidence of an increase in risk of fractures. We believe that, in all age groups, the advantages of DMPA use as a contraceptive generally outweigh the theoretical concerns regarding skeletal harm. We suggest <strong>not</strong> avoiding DMPA as a contraceptive option in adolescent girls and older reproductive age women (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1269117\" class=\"local\">'Reduction in bone mineral density'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast to package labeling, we suggest <strong>not</strong> avoiding DMPA as a contraceptive option in women with an uncomplicated past history of venous thrombosis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). However, for women with multiple risk factors for arterial cardiovascular disease (eg, smoking, older age, diabetes, hypertension that is poorly controlled or associated with vascular disease), women with a history of stroke or ischemic heart disease, and women with current venous thrombosis, the risks of DMPA use may exceed the benefits. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Cardiovascular and thromboembolic risk'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Return of fertility may be delayed after discontinuing DMPA, but within 10 months of the last injection, 50 percent of women who are trying to conceive will become pregnant; in a small proportion of women, however, fertility is not reestablished until 18 months after the last injection. (See <a href=\"#H1270312\" class=\"local\">'Return to fertility after discontinuation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women can safely continue use of DMPA without gonadotropin testing until in the mid-50s. At that time, contraception can be discontinued. Perimenopausal DMPA users will not experience the bothersome irregular bleeding that characteristically accompanies the perimenopausal transition and may not experience vasomotor symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Perimenopausal women'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/depot-medroxyprogesterone-acetate-for-contraception/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Mishell DR Jr. Pharmacokinetics of depot medroxyprogesterone acetate contraception.
