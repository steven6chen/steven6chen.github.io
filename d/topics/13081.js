Accumulating evidence suggests that these epithelial neoplasms can be divided into two groups in terms of probable site of origin: either ovarian or tubal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-serous-carcinomas/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The first group of carcinomas, which have a plausible origin in the ovary, include those with the following histologies: endometrioid, mucinous, clear cell, borderline, and low grade serous. Some of these appear to arise from endometriosis, a benign condition that may involve the ovaries. This is the case for endometrioid and clear cell carcinomas.</p><p>M&uuml;llerian inclusions in the ovarian cortex are another potential source of primary ovarian carcinomas. These have been implicated in the development of mucinous and lower grade serous neoplasms. The evidence for this is morphologic evidence of a gradual spectrum of changes seen in the ovary, potentially proceeding from cortical inclusions to cystadenofibromas to borderline and low grade serous carcinomas. </p><p>The fallopian tubes, uterus, cervix, and upper vagina derive from M&uuml;llerian (paramesonephric) tissue, while the ovary develops from the primordial germ cells and surrounding surface epithelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-serous-carcinomas/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Primary M&uuml;llerian neoplasms of the ovary likely originate from cells acquired during the reproductive years, with possibilities including transport of epithelial cells from the fallopian tubes or endometrium (lining of the uterus). An older theory is M&uuml;llerian metaplasia of ovarian surface epithelium.</p><p>The second group consists of extrauterine pelvic serous carcinomas, particularly those that are high grade and are associated with a poor prognosis. These have traditionally been thought to be primary ovarian carcinomas, with a few designated as fallopian tube carcinoma (if the bulk of disease was in a fallopian tube) or peritoneal carcinoma (if little or no ovarian or fallopian tube disease was present). The consistent features of these carcinomas have been rapid progression, extra-ovarian disease at the time of diagnosis, and the absence of a known precursor lesion. Evidence suggests that many of these neoplasms may originate in the fallopian tube. Based upon this theoretical framework, we will use the term &quot;extrauterine pelvic serous carcinoma&quot; to refer to these carcinomas, implying a possible origin in the ovary, tube, or M&uuml;llerian epithelium elsewhere in the peritoneal cavity.<br/></p><p>The evolving concept of the pathogenesis of extrauterine pelvic serous carcinoma is reviewed here. An overview of the histopathology of ovarian carcinoma and the diagnosis of ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal cancer are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-histopathology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epithelial carcinoma of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum: Histopathology&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-and-peritoneum-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epithelial carcinoma of the ovary, fallopian tube, and peritoneum: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8781633\"><span class=\"h1\">POTENTIAL PRECURSOR LESIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several precursor lesions have been proposed for epithelial ovarian carcinoma, and different types of disease may arise from different precursors. End-stage disease that is similar in appearance may have arisen from different tissues of origin. </p><p>In this discussion, the term &quot;precursor&quot; denotes a spectrum of changes preceding invasive or metastatic carcinoma that range from innocuous appearing epithelial changes to those that appear cytologically malignant (highly atypical) but have yet to invade or metastasize. Some precursors are &quot;latent&quot; and, while providing clues to the pathogenesis of cancer, are of no clinical significance. These include morphologically normal appearing epithelium in the fallopian tube with clonal mutations of the gene encoding p53 (<em>TP53</em>), referred to as p53 signatures, or foci of benign endometriosis with <em>ARID1A</em> mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-serous-carcinomas/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The focus of the discussion below will be on biologic changes that are morphologically conspicuous and have implications for management.</p><p>There appear to be different precursor lesions for low grade and high grade extrauterine pelvic serous carcinomas. Low grade neoplasms (including borderline neoplasms and low grade serous carcinoma) may develop gradually due to multiple genetic aberrations in dividing cells that would typically give rise to M&uuml;llerian epithelium, such as ovarian cortical inclusion cysts. The biology of these changes is one encouraging slow growth, preservation of epithelial differentiation, and a more gradual progression to malignant neoplasm, if it occurs. In contrast, the process of neoplastic transformation giving rise to high grade carcinomas includes more dramatic biologic changes that promote a more sudden transition from <span class=\"nowrap\">normal/non-neoplastic</span> to malignant neoplasm and loss of differentiation. The prototype for this process is the development of serous tubal intraepithelial <span class=\"nowrap\">neoplasia/carcinoma</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-serous-carcinomas/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H636620564\"><span class=\"h2\">Serous tubal intraepithelial neoplasia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A potential precursor lesion for pelvic high grade serous carcinomas is serous tubal intraepithelial neoplasia (STIN). STIN is an expansile lesion in the fallopian tube with evidence of <em>TP53</em> mutations and morphologic atypia. Some experts have questioned whether lesions that have low grade morphology are neoplasms.</p><p>The discovery of STIN has implications for the understanding of the pathogenesis of and the clinical approach to extrauterine pelvic serous carcinoma:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It establishes the fallopian tube as a potential site of origin for many extrauterine pelvic serous carcinomas</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It underscores the importance of complete examination of the tubes, especially the distal one-third in cases with or at risk for serous cancer</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It expands the debate over the significance of tubal intraepithelial neoplasia in the setting of widespread carcinoma</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most importantly, it has ignited a debate over the histologic threshold and rationale for a diagnosis of &quot;intraepithelial carcinoma&quot;</p><p/><p>Histologically, there is a spectrum of tubal <span class=\"nowrap\">atypias/lesions</span> that might be classified as STIN, and it is difficult to determine which of these lesions should be approached as potentially life threatening <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> neoplastic. Many lesions, while expansile, do not exhibit sufficient epithelial atypia to warrant concern. Such abnormalities might simply be diagnosed as tubal atypia with an understanding that they are not malignant, may not be neoplastic, and impose no risk to the patient once removed. Terms that have been applied to these lesions include <strong>serous tubal intraepithelial lesions (STIL)</strong> or <strong>STIN with mild or moderate atypia</strong>. The possibility that such atypias could shed cells to the peritoneum that will later become malignant exists, but is unproven. Thus, based on what is known at this time, these lesions require no further action. Histologic features of STILs include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A process occupying one or more tubal plicae</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A pseudostratified cohesive epithelium with preserved cell orientation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low proliferative index</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preservation of ciliated differentiation</p><p/><p>Other lesions exhibit histologic features that are virtually identical to the morphologic changes associated with intraepithelial carcinoma of the endometrium. We refer to these as <strong>serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma (STIC)</strong> or <strong>STIN with severe atypia</strong> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F86927\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86927 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-serous-carcinomas/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. In contrast, some experts advise that given that the risk of a high grade serous tubal intraepithelial neoplasm in the absence of other disease is not known or low, the term carcinoma should not be used to describe these lesions.</p><p>These lesions exhibit the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Variably stratified fallopian tube epithelium with nuclear pleomorphism</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An increased <span class=\"nowrap\">nuclear/cytoplasmic</span> ratio</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prominent nucleoli</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Variable loss of cell polarity with intraepithelial fractures, loss of cohesion, exfoliation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased proliferation with an intact basement membrane</p><p/><p>Intraepithelial neoplasm in the fallopian tube was described as early as 1950 as a potential precursor of fallopian tube serous carcinoma, but it was not until the 2000s that a broader role in the carcinogenesis of extrauterine pelvic serous carcinoma was suggested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-serous-carcinomas/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. The increasing interest in the role of STIC was based upon findings in women with <em>BRCA</em> gene mutations. Risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (rrBSO) is recommended for these women, and this practice became more common in the 1990s. This resulted in histologic evaluation of the fallopian tubes in women with no apparent ovarian lesion. Further, use of extensive sectioning of the tubes has allowed better diagnosis of these lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-serous-carcinomas/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

One small retrospective study found tubal hyperplasia or dysplasia only in women with <em>BRCA1</em> mutations who underwent rrBSO and not in women who had a salpingectomy for benign gynecologic disease (rrBSO: 11 of 12; benign surgery: 0 of 13) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-serous-carcinomas/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. At our institution, we evaluate all tubal specimens with transverse sectioning at 2 to 3 mm (sectioning and extensively examining the fimbrial end [SEE-FIM]). Since 2005, using this protocol, six incidental STICs have been found in women without an ovarian carcinoma, for a frequency of approximately 1:700 in women over age 50 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-serous-carcinomas/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most cases of serous tubal intraepithelial neoplasia are found in the distal fallopian tube or fimbriated end of the tube, coinciding with the region in which some data suggest that most early tubal adenocarcinomas are found in asymptomatic women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-serous-carcinomas/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tubal intraepithelial <span class=\"nowrap\">neoplasia/STIC</span> and extrauterine pelvic serous carcinoma in the same patient often show identical <em>TP53</em> mutations, implying a common origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-serous-carcinomas/abstract/5,24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,24,25</a>].</p><p/><p>Tubal intraepithelial <span class=\"nowrap\">neoplasia/STIC</span> is the earliest potentially clinically significant serous neoplasm of the upper female reproductive tract (ovary or fallopian tubes) that has been identified. The risk that this neoplasm will develop into an invasive tubal carcinoma or spread to the ovarian surface or pelvic peritoneum has not been determined. However, the rarity with which this entity is found in the absence of invasive carcinoma is noteworthy. It contrasts with the traditional image of cancer precursors (such as in the cervix) that accumulate due to their slow or incomplete transit to carcinoma and are thus much more prevalent than their invasive counterparts.</p><p>There have been occasional cases of recurrent extrauterine pelvic serous carcinoma reported in women with a prior finding of tubal intraepithelial <span class=\"nowrap\">neoplasia/STIC</span> on rrBSO. In our experience, only about 5 percent recur; which despite the rarity and malignant appearance of tubal intraepithelial <span class=\"nowrap\">neoplasia/STIC,</span> suggests there is an interval of unknown duration prior to invasion or spread.</p><p>On the other hand, tubal intraepithelial <span class=\"nowrap\">neoplasia/STICs</span> are found in association with 33 to 59 percent of cases of locally advanced or metastatic extrauterine pelvic serous carcinoma, irrespective of genetic risk (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F86931\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86931 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-serous-carcinomas/abstract/5,26-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,26-30</a>]. The presence of STIC in association with advanced stage disease implies that the STIC was discovered after acquiring properties that promoted spread to distant sites, specifically the ovarian and peritoneal surfaces. An alternative explanation is that STIC is produced by mucosal metastases from carcinomas originating elsewhere. In either case, the genetic link between STIC and adjacent carcinomas has been made by the finding of common <em>TP53</em> mutations in both sites.</p><p>Since the data regarding STIC derive mainly from women with <em>BRCA</em> mutations, some have proposed that this patient population may be more prone to oviductal carcinomas. This is difficult to study because the populations being sampled vary across institutions. Nevertheless, some experts have proposed that up to 30 percent of extrauterine pelvic serous carcinomas with a tubal origin will prove to be <em>BRCA</em> positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-serous-carcinomas/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Further study of this issue is needed. However, STINs in women who are not at high risk for developing ovarian cancer and undergoing surgeries for benign conditions have been documented [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-serous-carcinomas/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>]. Moreover, similar to those with germline <em>BRCA1</em> or <em>BRCA2</em> mutations, early high-grade serous carcinomas detected incidentally in the general population are virtually always found in the fallopian tubes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-serous-carcinomas/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>If tubal intraepithelial <span class=\"nowrap\">neoplasia/STIC</span> is ultimately found to be associated disproportionately with <em>BRCA</em> mutations, evaluation for this finding in tubal specimens may play a role in detection of mutations carriers. If a tubal intraepithelial <span class=\"nowrap\">neoplasia/STIC</span> is found following salpingectomy in a woman who has no known genetic risk, counseling regarding genetic testing of the patient could be provided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-serous-carcinomas/abstract/12-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-16</a>]. In our practice, we routinely examine the distal fallopian tube of all patients who undergo salpingectomy, whether for rrBSO or other indications. This is analogous to examining the cervix in all hysterectomies to exclude an occult cervical cancer. Given that the distal tube is another site vulnerable to developing neoplasm, we consider it a reasonable approach, and it is supported by recommendations for the pathologic exam of the fallopian tubes and ovaries in surgical pathology specimens.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H636620571\"><span class=\"h2\">Ovarian cortical inclusion cysts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A prominent hypothesis of the pathogenesis of epithelial ovarian carcinoma is &quot;incessant ovulation&quot;, which describes a process of repeated ovulation that induces oxidative damage to the ovarian cortex and eventually leads to malignant transformation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-serous-carcinomas/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Ovulation itself combined with ovarian surface adhesions is implicated in the incorporation of M&uuml;llerian epithelium into the ovarian cortex.</p><p>Inclusion cysts of the ovarian cortex, derived from these mechanisms, have been reported to express p53 when they occur in conjunction with serous ovarian carcinomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-serous-carcinomas/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. However, a direct molecular link between cortical inclusion cysts and serous carcinoma has not been established. Cortical inclusion cysts are more commonly observed in continuity with low grade serous tumors, including serous cystadenomas or cystadenofibromas. These entities merge gradually with borderline (atypical proliferative) serous tumors. Occasionally, high grade serous tumors are seen in continuity with these neoplasms, but this is considered an uncommon pathway to extrauterine pelvic serous carcinoma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H636620578\"><span class=\"h2\">Endometriosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endometriotic foci may be the origin of a small subset of serous ovarian carcinomas. Although this occurs most commonly with endometrioid carcinoma, occasional early serous carcinomas or mixed serous and endometrioid carcinomas arising within areas of endometriosis have been reported. Studies have linked mutation in <em>ARID1A</em> with endometrioid and clear cell carcinomas arising in endometriosis, although this gene does not appear linked to serous neoplasms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-serous-carcinomas/abstract/3,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,37</a>]. Larger studies are warranted to determine the true significance of endometriosis in serous carcinogenesis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H1391765200\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometriosis: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Associated outcomes'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H585879\"><span class=\"h1\">CHARACTERISTICS OF PELVIC SEROUS NEOPLASMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High grade and low grade pelvic serous carcinogenesis appear to occur through two independent pathways. This is true in the great majority of cases, although some evidence indicates that in rare instances, high grade serous carcinoma can develop from low grade carcinoma. In these cases, the high grade lesion typically lacks the characteristic <em>TP53</em> mutation and instead displays a similar <em>KRAS</em> mutation to the one found in the low grade carcinoma from which it originated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-serous-carcinomas/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H636620594\"><span class=\"h2\">High grade pelvic serous carcinoma</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H636620601\"><span class=\"h3\">Origins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High grade serous ovarian, fallopian tubal, and peritoneal carcinomas consist of a cell population that most closely resembles the epithelium of the fallopian tube. It is therefore believed to originate from M&uuml;llerian cells. Although the presence of the main cell types lining the fallopian tube, secretory and ciliated cells can be readily observed in well-differentiated carcinomas, high grade carcinomas tend to contain a predominantly secretory or non-ciliated population. This is consistent with other carcinoma types in which less differentiation means regression to a less mature cell type, in this case secretory cells. In most cases, high grade carcinomas are thought to represent rapid progression from foci of serous tubal intraepithelial neoplasia (STIN) or inclusion cysts, a process primarily driven by mutations of the <em>TP53</em> gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-serous-carcinomas/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>Historically, most high grade serous carcinomas associated with an ovarian mass were thought to have originated in the ovary. Based upon the available evidence, however, it appears that primary fallopian tubal carcinoma accounts for 35 to 64 percent of extrauterine pelvic serous carcinomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-serous-carcinomas/abstract/5,12,26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,12,26-28</a>].</p><p>Assigning a tissue of origin to an advanced stage high grade serous carcinoma is often a challenge. However, as a general rule of thumb, the following distinction may be followed:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the majority of the tumor is in the ovary and there are no precursors or early invasive lesions at other sites, ovarian origin is most likely.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If there is a bulky fallopian tubal tumor, a serous tubal intraepithelial neoplasm (STIC) is present, and there is minimal involvement of the ovary, primary tubal origin is assumed.

A subgroup of high grade endometrioid carcinomas have been shown to harbor <em>TP53</em> mutations, a finding previously mainly associated with serous carcinomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-serous-carcinomas/abstract/41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-43</a>]. In addition, this small group of carcinomas often shows strong and diffuse expression of other markers commonly up-regulated in serous carcinoma, such as <em>WT1</em> and <em>p16INK4</em>, in marked contrast to the heterogeneous expression pattern seen in low grade endometrioid carcinomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-serous-carcinomas/abstract/27,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,43</a>].<sup> </sup></p><p>The clinician can expect in most cases of high grade epithelial carcinoma to receive a diagnosis of either high grade serous carcinoma or mixed serous and endometrioid carcinoma. An alternative is simply &quot;high grade M&uuml;llerian carcinoma&quot;, which avoids the decision of separating endometrioid, serous, or transitional patterns and connotes a spectrum of disease that receives uniform treatment. </p><p>Regarding pathogenesis, it remains to be seen whether subtle differences in histologic type (endometrioid versus serous) for high grade carcinomas reflect differences in origin. One study reported that high grade serous carcinoma is more likely to be associated with tubal intraepithelial <span class=\"nowrap\">neoplasia/STIC</span> and involve both ovaries equally, whereas high grade endometrioid carcinoma has minimal relationship to tubal intraepithelial <span class=\"nowrap\">neoplasia/STIC</span> and tends to favor one ovary over the other [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-serous-carcinomas/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2660850\"><span class=\"h4\">Evaluation of rrBSO specimens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tubal intraepithelial <span class=\"nowrap\">neoplasia/STIC</span> has been found in many of the tubal specimens in women with a BRCA mutation related hereditary ovarian cancer syndrome. The risk of STIC in women with Lynch syndrome is unknown, although a proportion of ovarian cancers in these women are high grade serous carcinomas. More recent larger series of BRCA-positive women undergoing risk-reducing bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy (rrBSO) with complete examination of the fimbria report finding early carcinomas at a rate of between 1 and 10 percent, and 78 percent or more will involve the distal tubal mucosa (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F86928\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86928 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-serous-carcinomas/abstract/12-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-18</a>].</p><p>Both the ovarian and tubal specimens following rrBSO require careful examination for neoplasm. We use the sectioning and extensively examining the fimbrial end (SEE-FIM) protocol at our institution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-serous-carcinomas/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. If tubal intraepithelial <span class=\"nowrap\">neoplasia/STIC</span> is found and the pelvic washings are negative, conservative management is the usual choice. It is unclear whether a second procedure is needed for staging. </p><p>An issue that has challenged pathologists is the distinction of tubal intraepithelial <span class=\"nowrap\">neoplasia/STIC</span> from a lesser form of atypia that does not confer any risk of recurrence. Many atypias are minor, some of which might contain p53 mutations (p53 signatures). These may have an etiologic connection to cancer but are inconsequential in the removed tube, not unlike a low grade dysplasia of the cervix in a hysterectomy specimen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F86932\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86932 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-serous-carcinomas/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. However, some of these will be particularly expansile or border histologically on STIC and may cause some diagnostic uncertainty. These premalignant atypias have been termed tubal intraepithelial lesions in transition (TILTs), or simply TILs by some in the pathology community. The clinician must be aware of such lesions when the pathology report is indecisive. One solution to such difficulties is to have the tissue sections reviewed by multiple reviewers and to immunostain the lesion with markers of proliferation (MIB1) and p53 to confirm the presence of abnormal p53 staining and a high proliferative index. However ultimately, the decision is based on histologic criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-serous-carcinomas/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. As discussed above, the caregiver must be aware of the fact that approximately 5 percent of tubal intraepithelial <span class=\"nowrap\">neoplasia/STICs,</span> when found in isolation, will be followed by a recurrence. Importantly, the patient must be counseled that some women with BRCA mutations develop extrauterine pelvic serous carcinoma following a completely normal rrBSO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-serous-carcinomas/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

Nevertheless, the fact that over 80 percent of symptomatic high grade extrauterine pelvic serous carcinomas have already spread beyond the ovary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-serous-carcinomas/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>] demands a more critical and innovative look at extrauterine pelvic serous carcinoma prevention. Alternatives to more traditional approaches (such as periodic physical exam, ultrasound, or serologic testing) merit study, and the concept of targeted prevention, in which one or more steps of early carcinogenesis are interrupted, is an attractive concept.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2660518\"><span class=\"h4\">Assigning primary tumor site</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The assignment of primary site has little clinical relevance, since high grade serous carcinomas arising in the ovary, tube, or peritoneum have the same clinical behavior and treatment. Traditionally, there have been criteria to distinguish between these carcinomas. However, many cases that were presumed to be ovarian carcinoma may have been incorrectly designated. Careful examination of the oviduct will reveal a STIC in approximately half of &quot;peritoneal&quot; serous carcinomas. This will not alter the management, but would be an indication for genetic testing.</p><p>Peritoneal carcinoma (previously referred to as primary peritoneal serous carcinoma) has long been a diagnosis of exclusion. Serous carcinomas involving the peritoneum and primarily serosal surfaces of the tubes and ovaries have been designated as peritoneal out of a lack of better choice for a primary site. However, other than occasional cases arising from pelvic endometriosis, no precursor lesion has been identified, and recent studies suggest that up to 50 percent might originate in the fallopian tube. This is further support for the all-encompassing term &quot;extrauterine pelvic serous carcinoma&quot;, which avoids the use of potentially inappropriate assignment of tumor origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-serous-carcinomas/abstract/26,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,29</a>]. </p><p>Thus, careful examination of the fallopian tubes with attention to the fimbria is required for all cases of extrauterine pelvic serous carcinoma. In our practice, we have developed the SEE-FIM protocol for this evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-serous-carcinomas/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

However, a recent study, in addition to validating the results in <em>BRCA</em> mutation carriers (in 7 of 17 patients, 41 percent), did show an effect in an albeit smaller percentage of sporadic high grade serous carcinoma (11 of 43 patients, 24 percent), which may have been the result of the larger sample size or due to the specific selection of high grade serous and undifferentiated carcinomas in this study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-serous-carcinomas/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].

However, low grade and borderline tumors display ciliated differentiation, indicating that the cell of origin is capable of ciliogenesis.

These inclusions have been postulated to arise from the mesothelial surface lining through either transdifferentiation or direct transfer from the distal fallopian tube. (See <a href=\"#H636620571\" class=\"local\">'Ovarian cortical inclusion cysts'</a> above.)</p><p>The presence of ovarian stroma and a subsequent epithelial-stromal interaction appears to be integral to carcinogenesis. A large percentage of low grade neoplasms acquire either KRAS or <em>BRAF</em> mutations during their development, which are not typically present in high grade serious carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-serous-carcinomas/abstract/54-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">54-57</a>]. <em>BRAF</em> mutations at codon 600 occur in approximately 30 percent of low grade serous carcinomas and 28 percent of serous borderline tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-serous-carcinomas/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].

Thus, <em>KRAS</em> mutations may be more important in the initiation of progressive disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-serous-carcinomas/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p>Another group of genes that are thought to play a role in the transformation of ectopic M&uuml;llerian epithelium in the ovaries are the homeobox regulatory (<em>HOX</em>) genes. During the development of the female genital tract, <em>HOX</em> genes are differentially expressed throughout the M&uuml;llerian epithelium, but in adults, the different members become site specific, with <em>HOXA9</em> expression found in the fallopian tubes, <em>HOXA10</em> in the uterus, <em>HOXA11</em> in the lower uterine segment, and <em>HOXA13</em> in the upper vagina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-serous-carcinomas/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].

Strongly positive or completely absent p53 staining corresponds to inactivation of <em>TP53</em>, hence high grade serous carcinoma. The latter (complete loss of staining) is explained by deletion of the portion of p53 that encodes the protein that is recognized by the antibody. This is equivalent to inactivation by point mutation.</p><p>Multiple studies have reported on the relative chemoresistance of low grade ovarian carcinoma compared to high grade carcinoma. Response rates for all extrauterine pelvic serous carcinomas (which, based on prevalence, mainly comprises high grade carcinomas) to platinum-based chemotherapy are approximately 26 percent when given as treatment for primary disease and 27 to 66 percent for recurring, established platinum-sensitive disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-serous-carcinomas/abstract/61-64\" class=\"abstract_t\">61-64</a>].<sup> </sup>In contrast, for solely low grade carcinomas, response rates of 4 percent for primary disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-serous-carcinomas/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>] and 4.9 percent for recurrent disease were reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-serous-carcinomas/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. These differences might theoretically be explained by the slower proliferation rate of low grade carcinoma, thus limiting the accumulation of platinum intercalation-induced DNA damage, but there is no direct molecular evidence of this. </p><p>It should be noted that resistance to chemotherapy does not translate directly to survival rates. Based upon their indolent growth pattern, low grade serous carcinomas have significantly longer progression-free survival rates than high grade lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-ovarian-fallopian-tubal-and-peritoneal-serous-carcinomas/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. </p><p>Chemoresponsiveness of ovarian, fallopian tubal, and peritoneal carcinomas is discussed in detail separately.

The prognostic value of peritoneal washings in case of a STIC diagnosis has not been clearly shown, but in our practice as pathologists, we advocate performing washings routinely at rrBSO.
