The superiority of revascularization compared with medical management in selected patients with coronary disease and LV dysfunction is compatible with this hypothesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dobutamine-stress-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-hibernating-myocardium/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. The myocardium that recovers function after revascularization has been called &quot;hibernating.&quot; To the extent that improvement in regional or global LV systolic function is a significant goal in such patients, the ability to accurately assess regional myocardial viability in a dysfunctional territory prior to revascularization becomes an important component of the decision making process (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F63612\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63612 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F70975\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef70975 \">algorithm 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F67744\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef67744 \">algorithm 2</a>).

The role of dobutamine stress echocardiography in the evaluation of myocardial viability in the setting of hibernation will be reviewed here. The use of other modalities in conjunction with dobutamine stress, such as Doppler studies, the relative efficacy of other imaging modalities (eg, radionuclide imaging, magnetic resonance imaging) for the detection of hibernating myocardium, and protocols for dobutamine stress echocardiography are discussed separately.

Viable myocardium shows improved global or regional contractile function (inotropic reserve), as assessed by simultaneous transthoracic echocardiography, in response to inotrope administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dobutamine-stress-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-hibernating-myocardium/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The prevalence of contractile reserve in patients with CHD and LV dysfunction is independent of the angiographic extent and severity of coronary artery disease, and the improvement in contractility in hypoperfused viable myocardium does not require an increase in regional myocardial perfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dobutamine-stress-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-hibernating-myocardium/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p>A contractile response to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a> appears to require that at least 50 percent of the myocytes in a given segment are viable; the contractile response also correlates inversely with the extent of interstitial fibrosis on myocardial biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dobutamine-stress-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-hibernating-myocardium/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. By comparison, radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging identifies segments with fewer viable myocytes. In one series, for example, dobutamine stress echocardiography and thallium imaging showed equivalent sensitivity among segments with more than 75 percent viable myocytes (78 versus 87 percent) but dobutamine stress echocardiography was much less sensitive among segments with 25 to 50 percent viable myocytes (15 versus 82 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dobutamine-stress-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-hibernating-myocardium/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>The predictive value of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a> stress echocardiography appears to be greatest when there is a biphasic response: improvement at low dose and worsening at high-dose dobutamine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dobutamine-stress-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-hibernating-myocardium/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. The initial improvement in wall motion reflects recruitment of contractile reserve during low-dose dobutamine, and hence reflects viability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dobutamine-stress-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-hibernating-myocardium/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. By comparison, higher doses lead to subendocardial ischemia and worsening of the wall motion abnormality, identifying stress-induced ischemia. Thus, testing at various doses appears to be important for the optimal assessment of myocardial hibernation by this technique.</p><p>The concurrent use of beta blockers at the time of the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a> stress echocardiogram can affect the response to dobutamine and reduce the number of viable segments detected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dobutamine-stress-echocardiography-in-the-evaluation-of-hibernating-myocardium/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

These drugs are relatively unaffected by concurrent use of a beta blocker.
