Rehabilitation includes a vast array of interventions provided by a diverse group of providers across the entire continuum of care. While rehabilitation may be provided to all age groups, the fastest-growing population of persons requiring rehabilitation services is adults over 65 years of age. This is because of the aging of the US and worldwide populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-program-components-and-settings-for-rehabilitation/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Improvements in both medical and rehabilitative care have helped to reduce prevalence of old age disability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-program-components-and-settings-for-rehabilitation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], but it comes with a substantive price in demands for both medical and rehabilitation care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-program-components-and-settings-for-rehabilitation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Moreover, there is concern that improvements in health and disability gained over the last several decades may not impact the generation just entering retirement. The increasing numbers in this population, and the apparent increases in disability related to musculoskeletal disorders (as well as depression, diabetes, and neurologic disorders), affecting mobility-related activities in particular, will likely further drive needs for rehabilitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-program-components-and-settings-for-rehabilitation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Making good use of rehabilitation resources is facilitated by an appreciation for how disability occurs and the mechanisms by which rehabilitation is effective. This knowledge leads to understanding of which specific rehabilitation services might best be provided, where to provide them, and who should provide them. This topic will review aspects of geriatric rehabilitation related to types of involved providers, interventions, and settings. Indications for rehabilitation and patient assessment are addressed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-patient-assessment-and-common-indications-for-rehabilitation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of geriatric rehabilitation: Patient assessment and common indications for rehabilitation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4419924\"><span class=\"h1\">CONCEPTUAL MODELS FOR DISABILITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two major conceptual models for understanding disability and where rehabilitation services can be most effective:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The International Classification of Function, Disability, and Health (ICF), developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-program-components-and-settings-for-rehabilitation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A model variably known as the &quot;Environmental Press,&quot; &quot;Ecological,&quot; or &quot;Person-Environment Fit&quot; model, originally described by Lawton [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-program-components-and-settings-for-rehabilitation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4419931\"><span class=\"h2\">The World Health Organization model (ICF)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The WHO ICF model (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F86412\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86412 \">figure 1</a>) indicates that an individual&rsquo;s level of function (body function, ability to execute a task [activity], and participate in life activities) is determined by his or her health condition(s) within the context of environmental and personal factors. Medical and surgical interventions are directed at the underlying health conditions causing disability; rehabilitation services target the impairment, activities, and participation levels of the disablement process, as well as personal and environmental contextual factors that influence activity and participation.</p><p>Multiple health conditions or comorbidities, with concomitant impairments, are common in older persons and influence the disablement process. Effective treatment of late-life disability, therefore, is typically multimodal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-program-components-and-settings-for-rehabilitation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Decline in late-life disability from 1980 to 2010 can be attributed to the combination of advances in medical care, improved socioeconomic factors, and innovations in mainstream and assistive technology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-program-components-and-settings-for-rehabilitation/abstract/3,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4419938\"><span class=\"h2\">The ecological model</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Disability results from a mismatch between individual capacity and task demands, which in turn are influenced by the environment and the way in which tasks are performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-program-components-and-settings-for-rehabilitation/abstract/7,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10</a>]. For example, walking imposes different physical demands when performed atop Mount Everest versus at sea level. Thus, the ecological model helps to explain how personal and particularly environmental contextual factors described in the WHO ICF model interact with physical limitations to result in disability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-program-components-and-settings-for-rehabilitation/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. In the ecological model, remediation of disability occurs through treatments that either increase individual capacity or reduce task demand.</p><p>Medical treatment (eg, oxygen supplementation or medication) or surgical treatment (eg, cataract surgery, joint replacement) have the potential to increase capacity. Rehabilitation interventions may improve capacity, reduce task demands, or accomplish both. Examples of such interventions follow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-program-components-and-settings-for-rehabilitation/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Improve capacity:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Exercise</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hearing aids, reading magnifiers</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Artificial limbs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Orthotics (ie, braces, splints)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduce task demands:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A raised toilet seat or bath bench, which reduce the effort required to rise to a standing position</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A ramp or elevator to replace stairs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Both increase capacity and reduce demand:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A cane that can enhance sensory capacity by providing proprioceptive feedback to improve balance and can reduce demand, for example, by offloading body weight from the leg to the arm to relieve arthritic joints or weak lower extremities</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4419952\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF REHABILITATION PROVIDERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Disability has many diverse causes and often occurs through the interaction of one or more medical conditions with both personal and environmental contextual factors. Therefore, a wide variety of providers may be involved in treating rehabilitation.</p><p>A list of types of rehabilitation providers, the typical rehabilitation interventions used by various disciplines, and the aspect(s) of the disablement process targeted by the provider types is provided in a table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F86413\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86413 \">table 1</a>). Treatment by a provider in a single discipline is often sufficient for patients with uncomplicated conditions or with minimal disability (eg, physical therapy for osteoarthritis of the knee or a home safety evaluation by an occupational therapist [OT] for a patient with fear of falling). However, for more complex or catastrophic disability, a multidisciplinary team of providers is optimal to address the rehabilitation needs related to progressive disability and the interaction of multiple contributing conditions and contextual factors.</p><p>Multidisciplinary care is a cornerstone of rehabilitation. The efficacy of coordinated multidisciplinary rehabilitation for a number of conditions affecting older adults, including stroke, rheumatoid arthritis, falls, and frailty, is supported by numerous studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-program-components-and-settings-for-rehabilitation/abstract/13-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-19</a>]. Geriatric evaluation and treatment units provide multidisciplinary care with medical, social service, nursing, and rehabilitation personnel (typically physical and occupational therapy) working together in a coordinated fashion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-program-components-and-settings-for-rehabilitation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Inpatient stroke rehabilitation teams include a variety of rehabilitation personnel (eg, speech therapy, occupational therapy, physical therapy) to target rehabilitation therapies to the specific stroke-related deficits, as well as medical, nursing, and other staff [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-program-components-and-settings-for-rehabilitation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Coordination of care may be achieved with weekly team meetings <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> scripted protocols to facilitate care coordination.</p><p>Benefits from coordinated multidisciplinary rehabilitation accrue from systematically targeting the multiple factors that interact to cause and exacerbate disability. For example, stroke may adversely affect visual perception, speech, and cognition as well as cause paralysis. Members of the multidisciplinary team often have both unique and overlapping expertise, reinforcing the interventions of each other.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4419959\"><span class=\"h1\">INTERVENTIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4419967\"><span class=\"h2\">Exercise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Physical activity is defined as bodily movement produced by skeletal muscle contraction that substantially increases energy expenditure. Exercise, a type of physical activity, is defined as a planned, structured, and repetitive bodily movement done to improve or maintain one or more components of physical fitness (eg, muscle strength, flexibility, balance).</p><p>Physical activity is beneficial for reducing overall morbidity and mortality in older adults (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F51565\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51565 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-program-components-and-settings-for-rehabilitation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Exercise recommendations for all individuals &gt;65 years of age are shown in a table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F82111\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82111 \">table 3</a>) and discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-activity-and-exercise-in-older-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical activity and exercise in older adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The physical activity recommendations intended for all older adults may need to be modified for particular medical disorders, using specific types of exercise to correct or ameliorate identified impairments and functional limitations. Common conditions in older adults that would necessitate exercise modification include acute cardiac conditions (eg, cardiac rehabilitation), orthopedic and neurosurgery procedures, osteoporosis, <span class=\"nowrap\">acute/postacute</span> stroke, or chronic respiratory disease (eg, pulmonary rehabilitation). Physical therapists (PTs), exercise physiologists, and physicians specializing in rehabilitation (&ldquo;physiatrists&rdquo;) can help to tailor the exercise prescription to meet particular patient needs.</p><p>Certain types of exercise may be particularly beneficial for specific patient populations. As an example, resistive exercise and power training have been found to improve function in frail older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-program-components-and-settings-for-rehabilitation/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. A systematic review found that progressive resistance exercise (ie, weightlifting) can significantly improve muscle strength and, to a lesser extent, functional activities such as rising from a chair and ambulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-program-components-and-settings-for-rehabilitation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>During acute hospitalization, early mobilization seems to offer particular benefit, improving outcomes in multiple patient populations, including patients with hip fracture, acute pneumonia, or critical illness in the intensive care unit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-program-components-and-settings-for-rehabilitation/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4419974\"><span class=\"h2\">Assistive technology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Assistive technology and adaptive methods encompass a diverse group of interventions designed to enable people with physical limitations to participate in a broad range of activities.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assistive technology refers to devices that may be used to make tasks easier or safer (eg, a reacher can be used by someone with limited upper- or lower-extremity range of motion to make it easier to pick something up).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adaptive methods refers to changing the way a task is done so as to make it safer or easier (eg, a stroke patient might don a sweater more easily by putting the sleeve on the paralyzed arm first, then on the non-paralyzed arm, and then over the head).</p><p/><p>Often the two methods are used together. These interventions can act at all levels of the disablement process, targeting particular organ system impairments (eg, a prosthetic leg after an amputation), particular types of activities (eg, a cane used when walking), or broadly enhancing access and opportunities for participation (eg, ramps allowing access to public buildings).</p><p>Assistive technology is a particularly common way of coping with disability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-program-components-and-settings-for-rehabilitation/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Assistive technology includes mobility aids such as canes and walkers, bathroom safety devices such as raised toilet seats and grab bars, self-care devices such as reachers and built-up utensils, as well sophisticated computerized and electronic technology. Use of assistive technology has been increasing substantially, far exceeding the growth and aging of the US population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-program-components-and-settings-for-rehabilitation/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. By some reports, technological advances may account for half of the decline in disability in the early 2000s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-program-components-and-settings-for-rehabilitation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. There has been both an increase in evidence to support its effectiveness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-program-components-and-settings-for-rehabilitation/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>] as well as major improvements in the technology itself, with improved ergonomics, ease of use, and durability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-program-components-and-settings-for-rehabilitation/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The internet provides a wealth of information about diverse assistive devices. <a href=\"http://www.abledata.com/&amp;token=M5TuNcCRE1LVuPlbMU+ELkczbvsb1ZDd+Z4hB19sHSevALUkLBSw0hah5bEtTSir&amp;TOPIC_ID=16852\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Abledata</a> is one such resource, providing objective information on assistive technology and rehabilitation equipment available from sources within the United States and internationally.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4419988\"><span class=\"h3\">Mobility aids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With the aging of the population, there is increasing need for mobility aids. In the United States in 2000, among adults 65 years and older, 10 percent used canes and 4.6 percent used walkers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-program-components-and-settings-for-rehabilitation/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Mobility devices may be used for diverse types of physical limitations affecting mobility, including weakness, sensory limitations (vision or proprioception), impaired balance, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> limited endurance. While such devices are intended to improve mobility, activity, foster independence, and provide some protection against falls, evidence from high-quality studies on the impact of these devices is sparse.</p><p>There are multiple options for mobility aids, and their appropriate use is outlined below. An algorithm for selecting among mobility aids and a table that reviews indications and the relative pros and cons of various mobility aids are provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F86446\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef86446 \">algorithm 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F86414\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86414 \">table 4</a>).</p><p>Despite availability of insurance coverage, many older adults purchase mobility aids over the counter on their own or borrow them from friends or relatives without professional guidance, which can lead to problems using the device [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-program-components-and-settings-for-rehabilitation/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Mobility aids that are not properly fit or are used incorrectly can increase the risk of falls and injury. Falls directly related to mobility devices account for over 50,000 visits annually to emergency departments in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-program-components-and-settings-for-rehabilitation/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Moreover, 30 to 50 percent of wheelchair users report tips and falls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-program-components-and-settings-for-rehabilitation/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. It is vital to observe older patients actually using their mobility aid to verify proper fit and correct use and to refer the patient to expert consultation with a certified Assistive Technology Provider (ATP), PT, or occupational therapist (OT) if there is any question.</p><p>Reimbursement issues in the United States are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"#H4131568930\" class=\"local\">'Reimbursement for mobility aids'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3285546\"><span class=\"h4\">Canes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Canes are the most commonly used type of mobility device [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-program-components-and-settings-for-rehabilitation/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. Most persons are not properly instructed in cane use, and up to 70 percent of canes are used incorrectly or are the wrong height or design [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-program-components-and-settings-for-rehabilitation/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. As a result, almost 30 to 50 percent of individuals abandon use of the cane after receiving it.</p><p>Typically, canes are used to reduce the weight borne across an arthritic joint, thereby reducing pain, or to assist with balance when the balance problem is due to impaired sensation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mild leg weakness. A cane can transmit proprioceptive input to the hand and arm, which can be helpful to people with neuropathic problems or visual deficit. Canes are lightweight and versatile but require good hand and arm strength and provide only minimal support. Canes are most useful when the gait problem is unilateral <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mild.</p><p>A variety of options are available in canes. For most patients, a simple cane with an ergonomic grip is most effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-program-components-and-settings-for-rehabilitation/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. A quad cane with four tips provides a broader base of support but is clumsier to use. A cane with a pistol grip handle can increase weight support.</p><p>The cane needs to be at the right height so as not to throw off balance and to provide proper biomechanical support, with the handle of the cane at the level of the wrist with the arm fully extended. Most canes can be adjusted by cutting the cane at the tip or, for adjustable canes, with the button on the side of the cane. Most canes have a rubber tip to improve traction that should be inspected for wear and replaced when worn.</p><p>A cane should be used in the hand opposite to the affected limb to preserve a normal gait pattern and keep the body weight over the base of support to ensure good balance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H176091046\"><span class=\"h4\">Crutches</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Like canes, crutches come with various options (eg, axillary, forearm, and platform crutches). However, as all crutches require excellent arm strength and coordination for effective use, they are seldom used with older patients. Improper use of crutches, especially the more common axillary crutches, can result in injury to the shoulder (eg, brachial plexopathy and rotator cuff tendinitis). There are several different ways to use crutches (eg, swing through gait, touch-down, etc) and most require learning a novel gait pattern, which can be challenging in the presence of even mild cognitive impairment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3285554\"><span class=\"h4\">Walkers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Walkers are the second most commonly used type of mobility aid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-program-components-and-settings-for-rehabilitation/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. Walkers generally are used to treat bilateral gait problems or when more body-weight support or balance support is needed than a cane can provide. Walkers come with many options in the number of wheels and type of support.</p><p>One of the most commonly used types of walker is a two-wheel or front-wheel walker. A four-point or pick-up walker is seldom used any more, as it is harder to use and offers little additional stability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-program-components-and-settings-for-rehabilitation/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Forearm supports can be attached to a two-wheel walker to enable use by persons with weak grip or hand deformities.</p><p>Increasingly common is a four-wheel walker with brakes located on the handles like a bicycle (sometimes called a &ldquo;rollator&rdquo; or &ldquo;Canadian walker&rdquo;). Four-wheel walkers come with and without a seat and with or without a basket. A four-wheel walker is less stable than a two-wheel walker. It requires good hand coordination to use the brakes and is more expensive than a two-wheel walker; but it is more maneuverable, and the seat affords an opportunity to rest at will. It is a good choice for someone whose main problem is poor endurance from pain or shortness of breath (such patients often have the necessary balance and hand coordination to safely use this type of walker, and the seat allows for rest breaks). A three-wheel walker can provide similar balance support as a four-wheel walker, but it is lighter weight and more maneuverable so it is particularly useful for patients dealing with mobility in narrow confines (eg, a trailer) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-program-components-and-settings-for-rehabilitation/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]; however, it is does not come with a seat or basket, so it is less useful for people with limited endurance or who need to transport items while walking (eg, shopping).</p><p>A &quot;Merry Walker&quot; has four wheels, a sling seat, and railings on four sides so that the patient is protected from falling yet can propel themselves. The Merry Walker is larger than other walkers and is best used in an institutional setting with wide <span class=\"nowrap\">doorways/hallways</span>.</p><p>A &quot;Knee Walker&quot; is a relatively new wheeled mobility device. It is similar to the foot-propelled or kick scooters used by children but with a platform on which the patient can rest their knee while walking. It is especially useful for people who must be non-weightbearing after surgery or injury to the foot or ankle as it is easy to use and it avoids the need for a wheelchair or crutches.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3285569\"><span class=\"h4\">Wheelchairs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Wheelchairs may be used when weightbearing is prohibited or in patients with significant functional impairments (eg, bilateral leg weakness, impaired balance, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> motor coordination too severely impaired for safe use of a walker). The most commonly used wheelchair is a manual wheelchair with a sling seat that folds and has removable footrests and armrests.</p><p>Many older individuals pay for wheelchairs and other assistive devices themselves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-program-components-and-settings-for-rehabilitation/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>] and may be tempted to save money by use of non-removable foot rests or by using a second-hand wheelchair. Fixed foot rests are a fall hazard and make it harder to get in and out of the chair and should be avoided. Borrowing a wheelchair can be problematic if the fit is not adequate or the seat is worn, reducing comfort and increasing the risk of pressure ulcers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-program-components-and-settings-for-rehabilitation/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>Important aspects of wheelchair fit for all wheelchair users include seat width and height. The seat width should allow about one inch between the thighs and the armrests, such that there is no pressure or rubbing on the lateral thighs while still allowing good biomechanics when propelling the chair. The seat length should allow about two inches between the end of the seat and the knees, and the foot rests are positioned so the thighs are slightly elevated or level such that the seat provides even support to the buttocks and thighs. Patients who use their feet to propel the wheelchair (eg, stroke patients) require a &quot;hemi-height&quot; wheelchair with a seat height that is lower to the ground. A seat cushion generally should be used with a wheelchair and a specialized pressure-reducing cushion is appropriate for persons in the wheelchair full-time or who have difficulty with limited ability to shift their weight while seated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-program-components-and-settings-for-rehabilitation/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>].

Careful consideration of medical comorbidities and the premorbid functional status is required, particularly in older persons. Such factors may be of lesser importance for younger patients with traumatic amputation.</p><p>Lower-extremity amputations are the second most common type of amputation (with digit amputation most common), and up to 90 percent are due to peripheral vascular disease in diabetic patients. The underlying disease that resulted in an amputation (eg, diabetes, peripheral vascular disease) often affects the function of other organ systems and the patient&rsquo;s ability to cope with the increased work of walking required with a prosthesis. Comorbid conditions such as cognitive impairment, arthritis, pulmonary disease, or stroke can also affect the use of a prosthesis. A systematic review noted that the following factors were most predictive of functional walking ability after a prosthetic limb: cognition, fitness, preoperative mobility, ability to stand on one leg, and independence in activities of daily living [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-program-components-and-settings-for-rehabilitation/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p>Anything that affects the biomechanical integrity of a joint will increase the work of walking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-program-components-and-settings-for-rehabilitation/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].&nbsp;While some newer prosthetic limbs come close to the efficiency of a normal leg, in general the higher the amputation the greater the increase in the work of walking. Patients with concomitant heart or lung disease, or other comorbid conditions that impact the functionality of the remaining lower limb, may not be able to meet the added work of walking with a prosthetic limb. For some severely debilitated amputees, a manual or power wheelchair with a cosmetic leg may provide the best functional outcome. For other amputees, functional needs may be met with a low-tech prosthesis, such as a simple knee or ankle joint, rather than a computerized knee or multiaxial ankle joint. By contrast, those with an above-knee amputation who are likely to be able to ambulate in the community may benefit from a high-tech prosthesis with a computerized knee [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-program-components-and-settings-for-rehabilitation/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. Determining the best type of prosthetic limbs for an individual patient depends not only on the level of the amputation but also on the presence of other medical conditions. For those clinical reasons, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) in the United States has created &ldquo;K-levels&rdquo; that identify the rehabilitation potential for someone with a lower-extremity amputation, and those levels in turn determine the type of prosthetic limb covered by CMS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F97254\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97254 \">table 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-program-components-and-settings-for-rehabilitation/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].</p><p>A multidisciplinary amputee clinic including a physiatrist, a PT, and a prosthetist is the optimal resource for determining the proper prosthesis and assuring correct fit and function. If this is not available, it is vital for the ordering clinician to work closely with a certified prosthetist and include a PT early in the process. In general, obtaining proper prosthetic fit and function requires a skilled prosthetist. Unfortunately, there is limited research available to assist in determining the optimal prosthesis for an individual patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-program-components-and-settings-for-rehabilitation/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. Prosthetic training is typically completed on an outpatient basis by a PT who may then work with the prosthetist to modify the prosthesis if abnormal gait patterns or skin breakdown are noted; ideally, there are intermittent evaluations and supervision by a physiatrist skilled in amputee rehabilitation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1174941\"><span class=\"h4\">Orthoses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Orthoses (ie, splints and braces) are available for virtually every joint in the body including the spine. There are a number of prefabricated, &quot;off the shelf&quot; orthoses (eg, carpal tunnel splints, soft cervical collar).

The effect of commonly used modalities for delivering heat and cold is at the superficial level of the body; core temperature is altered very little by localized thermal modalities. Ultrasound, particularly low-frequency ranges, is used to heat deeper tissues (up to several cm in depth). Heating modalities include heating <span class=\"nowrap\">pads/hydrocollator</span> packs, heat lamps, hot <span class=\"nowrap\">tub/whirlpool,</span> paraffin baths (paraffin mixed in <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mineral-oil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mineral oil</a> heated to 45 to 54&deg;C), and ultrasound (0.5 to 3.0 MHz).

Face-to-face evaluation by a clinician or midlevel provider and substantive medical justification is required by CMS for power mobility devices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-program-components-and-settings-for-rehabilitation/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>].</p><p>Some medical supply stores and vendors employ a certified ATP especially for provision of complex devices (eg, power wheelchairs). <span class=\"nowrap\">Medicare/CMS</span> covers consultation with an OT or PT for fitting and training in use of any type of durable medical equipment, including mobility aids.</p><p>The VHA will also cover most types of mobility aids and without some of the restrictions in the Medicare system (eg, more than one type of mobility aid may be provided for a particular medical problem so long as it is medically necessary), although medical justification by a VHA medical provider is required and training in use of the device by a VHA rehabilitation provider is also usually required.</p><p>Typically, Medicare will pay for rental of a standard manual wheelchair, with the patient owning the wheelchair after 13 months of rental [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-program-components-and-settings-for-rehabilitation/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>].

This is particularly important for older adults, as they are vulnerable to adverse effects from care transitions and often require care in multiple settings over the course of illness and recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-program-components-and-settings-for-rehabilitation/abstract/109\" class=\"abstract_t\">109</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18332847\"><span class=\"h2\">Postacute hospital rehabilitation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A common critical decision for inpatient providers is determining the type of setting in which postacute rehabilitation will be delivered.

Tele-rehabilitation may use a variety of technologies for remote delivery or rehabilitative services. Such technologies include eHealth, which uses internet-based technology for provision of health care (eg, video visits) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> heath informatics, and mHealth, which refers to use of health applications on mobile devices. These technologies may be used to provide remote monitoring, remote measurement, synchronous (ie, real-time) and asynchronous (ie, store and forward) audiovisual communications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-program-components-and-settings-for-rehabilitation/abstract/110-112\" class=\"abstract_t\">110-112</a>].</p><p>Multiple factors are to be considered when determining an appropriate location for postacute rehabilitation for a particular geriatric patient.

Under the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) guidelines, 60 percent of patients admitted to an IRF must have 1 of 13 medical diagnoses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F86417\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86417 \">table 11</a>). These guidelines therefore influence the availability of beds and acceptance of particular patients referred for IRF care.</p><p>Diagnoses that often warrant a higher level of postacute care (ie, intensive rehabilitation in an IRF) include stroke, spinal cord injury, and traumatic brain injury. General orthopedic patients (eg, patients recovering from hip fracture, ischemic amputation, or total joint replacement) may not gain particular benefit from intensive rehabilitation and may recover function just as well with rehabilitation in a subacute or skilled nursing facility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-program-components-and-settings-for-rehabilitation/abstract/113-115\" class=\"abstract_t\">113-115</a>]; each patient should be evaluated individually to determine their most appropriate postacute rehabilitation setting. Frailty in patients with hip fracture or ischemic amputation may limit their ability to tolerate more intensive rehabilitation, while patients with an elective total joint replacement may have good general health and be able to rehabilitate with home health therapy followed by therapy in an outpatient facility. By contrast, patients with traumatic amputation often have other concomitant injuries requiring intensive rehabilitation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18333177\"><span class=\"h3\">Optimal level of postacute rehabilitation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Even within groups of patients who can benefit from intensive postacute inpatient rehabilitation, a variety of considerations are important when determining the optimal level of postacute care. The following describes some key considerations across most diagnostic groups that pertain to determining the optimal level of postacute rehabilitation.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Prehospital and current functional abilities</strong> &ndash; Information about functional abilities may be obtained from PT <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> OT evaluations and from the nursing service, although a history of prehospital function is best obtained from the <span class=\"nowrap\">patient/family</span> directly. <span class=\"nowrap\">PT/OT</span> consultations should be made early on during an acute hospitalization. This will help to ensure optimal clinical outcomes and allow sufficient time for the evaluation, equipment to be obtained if needed, and the patient trained in its use.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Therapy assessments should include an evaluation of ambulatory function and the patient&rsquo;s ability to perform basic activities of daily living (ADLs) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F66451\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66451 \">table 12</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F63647\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63647 \">table 13</a>). At a minimum, it should be determined whether the patient is independent or requires assistance from another person. For example, most individuals who resided in a nursing home setting prehospitalization will return to a nursing home, as it is unlikely they would make sufficient functional gains to become independent again and would be unlikely to have an independent living situation to return to after rehabilitation. Rehabilitation for such patients would best be met in a SNF&ndash;level setting, rather than in an IRF or with a home health service.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Medical stability</strong> &ndash; Medical stability assists in determining both the patient&rsquo;s ability to participate in therapy while in the hospital and the type of postacute setting needed after discharge. Inpatient rehabilitation facilities have physicians on staff to see patients daily and treat complex rehabilitation medical problems (eg, spasticity, autonomic dysreflexia); by contrast, a SNF has skilled nurses on staff to monitor patients' conditions and provide skilled nursing services with intermittent support (eg, once weekly) from medical staff who typically have general expertise in geriatric medicine. Thus, patients with active medical problems requiring close physician and nursing care are best discharged to either a long-term acute care hospital or an inpatient rehabilitation facility. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cognition</strong> &ndash; Participation in therapy is dependent, at a minimum, on the ability to follow one-step commands and to sufficiently recall so that learning is possible and therapists are not repetitively instructing the same task. Therapeutic goals are constrained when such abilities aren&rsquo;t present, with interventions limited to recommendations for equipment, environmental modifications, and caregiver training to enhance safety with functional tasks (eg, ambulation and bathing) and caregiver training on interventions to help maintain <span class=\"nowrap\">physical/functional</span> abilities (eg, range of motion exercises, proper use of splints and braces).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Therapy tolerance and motivation</strong> &ndash; While rehabilitation therapy in and of itself can help reduce depression and restore confidence, patients must be willing to participate. The patients&rsquo; motivation may be gleaned from their participation and motivation during therapy sessions in the acute hospital setting and their willingness to work with nursing staff during daily care. Tolerance for the more intensive therapy program required in an IRF (three hours of therapy per day, five days per week) also may be inferred from patient participation with <span class=\"nowrap\">PT/OT</span> during their acute hospitalization.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Types of needed therapy services</strong> &ndash; Patients discharged to an IRF must have a demonstrated need for at least two therapy disciplines (ie, <span class=\"nowrap\">PT/OT/speech</span> therapy). These services may be offered in other settings, but anticipated use of these therapies is not a requirement for admission to other settings.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Psychosocial factors</strong> &ndash; Social support, financial <span class=\"nowrap\">resources/insurance,</span> and personal preference (eg, facility close to home) are important considerations in determining the best location for postacute rehabilitation.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H255801109\"><span class=\"h3\">Reimbursement (United States)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medicare uses a prospective payment&quot; for rehabilitation in many postacute settings, for which a predetermined amount is provided for particular diagnoses, with consideration for the severity of the condition and comorbid conditions (eg, mild stroke versus severe stroke with diabetes and hypertension). Social workers can often provide helpful information about available payment rates.</p><p>A general example of these considerations for a stroke patient are as follows: Medicare prospective payment for intensive inpatient rehabilitation after an acute stroke (without additional comorbid conditions) is approximately 12 to 14 days. By contrast, the same stroke patient may receive up to 100 days of therapy (20 days at 100 percent coverage and 80 days at 80 percent coverage) in an SNF. Thus, if the patient is likely to benefit from prolonged therapy, but at a lower intensity, a skilled nursing home for rehabilitation might be the best choice.</p><p>Prospective payment is also in place for home health services. In that setting, a stroke patient might receive three weeks of therapy (physical therapy, occupational therapy, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> speech therapy) up to three times per week with another one to two weeks with less frequent visits per week. Preceding treatment in an inpatient setting does not preclude payment for home health therapies or outpatient therapies after discharge home.</p><p>In all three of these settings (inpatient rehabilitation, skilled nursing, home health), the patient must require &quot;skilled&quot; services to qualify for Medicare payment. For home health coverage in particular, a single visit by an OT (eg, for a home safety and falls assessment) would not be covered. Home health aide services, in the absence of other skilled nursing or therapy series, would also not be reimbursed. In addition, home health services are only covered for &quot;homebound&quot; patients, defined as being unable to leave home except for medical care and infrequent nonmedical reasons such as to go to religious services; the ordering physician must have had a face-to-face visit with the patient in the preceding 30 days and document this [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-program-components-and-settings-for-rehabilitation/abstract/116\" class=\"abstract_t\">116</a>].</p><p>Outpatient rehabilitation services continue to be paid for by Medicare as &quot;fee for service,&quot; but the total number of visits for all conditions are limited (to a total of <span class=\"nowrap\">$1870/year</span> for PT plus speech therapy with an additional <span class=\"nowrap\">$1870/year</span> for OT in 2012). These limits may be exceeded for some medically necessary therapies with appropriate justification from the medical provider <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> when provided in hospital emergency departments or outpatient departments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-geriatric-rehabilitation-program-components-and-settings-for-rehabilitation/abstract/117,118\" class=\"abstract_t\">117,118</a>]. There is no requirement for &quot;skilled services&quot; by physical therapy or nursing for outpatient therapy services to be covered.</p><p>Medicaid also covers rehabilitation services with variation from state to state. The Veterans Health Administration (VHA) provides rehabilitation throughout the continuum of care with either no charge for services or a modest copay (depending on level of service connection <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> finances).</p><p>Use of audiovisual telehealth technologies for delivery of rehabilitation (telehealth) is covered through the VHA, and video-based care is covered by Medicaid in 48 states and in Washington, DC. However, Medicare reimbursement for telehealth is limited and does not include most rehabilitation services.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2267440\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A model from the World Health Organization (WHO) describes disability as determined by an individual&rsquo;s health condition(s) within the context of environmental and personal factors; rehabilitation services target the impairment as well as personal and environmental contextual factors that influence activity and participation. In another model, disability results from a mismatch between individual capacity and task demands; remediation of disability occurs through treatments that either increase individual capacity or reduce task demand. (See <a href=\"#H4419924\" class=\"local\">'Conceptual models for disability'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rehabilitation treatment by a provider in a single discipline is often sufficient for patients with uncomplicated conditions or with minimal disability. For more complex or catastrophic disability (eg, stroke, amputation), a multidisciplinary team of providers as part of inpatient rehabilitation is optimal to address the interaction of multiple contributing conditions and contextual factors. (See <a href=\"#H4419952\" class=\"local\">'Types of rehabilitation providers'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The physical activity recommendations intended for all older adults may need to be adapted to meet particular needs, using specific types of exercise to correct or ameliorate identified impairments and functional limitations. Physical therapists (PTs), exercise physiologists, and physicians specializing in rehabilitation (&quot;physiatrists&quot;) can help to tailor the exercise prescription to meet particular patient needs. (See <a href=\"#H4419967\" class=\"local\">'Exercise'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An increasing variety of patient assistive technology aids can improve capacity for activity <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> reduce task demands, but they can be hazardous if not used properly. PTs and occupational therapists (OTs) can provide prescription guidance as well as fitting and training in use of these devices to enhance functional benefits and safety. Mobility aids (canes, crutches, walkers, wheelchairs) meet different needs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F86414\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86414 \">table 4</a>) and, in the United States, are variably reimbursed depending upon insurance and the patient&rsquo;s qualifying illness. (See <a href=\"#H4419988\" class=\"local\">'Mobility aids'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4131568930\" class=\"local\">'Reimbursement for mobility aids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Orthoses (ie, splints and braces) are available for virtually every joint in the body including the spine; prefabricated splints and braces are most appropriate for uncomplicated conditions that don&rsquo;t have substantial deformity. A multidisciplinary team including a PT, prosthetist, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> physiatrist can provide guidance and fitting as may be needed for more complex devices such as a prosthetic limb. (See <a href=\"#H4420002\" class=\"local\">'Prosthetics and orthotics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>OTs have particular expertise on the self-care skills, person-environment interface within the home environment, and can recommend the most beneficial assistive devices and home modifications; PTs are particularly helpful with mobility impairments and equipment, as well as exercise interventions to treat physical impairment; speech therapists have expertise in treatment of impaired speech and swallowing; low-vision specialists provide unique expertise for older adults coping with low vision; and a variety of other specialized personnel may provide rehabilitation care in particular settings (eg, recreational therapists, rehabilitation nursing). (See <a href=\"#H4420009\" class=\"local\">'Environmental modification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rehabilitation therapy services can be delivered in a wide variety of settings across the care continuum. Early mobilization, beginning postoperative day 1, the day of admission, or while in the intensive care unit (ICU) and still on a ventilator, can shorten length of stay and improve functional outcomes. Involvement of PT and OT is a necessary component of hospital discharge planning, particularly for older adults, in patients for whom there is concern about the ability to return home (eg, limitations in self-care or mobility are present). The options and considerations when considering continued rehabilitation upon discharge from the acute hospital setting are summarized in a table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F86677\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86677 \">table 10</a>).
