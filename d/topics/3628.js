These disorders are classified together because of similar clinical, radiographic, physiologic, or pathologic manifestations. </p><p>Although some of the conditions that cause DLD in children and adults are similar, they occur in different proportions in each age group, and certain diseases are unique to infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-diffuse-lung-disease-interstitial-lung-disease-in-infants-and-children/abstract/1-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-6</a>]. Historically, the approach to DLD in children has been patterned after nomenclature and prognosis in adults (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-interstitial-lung-disease-clinical-evaluation#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with interstitial lung disease: Clinical evaluation&quot;, section on 'Classification'</a>), and such practice has unfortunately created a great deal of confusion. There are important differences in disease etiology and natural history in the pediatric age group as compared with adults, and the classification of the idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIP) used in adults is overall a poor fit for childhood DLD. Prominent examples of these differences are idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and desquamative interstitial pneumonia (DIP). Specifically, IPF, a common IIP in adults that has a very poor prognosis, does not occur in children. Furthermore, pediatric cases of DIP tend to have relatively high mortality and have been associated with <em>ABCA3</em> and <em>SFTPC</em> mutations, which contrasts with the association between DIP and tobacco smoking and relatively good prognosis in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-diffuse-lung-disease-interstitial-lung-disease-in-infants-and-children/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. </p><p>In addition, there are forms of DLD that are either unique to young children or have differing manifestations as compared with adults. In the past 10 to 15 years, several new entities have been described in infants and young children, including neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia of infancy (NEHI) and pulmonary interstitial glycogenosis (P.I.G). A great advance has been the recognition and identification of genetic defects of surfactant function, metabolism, and clearance as causes of DLD, including mutations in the genes producing surfactant protein B (<em>SFTPB</em>), surfactant protein C (<em>SFTPC</em>), member A3 of the ATP binding cassette family of transporters (<em>ABCA3</em>), components of the GM-CSF receptor (<em>CSF2RA</em>), and <em>NKX2.1</em> (thyroid transcription factor-1). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-disorders-of-surfactant-dysfunction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic disorders of surfactant dysfunction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For all of these reasons, a classification system has been developed specifically for pediatrics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-diffuse-lung-disease-interstitial-lung-disease-in-infants-and-children/abstract/7,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10</a>]. The classification of DLD in infants and children will be discussed here. The approach to the infant and child with DLD is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-infant-and-child-with-diffuse-lung-disease-interstitial-lung-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the infant and child with diffuse lung disease (interstitial lung disease)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1049650497\"><span class=\"h1\">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term &quot;diffuse lung disease&quot; (DLD) describes a diverse group of disorders that involve the pulmonary parenchyma and interfere with gas exchange. This term reflects the spectrum of underlying pathology, which often includes extensive alteration of alveolar and airway architecture, in addition to changes in the interstitial compartment. These disorders have traditionally been described as &quot;interstitial lung disease&quot; (ILD), but that term is less accurate because the interstitium is not involved in some types, such as neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia of infancy. Another term used in the literature is &quot;diffuse parenchymal lung disease&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-diffuse-lung-disease-interstitial-lung-disease-in-infants-and-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p>The terms childhood ILD syndrome (chILD) or DLD syndrome are sometimes used to describe a case in which DLD is suspected based on clinical and radiologic features but a specific cause has not yet been established. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H617574402\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The terminology and classification system used to describe DLD in children is based on both clinical characteristics and histopathology, and emphasizes unique disorders in young children. It is important to recognize that classification does not necessarily provide a specific diagnosis, but instead is a framework for approaching the diverse groups of disorders that comprise childhood DLD. Therefore, the classification categories are used to group disorders with similar clinical characteristics <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pathophysiology. </p><p>Age at presentation is a key organizing principle of this classification structure. The classification is broadly divided into &quot;Disorders more prevalent in infancy&quot; and &quot;Disorders not specific to infancy&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90987\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90987 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-diffuse-lung-disease-interstitial-lung-disease-in-infants-and-children/abstract/7,10,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10,12</a>]. </p><p>Within this classification it is also useful to distinguish between DLD that is primarily a pulmonary-specific process and forms that occur in association with a systemic disorder (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90993\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90993 \">table 2</a>). For types of DLD that have no recognized causes and are not associated with a systemic disease, histopathologic patterns remain an important component of classification (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90994\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90994 \">table 3</a>). These histologic classifications are discussed in a separate section below. (See <a href=\"#H617574507\" class=\"local\">'Implications of histopathologic patterns in childhood DLD'</a> below.) </p><p>Thus, the more current classification is recognized to have some conceptual and practical limitations, but provides a very useful framework for this field. It is anticipated that the classification system will continue to undergo revision, including a need to better incorporate advances in the understanding of disease mechanisms including genetic mechanisms, improved recognition of radiographic patterns enabling noninvasive diagnosis, and other ongoing studies in this field [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-diffuse-lung-disease-interstitial-lung-disease-in-infants-and-children/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H617574419\"><span class=\"h1\">DISORDERS MORE PREVALENT IN INFANCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of unique forms of DLD have been described in infants and neonates (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90992\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90992 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-diffuse-lung-disease-interstitial-lung-disease-in-infants-and-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. These entities represent more precise and mechanistic descriptions of disorders that were previously misidentified or categorized based on histologic patterns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-diffuse-lung-disease-interstitial-lung-disease-in-infants-and-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H617574425\"><span class=\"h2\">Diffuse developmental disorders</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H76308393\"><span class=\"h3\">Alveolar capillary dysplasia with misalignment of the pulmonary veins (ACD-MPV)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ACD-MPV is the primary entity in the category of diffuse developmental disorders. It is a rare developmental disorder of the lung that typically causes very early postnatal respiratory distress and persistent pulmonary hypertension. The presentation may overlap that of persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN), except that infants with ACD-MPV are typically unresponsive to supportive measures including mechanical ventilation and inhaled <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitric-oxide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">nitric oxide</a>. Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) may be required while pursuing the diagnostic evaluation. This condition is almost always lethal, though milder cases have been rarely identified, including some presenting outside the neonatal period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-diffuse-lung-disease-interstitial-lung-disease-in-infants-and-children/abstract/16-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-21</a>]. The majority of affected infants with ACD-MPV have additional malformations, most commonly cardiac (often hypoplastic left heart), gastrointestinal (intestinal malrotation and atresias), and renal abnormalities. Although ACD-MPV may be suspected clinically, the definitive diagnosis has been defined largely based on distinctive abnormalities of the pulmonary vasculature seen histologically at lung biopsy or autopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-diffuse-lung-disease-interstitial-lung-disease-in-infants-and-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. A subset of newborns with ACD-MPV have <em>FOXF1</em> deletions or mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-diffuse-lung-disease-interstitial-lung-disease-in-infants-and-children/abstract/22-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-29</a>]. With sufficient clinical suspicion, early initiation of clinical genetic testing may obviate the need for lung biopsy and facilitate timely referral to a lung transplant center. Importantly, not all infants with ACD-MPV will have identified disruption of <em>FOXF1</em>, and it is likely that other genetic mechanisms also play a role. Somatic mosaicism may occur, emphasizing the role of genetic counseling for families with this disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-diffuse-lung-disease-interstitial-lung-disease-in-infants-and-children/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H617574431\"><span class=\"h2\">Lung growth disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While not traditionally considered a classic form of DLD, abnormalities of lung growth represent a prominent proportion of infants with DLD who undergo lung biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-diffuse-lung-disease-interstitial-lung-disease-in-infants-and-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Furthermore, the clinical features of tachypnea, retractions, hypoxemia, and diffuse radiographic abnormalities are often similar to those seen in other forms of childhood DLD. </p><p>Although lung growth abnormalities are predominantly considered in the context of prematurity and prenatal onset pulmonary hypoplasia (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and clinical features of bronchopulmonary dysplasia&quot;</a>), they also occur in the setting of congenital heart disease, chromosomal abnormalities (particularly trisomy 21), and sometimes in otherwise normal term infants with early postnatal lung injury. Radiologic findings are variable, depending on the etiology, age of the infant, and severity of the growth abnormality. Subpleural cysts may be present, and are frequently seen in pulmonary hypoplasia associated with trisomy 21 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-diffuse-lung-disease-interstitial-lung-disease-in-infants-and-children/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In one study, most infants diagnosed with lung growth abnormalities by lung biopsy had more severe clinical symptoms and radiographic abnormalities than would be expected for their known comorbidities or other clinical characteristics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-diffuse-lung-disease-interstitial-lung-disease-in-infants-and-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In these cases, the disproportionate clinical severity led to the suspicion for an additional form of DLD, and to the decision to pursue surgical lung biopsy in these patients. Pulmonary vascular disease or patchy pulmonary interstitial glycogenosis are common concurrent histologic findings in infants with these disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-diffuse-lung-disease-interstitial-lung-disease-in-infants-and-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>Several single gene disorders have been associated with DLD, best classified as lung growth abnormalities. Mutations or deletions in <em>NKX2.1</em> may present with alveolar simplification as the predominant finding, or alternatively with a phenotype of surfactant dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-diffuse-lung-disease-interstitial-lung-disease-in-infants-and-children/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Mutations in <em>FLNA</em> (filamin A) cause X-linked periventricular nodular heterotopia, and have also been associated with severe DLD with alveolar simplification and pulmonary hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-diffuse-lung-disease-interstitial-lung-disease-in-infants-and-children/abstract/34-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-37</a>]. <em>FLNA</em>-associated DLD has been suggested to have common radiologic patterns of upper lobe overinflation, coarse pulmonary lobular septal thickening, and lower lobe patchy atelectasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-diffuse-lung-disease-interstitial-lung-disease-in-infants-and-children/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. </p><p>Lung growth abnormalities are associated with considerable morbidity and mortality when compared with other causes of DLD. In one multicenter study, mortality was 34 percent for lung growth abnormality cases, a proportion similar to the entire study cohort. However, among the group with lung growth abnormalities, prematurity and pulmonary hypertension were independent clinical predictors of mortality. On lung biopsy, severe lung growth abnormality, as judged by degree of alveolar enlargement and simplification of the lobular architecture, was associated with a high mortality (80 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-diffuse-lung-disease-interstitial-lung-disease-in-infants-and-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. When lung biopsy is performed, proper tissue handling is essential, especially with respect to inflation of the biopsy sample, and expert pathologic review may be required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-diffuse-lung-disease-interstitial-lung-disease-in-infants-and-children/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H380176587\"><span class=\"h2\">Specific conditions of undefined etiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several other disorders that are unique to infants have undefined etiologies, but are considered specific conditions because of their distinct clinical characteristics:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H617573464\"><span class=\"h3\">Pulmonary interstitial glycogenosis (P.I.G.)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pulmonary interstitial glycogenosis (P.I.G.), previously known as cellular interstitial pneumonitis of infancy, was originally described in several infants who presented with tachypnea since birth and diffuse infiltrates of unknown etiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-diffuse-lung-disease-interstitial-lung-disease-in-infants-and-children/abstract/41-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-45</a>]. Lung biopsy demonstrated interstitial proliferation of bland, nondescript histiocytic type cells and minimal or no inflammation. Electron microscopy demonstrated that these interstitial cells contained monoparticulate glycogen, called &quot;pulmonary interstitial glycogenosis&quot; by the authors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-diffuse-lung-disease-interstitial-lung-disease-in-infants-and-children/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. In our clinical practice, we use the abbreviation &quot;P.I.G&quot; rather than the acronym PIG, which might have negative connotations to patients and their families. </p><p>This disorder only occurs in young infants, typically less than six months of age. The severity of the clinical presentation is highly variable, and can include neonatal respiratory failure with pulmonary hypertension, or more chronic tachypnea and hypoxemia. Complicating factors can include prematurity or congenital heart disease. </p><p>Case series have reported that chest radiographs have diffuse infiltrates or hazy opacities, but no common high-resolution CT scan pattern has been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-diffuse-lung-disease-interstitial-lung-disease-in-infants-and-children/abstract/43,46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,46,47</a>]. Lung biopsy is the only way to diagnose P.I.G. This disorder may occur as a diffuse isolated histologic entity, but is increasingly identified in a patchy distribution (termed 'patchy P.I.G.') in the setting of other pulmonary conditions, most commonly lung growth abnormalities, including pulmonary hypoplasia and chronic neonatal lung disease due to prematurity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-diffuse-lung-disease-interstitial-lung-disease-in-infants-and-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>The etiology of P.I.G. is unknown, though clearly related to lung development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-diffuse-lung-disease-interstitial-lung-disease-in-infants-and-children/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. There is no known definitive therapy. Case reports and case series have suggested possible benefits from high-dose pulse glucocorticoids, but no controlled studies have been performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-diffuse-lung-disease-interstitial-lung-disease-in-infants-and-children/abstract/43,49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,49,50</a>]. The possible benefits of glucocorticoids should be assessed in the context of the clinical severity and extent of histologic findings and weighed against the potential detrimental impact of glucocorticoids on postnatal alveolarization and neurodevelopment in this patient population. The clinical significance of the presence of patchy P.I.G. has been debated and role of empiric treatment is even less certain in patients with this histologic pattern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-diffuse-lung-disease-interstitial-lung-disease-in-infants-and-children/abstract/7,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,50</a>]. When comorbidities such as congenital heart disease or complications of prematurity are present, these problems are often the focus of management. </p><p>The natural history of P.I.G. is unknown. Case reports suggest that the prognosis is favorable in the absence of concurrent disease. Such infants may remain symptomatic for months, but generally improve over time. By contrast, mortality may be seen in infants with P.I.G. when other comorbidities are present, including lung growth abnormalities, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), congenital heart disease, or pulmonary hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-diffuse-lung-disease-interstitial-lung-disease-in-infants-and-children/abstract/7,50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,50,51</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H617573470\"><span class=\"h3\">Neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia of infancy (NEHI)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia of infancy (NEHI) is a rare disorder that presents in infants in the first months to year of life with chronic hypoxemia, retractions, and crackles. In patients with typical clinical findings, the diagnosis can be established by chest high-resolution computed tomography (HRCT), which shows relatively homogeneous ground-glass opacities in the right middle lobe, lingula, and central portions of the lung (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90984\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef90984 \">image 1</a>).

Before these molecular defects were discovered, infants with these disorders were categorized according to their histopathologic appearance, which can include pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP), chronic pneumonitis of infancy (CPI), desquamative interstitial pneumonia (DIP), nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), or nonspecific pulmonary fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-of-diffuse-lung-disease-interstitial-lung-disease-in-infants-and-children/abstract/57-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">57-60</a>].

Histopathologic patterns may include pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP), chronic pneumonitis of infancy (CPI), desquamative interstitial pneumonia (DIP), or nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP). (See <a href=\"#H617573476\" class=\"local\">'Genetic disorders of surfactant dysfunction'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Forms of DLD that are not specific to infancy include aspiration syndromes, bronchiolitis obliterans (which may be caused by viral infections, especially adenovirus, as well as noninfectious causes), and hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Immunocompromised hosts are particularly prone to DLD. Similarly, a number of systemic disorders may be associated with DLD, especially connective tissue diseases. Immune deficiencies and connective tissues diseases should be considered during the evaluation of a child with DLD, since DLD is occasionally a presenting feature of the systemic disease. (See <a href=\"#H158064327\" class=\"local\">'Disorders of the immunocompromised host'</a> above and <a href=\"#H617574475\" class=\"local\">'Disorders related to systemic disease processes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>DLD in which the specific cause is unknown is termed idiopathic DLD and classification is attempted on the basis of the histopathology (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90994\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90994 \">table 3</a>). Histopathologic patterns seen in children share some overlap with adult forms of the idiopathic interstitial pneumonias, but may have different etiologic implications. These include PAP, DIP and NSIP, as well as acute interstitial pneumonia (AIP), cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP), and lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia (LIP). Because each histopathologic pattern has been associated with certain causes of DLD or with underlying systemic disorders, identification of these patterns should prompt a focused evaluation for the underlying disorder. (See <a href=\"#H617574507\" class=\"local\">'Implications of histopathologic patterns in childhood DLD'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Histopathology of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) can be associated with different underlying disease processes. A congenital form may be caused by genetic disorders of surfactant dysfunction or of GM-CSF signaling, or lysinuric protein intolerance. In adults, and occasionally in older children and adolescents, PAP is usually an autoimmune disease. An acquired (secondary) form of PAP can be seen in children or adults in association with infections, hematologic malignancies, immune deficiencies, or exposure to inhaled chemicals. This histopathologic pattern, or finding of PAP on bronchoalveolar lavage, should prompt such investigations. (See <a href=\"#H10641782\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP)'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-alveolar-proteinosis-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Most cases of desquamative interstitial pneumonia (DIP) in children and chronic pneumonitis of infancy (CPI) are now recognized to be caused by inborn errors of surfactant metabolism.
