Facial clefts and holoprosencephaly (HPE) are conditions caused by the disruption of these normal embryonic processes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">FACIAL CLEFTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Facial clefts are deformations of the face <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cranium caused by relative excesses or deficits of tissue along linear anatomic planes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-clefts-and-holoprosencephaly/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Although the exact incidence of facial clefts is unknown, they are estimated to affect 1.4 to 4.9 newborns per 100,000 livebirths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-clefts-and-holoprosencephaly/abstract/1,3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Embryology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>More than one theory exists regarding the embryologic pathogenesis of facial clefts. Fetal craniofacial development is a complex series of events that occurs between the third and eighth weeks of gestation. During the initial stages, five facial processes (one frontal, two maxillary, two mandibular) form and subsequently fuse (by the sixth week of gestation) to form the human face. The classic theory states that facial clefting occurs when the fusion process is disrupted. However, other theories propose that the pathogenesis is related to the infarction of primordial blood vessels, amniotic bands, failure of certain developmental zones of the face to develop completely, or errors in cellular migration, penetration, and differentiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-clefts-and-holoprosencephaly/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Etiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the precise etiology is unknown, multiple genetic and environmental factors may be involved. The environmental risk factors implicated include antenatal exposure to radiation, viral infections, metabolic abnormalities, and teratogenic compounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-clefts-and-holoprosencephaly/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Classification of clefts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Paul Tessier, the father of modern craniofacial surgery, introduced a classification system to describe the anatomic planes along which facial clefts fall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-clefts-and-holoprosencephaly/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The classification system numbers clefts based upon their location surrounding the orbit. Numbers 0 through 7 run inferior to the orbit (facial clefts) from medial to lateral, number 8 runs on the lateral portion of the orbit, and numbers 9 through 14 run superior to the orbit from lateral to medial (cranial clefts) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F69958\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69958 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Clefts commonly have both cranial and facial components. They tend to have greater soft tissue involvement when located medial to the infraorbital foramen and greater bony involvement when located lateral to this landmark [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-clefts-and-holoprosencephaly/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Clinically significant clefts are described below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Number 0 cleft</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This cleft is characterized by a complete absence of the premaxilla and nasal septum with true median cleft lip.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Number 3 cleft (oro-naso-ocular)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This cleft occurs at the site of union of the embryologic maxilla and nasal prominence. Clefting of the lip presents as a defect between canine and lateral incisors. The cleft typically encompasses the alar base and medial canthal region. In severe cases, the cleft may enter the orbit medial to the punctum.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Number 6 to 8 clefts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>These clefts are most commonly present in patients with hemifacial microsomia and Treacher Collins syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syndromes-with-craniofacial-abnormalities\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syndromes with craniofacial abnormalities&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Number 10 cleft</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This cleft extends into the frontal bone near the middle one-third of the orbit and eyelid. Inferolateral displacement of the orbit and globe are frequently present in significant cases. A mass effect associated with potential frontoorbital encephalocele, a defect in which the neural tube bulges into the orbit (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61517\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61517 \">figure 2</a>), may be an underlying cause of orbital disfigurement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Number 14 cleft (frontonasal dysplasia)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In this cleft, the nose is often bifid. Midline encephaloceles may be present, as well as telecanthus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F66342\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66342 \">figure 3</a>). Although excessive distance between orbits may result from abnormal insertion of the canthal tendons, the bony orbits themselves are not excessively separated (hypertelorbitism) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-clefts-and-holoprosencephaly/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment of facial clefts can be complex and requires a multidisciplinary team [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-clefts-and-holoprosencephaly/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The goals of reconstruction are to restore compromised skin, soft tissue, and bone to re-establish functional and aesthetic qualities to the face and cranium. Correction of encephaloceles, deficient corneal protection, or cleft lip deformities are addressed in the neonatal period, whereas other surgical procedures, orthognathic interventions, and revisional surgeries can be performed over the next several years and into adolescence.</p><p>The reconstructive process can be complicated. It often involves multistage procedures that consist of local flaps, tissue resection, fat injections, craniofacial osteotomies, cartilage and bone grafts, free flaps, tissue expansion, and techniques borrowed from other procedures, such as rhinoplasty and cleft <span class=\"nowrap\">lip/palate</span> repair. Surgical plans must be individualized to the specific patient because there is a large degree of variability in presentation; however, methods have been described to treat various Tessier clefts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-clefts-and-holoprosencephaly/abstract/1,7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7-9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">HOLOPROSENCEPHALY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Holoprosencephaly (HPE) is a developmental defect of the embryonic forebrain, or prosencephalon, that is commonly associated with midfacial defects. The defect results from incomplete development of central nervous system (CNS) structures and has a spectrum of presentations; however, there are three classic types: alobar, semilobar, and lobar.</p><p>HPE is relatively rare. The overall prevalence in a multicenter study was 1.31 per 10,000 births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-clefts-and-holoprosencephaly/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Severe cases are not compatible with life. However, milder forms are potentially viable and can require a multidisciplinary approach to ensure both quality of life and survival.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Embryology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HPE results from incomplete development and separation of the midline CNS structures. In normal development, the disk-like neural plate invaginates to form a neural tube during the third embryonic week. Neural crest cells then organize along the neural tube and eventually move toward predetermined destinations. Following neural tube fusion at the midpoint, the process continues both rostrally and caudad to culminate in closure of rostral and caudal neuropores. Concurrently, the primordial brain divides into two hemispheres, and a frontal process takes form. When a disturbance of embryologic growth and development occurs at this stage, HPE may result (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51494\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51494 \">figure 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F73488\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73488 \">figure 5</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Etiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the exact etiology of HPE has yet to be elucidated, the primary cause of the malformation is suspected to be heterogeneous, with both genetic and environmental components [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-clefts-and-holoprosencephaly/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Multiple genes have been linked to HPE, including <em>SHH</em> (sonic hedgehog), <em>ZIC2</em> (zinc finger protein of the cerebellum 2), <em>SIX3</em> (sine oculis homeobox, drosophila, homolog of, 3), <em>TGIF</em> (transforming growth factor-beta-induced factor), and others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-clefts-and-holoprosencephaly/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], while environmental factors, such as maternal diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-clefts-and-holoprosencephaly/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], retinoic acid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-clefts-and-holoprosencephaly/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], and drug and alcohol abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-clefts-and-holoprosencephaly/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>] during early pregnancy, also have been implicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-clefts-and-holoprosencephaly/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. It is believed that the large number of possible combinations of these risk factor &quot;hits&quot; lead to the variable presentation of clinical severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-clefts-and-holoprosencephaly/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Classification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HPE can present within a broad spectrum of clinical severity. A classification system divides HPE into subtypes based upon the degree of cerebral hemisphere separation: lobar, semilobar, and alobar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-clefts-and-holoprosencephaly/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Mild forms of the disease, lobar, present with distinct right and left ventricles, but cerebral continuity is present across the frontal cortex. More severe forms, semilobar, are distinguished by some partial separation of the forebrain, while the most severe form, alobar, results from complete failure of the forebrain to divide into right and left hemispheres.</p><p>A fourth subtype, the middle interhemispheric (MIH) variant, has been described and is an unusual subtype of HPE in which the posterofrontal and parietal areas have midline continuity though the basal forebrain and anterior frontal lobes and occipital regions remain separated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-clefts-and-holoprosencephaly/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The defect in embryogenesis also can lead to a spectrum of deformities involving the median facial structures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F70880\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70880 \">figure 6</a>). Very mild forms of HPE, or microform HPE, may present inconspicuously with a single, central upper incisor. Mild forms of HPE can present with microcephaly, microphthalmia, ocular hypotelorism, midfacial hypoplasia, and cleft lip with or without cleft palate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-clefts-and-holoprosencephaly/abstract/19,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,21</a>]. Severe forms of HPE are associated with more severe facial midline defects, such as a primitive nasal structure (proboscis), cyclopia (a single midline eye), and midfacial clefting.</p><p>In addition, because the malformations involve midline CNS structures, HPE also is associated with some degree of intellectual disability (mental retardation) or developmental delay. Other associated conditions include epilepsy, hydrocephalus, dystonia, movement disorder, autonomic dysfunction, and <span class=\"nowrap\">hypothalamic/pituitary</span> dysfunction. The <span class=\"nowrap\">hypothalamic/pituitary</span> dysfunction can manifest as diabetes insipidus, growth hormone deficiency, adrenal hypoplasia, hypogonadism, or thyroid hypoplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-clefts-and-holoprosencephaly/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Different imaging modalities can be used to diagnose HPE depending on the severity of the condition. Prenatal ultrasound can be used to detect the facial abnormalities that are seen with severe HPE within the first trimester; however, milder forms of the condition may go unnoticed. Fetal magnetic resonance imaging has been used to provide better characterization of the more subtle malformations during the third trimester of pregnancy.</p><p>In infants with suspected HPE, neuroimaging criteria have been established for the assessment of HPE. The imaging modality of choice is high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging scans, which include thin-section image sequences in three orthogonal planes (axial, sagittal, and coronal) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-clefts-and-holoprosencephaly/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. Imaging is important for diagnosis and case management because the severity of the brain malformation generally correlates with the degree of neurologic problems and life expectancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-clefts-and-holoprosencephaly/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Severe HPE is not compatible with life, and children with severe HPE generally do not survive beyond early infancy. In such cases, genetic counseling for the afflicted family is recommended to discuss the nature of the condition and the possibility of recurrence, which is estimated to be 6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-clefts-and-holoprosencephaly/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Milder forms of HPE are more compatible with life, and diagnosis should prompt a medical and genetic workup to rule out syndromic HPE, as well as the other associated conditions (eg, epilepsy, hydrocephalus, dystonia, movement disorder, autonomic dysfunction, and <span class=\"nowrap\">hypothalamic/pituitary</span> dysfunction). The initial medical evaluation for patients with HPE may include serum electrolytes, cortisol, adrenocorticotropin hormone, thyroid-stimulating hormone, free T4, and insulin-like growth factor 1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-clefts-and-holoprosencephaly/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Chromosomal analysis can be important in the management of neonates and infants with HPE. In a population-based case-control study, survival beyond one year of age was decreased in patients with cytogenic abnormalities (2 percent versus 30 to 54 percent among patients without cytogenic abnormalities) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-clefts-and-holoprosencephaly/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Children with milder forms of HPE can have craniofacial defects, hydrocephalus, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> feeding issues that may require surgical intervention in infancy. However, consideration must be given to the risks, benefits, and estimated life expectancy of the child. In a series of 104 children with mild HPE, the mean age was four years; 15 percent of patients were between 10 and 19 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-clefts-and-holoprosencephaly/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>The degree of patient care required generally differs based upon the severity of the condition. In many situations, a multidisciplinary approach is the best. Long-term cognitive and physical treatment is often necessary in these children with HPE. The Carter Neurocognitive Assessment tool is used for the assessment of performance and developmental growth of children with compromised language and motor skills and used specifically with HPE patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/facial-clefts-and-holoprosencephaly/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Physical and occupational therapy also may be helpful in patients with motor dysfunction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Facial clefts and holoprosencephaly (HPE) occur when normal development of the fetal face and cranium is interrupted.
