Microdeletions, or submicroscopic deletions, are chromosomal deletions that are too small to be detected by light microscopy using conventional cytogenetic methods. Specialized testing is needed to identify these deletions. Microdeletions are typically one to three Mb long and involve several contiguous genes. The exact size and location of a microdeletion that causes a syndrome may vary, but a specific &quot;critical region&quot; is consistently involved. Most phenotypic effects of these microdeletions are due to haploinsufficiency of a few critical genes or, in some cases, a single gene.</p><p>This topic reviews microdeletion syndromes involving chromosomes 1 through 11. Microdeletion syndromes involving chromosomes 12 through 22 are discussed separately, as are microduplication syndromes and congenital abnormalities of the sex chromosomes. Other congenital chromosomal abnormalities, such as trisomies, are also reviewed in detail elsewhere.

The most common and better delineated genomic disorders are divided in two main categories: those resulting from copy number losses (deletion syndromes) and copy number gains (duplication syndromes). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genomic-disorders-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genomic disorders: An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Copy number variations (CNVs) are submicroscopic genomic differences in the number of copies of one or more sections of DNA that result in DNA gains or losses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F67644\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67644 \">figure 1</a>). Some CNVs are pathogenic and cause syndromic disorders with consistent phenotypic features, as are discussed here. Other CNVs are associated with disease susceptibility or resistance, and the same CNVs can be associated with several diverse disorders. Still other CNVs are part of normal genetic variation and have no recognized disease association. Contiguous gene syndromes can occur when CNVs affect several adjacent genes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-genetic-variation#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of genetic variation&quot;, section on 'Copy number variations (CNVs)'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-principles-of-genetic-disease#H1031916\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic principles of genetic disease&quot;, section on 'Copy number variation'</a>.)</p><p>The main mechanism leading to disease in genomic disorders is a change in the copy number of a dose-sensitive gene or genes due to a deletion or duplication. This disrupts the gene(s) and alters the amount of protein produced. Other disease mechanisms include uncovering of recessive disorders, disruption of imprinted genes, and regulatory elements outside genes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genomic-disorders-an-overview#H16722227\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genomic disorders: An overview&quot;, section on 'Disease mechanisms'</a>.)</p><p>Genomic disorders are typically detected by array comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F58888\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58888 \">figure 2</a>). Most laboratories confirm gains or losses detected on an array with an independent method, such as fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), multiple ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA), or quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR).

It is characterized by moderate to severe intellectual disabilities and craniofacial dysmorphisms, including microcephaly, brachycephaly, large and persistently open anterior fontanelle, deep-set eyes, straight eyebrows, posteriorly rotated and low-set ears, midface hypoplasia, flat nasal bridge, and pointy chin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microdeletion-syndromes-chromosomes-1-to-11/abstract/1-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-7</a>]. Orofacial clefting can be seen in this deletion. In addition, these patients have hypotonia, congenital heart disease (reported in 43 to 71 percent of individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microdeletion-syndromes-chromosomes-1-to-11/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]; some may develop noncompaction cardiomyopathy), renal anomalies, ophthalmologic abnormalities, skeletal anomalies, hearing loss, feeding difficulties (oropharyngeal dysphagia has been reported in up to 72 percent of affected individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microdeletion-syndromes-chromosomes-1-to-11/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]), and hypothyroidism. Fifty percent develop seizures, and brain abnormalities are prevalent.</p><p>Screening and monitoring studies include electroencephalogram (EEG) to check for seizures if suspected or as a baseline around one year of age, renal ultrasound upon diagnosis to evaluate for structural anomalies, annual thyroid function tests, echocardiogram upon diagnosis and subsequently every two to three years, swallowing evaluations, and auditory brainstem response (ABR) hearing screening. Therapies essential to help with muscle tone and delays include physical, occupational, and speech therapies. Noncompaction cardiomyopathies respond well to conservative treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microdeletion-syndromes-chromosomes-1-to-11/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H86260767\"><span class=\"h1\">DISTAL 1q21.1 DELETION SYNDROME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This 1.35 megabases (Mb) deletion is recurrent in size due to flanking segments that mediate these rearrangements. It is associated with microcephaly, intellectual disabilities (speech delay, learning disabilities), and mild dysmorphic facial features (MIM #612474) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microdeletion-syndromes-chromosomes-1-to-11/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. It is known as Class I 1q21.1 deletion due to its location in the distal area (Class II deletions involve both the distal and proximal areas of the gene region). However, the presentation is variable given incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity, and the microdeletion is seen in unaffected carriers. Other findings can include more severe intellectual disabilities, seizures, cardiac abnormalities, and cataracts. Autism, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), schizophrenia, and other psychiatric abnormalities have been reported. There is no one single gene within this region whose mutation(s) mimics the overall clinical phenotype.</p><p><em>HYDIN2</em> is the putative gene implicated in brain anomalies seen in this disorder since homozygous mutations in the paralog mouse gene cause hydrocephalus. <em>GJA5</em> and <em>GJA8</em> are the hypothesized genes responsible for the heart phenotype and eye abnormalities, respectively.</p><p>Patients may require physical, occupational, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> speech therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H86260827\"><span class=\"h1\">PROXIMAL 1q21.1 DELETION SYNDROME (THROMBOCYTOPENIA ABSENT RADIUS SYNDROME)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thrombocytopenia absent radius syndrome (TAR syndrome, MIM #274000) is characterized by hypomegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia and bilateral absent radii in the presence of thumbs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microdeletion-syndromes-chromosomes-1-to-11/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The thrombocytopenia improves with age and normally disappears by school age. Other skeletal abnormalities, as well as heart and genitourinary anomalies, may occur. Non-immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated cow milk's allergy with gastrointestinal symptoms is observed in some of these children and may exacerbate thrombocytopenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microdeletion-syndromes-chromosomes-1-to-11/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-neonatal-thrombocytopenia#H28\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of neonatal thrombocytopenia&quot;, section on 'Thrombocytopenia-absent radius syndrome'</a>.)</p><p>The etiology and inheritance is complex, although the syndrome is associated with a 1q21.1 deletion in the proximal area of the gene region [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microdeletion-syndromes-chromosomes-1-to-11/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. This deletion extends approximately 200 kilobases (kb), contains 11 genes, and is adjacent but distal (telomeric) to the deletion previously described on 1q21.1. The deleted region contains the gene for RNA-binding motif protein 8A (<em>RBM8A</em>) that encodes the Y14 subunit of exon-junction complex that carries out crucial RNA processing tasks. <em>RBM8A</em> is located on 1q21.1 within the minimal deleted region in 1q21.1. Patients with TAR syndrome have mutations in this gene in addition to the 1q21.1 deletion; therefore, it requires two genetic changes, one each in the chromosome number 1 pair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microdeletion-syndromes-chromosomes-1-to-11/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. This second change consists of a low-frequency single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the 5' untranslated region (5'UTR) of <em>RBM8A</em> or a novel SNP in the first intron of the same gene. These changes were found in 53 of 55 cases of patients with TAR syndrome in one series, with 51 also having the 1q21.1 deletion. This SNP appears to have regulatory properties and ultimately leads to a hypomorphic allele.</p><p>Screening and monitoring studies include an echocardiogram to evaluate for congenital heart disease and close monitoring of platelet counts, particularly in the first weeks to months of life.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6403043\"><span class=\"h1\">2p15-16.1 DELETION SYNDROME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Deletions of this region extend between 4 to 6 megabases (Mb). Clinical features include severe intellectual disability, <span class=\"nowrap\">autism/autistic</span> features, microcephaly, cortical <span class=\"nowrap\">dysplasia/pachygyria</span> on brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), renal abnormalities (multicystic kidneys, hydronephrosis), and camptodactyly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microdeletion-syndromes-chromosomes-1-to-11/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Craniofacial features are characteristic and include progressive microcephaly, flat occiput, small palpebral fissures, telecanthus, broad and high nasal root, long philtrum, rounded upper vermillion border, and everted lower lips. Two genes have been identified in the area as candidates for the autism component: exportin 1 (<em>XPO1</em>) and orthodenticle homolog 1 (<em>OTX1</em>). However, subsequent studies have suggested that <em>OTX1</em> deletions are associated with genitourinary abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microdeletion-syndromes-chromosomes-1-to-11/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

The severity of the seizures and the phenotype often leads to initial diagnoses of Rett, Angelman, or Smith-Magenis syndrome. <em>MBD5</em>, a gene involved in the deleted region, belongs to the methyl CpG-binding protein domain family that also includes the <em>MECP2</em> gene mutated in Rett syndrome. <em>MBD5</em> has also been implicated in autism and neurodevelopmental disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microdeletion-syndromes-chromosomes-1-to-11/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].

This is due to the fact that patients with distal 2q deletions present with mild to moderate intellectual disability, hypotonia, obesity, short stature, and brachydactyly with short phalanges (especially the third to fifth phalanges [brachydactyly type E]), as seen in patients with Albright syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microdeletion-syndromes-chromosomes-1-to-11/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Dysmorphic features include thin, highly arched eyebrows, prominent forehead, depressed nasal bridge, full cheeks, hypoplastic alae nasi, prominent nasal septum, thin upper lip, and ear anomalies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microdeletion-syndromes-chromosomes-1-to-11/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. Autism is commonly reported in this deletion. Less common features include congenital heart disease (septal defects, aortic coarctation), gastrointestinal anomalies (pyloric stenosis, duodenal atresia), and central nervous system (CNS) anomalies.</p><p>The main candidate gene for the brachymetaphalangism seen in this deletion syndrome is histone deacetylase 4 <em>(HDAC4)</em>. Mice with deletions of the homologous gene <span class=\"nowrap\">Hdac4(-/-)</span> have severe bone malformations resulting from premature ossification of developing bones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microdeletion-syndromes-chromosomes-1-to-11/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. The obesity and intellectual disabilities may involve glypican 1 (<em>GPC1</em>), G protein-coupled receptor 35 (<em>GPR35</em>), and <span class=\"nowrap\">serine/threonine</span> protein kinase 25 (<em>STK25</em>). The proposed genes for autism are gamma-2 centaurin (<em>CENTG2</em>) and serotonin receptor 2B (<em>HTR2B</em>). Mutations in the C-natriuretic peptide gene (<em>NPPC</em>) that maps to the region are a possible cause of the skeletal dysplasia seen in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microdeletion-syndromes-chromosomes-1-to-11/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Screening studies include neurodevelopmental and autism evaluations, skeletal survey including hand radiographs, endocrine evaluation, and an echocardiogram.

Congenital heart defects (typically atrioventricular [AV] canal) occur in one-third of patients. Sensorineural hearing loss is frequently reported. The critical region for the deletion is located at 3p25 to 3p26. The deletion develops de novo in almost all cases. Haploinsufficiency of <em>CNTN4</em> (contactin 4), a brain expressed gene, may play a key role in these patients' intellectual disability and autistic characteristics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microdeletion-syndromes-chromosomes-1-to-11/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>], although other data suggest <em>SETD5</em>, a methyltransferase encoding gene located in 3p25, is the critical gene for intellectual disability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microdeletion-syndromes-chromosomes-1-to-11/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].</p><p>Screening of these patients includes echocardiogram at the time of diagnosis; renal ultrasound; and hearing, neurodevelopmental, and autism evaluations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H86260980\"><span class=\"h1\">3q29 DELETION SYNDROME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with this recurrent deletion (MIM #609425) have variable clinical findings despite the fact that the size of the deletion is almost identical (approximately 1.5 to 1.6 megabases [Mb]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microdeletion-syndromes-chromosomes-1-to-11/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. The deletion encompasses 22 genes, although <em>PAK2</em> (p21 protein-activated kinase 2) and <em>DLG1</em> (discs large, drosophila, homolog of, 1) are candidates for the critical genes responsible for the phenotype. These genes are homologs of known X-linked genes associated with intellectual disabilities. The clinical features include mild to moderate intellectual disability, microcephaly (50 percent of cases), and mild dysmorphisms including a narrow face, large ears, short philtrum, and a high nasal bridge. Patients with this deletion may have autism and ataxia. A higher prevalence of psychiatric disorders, such as bipolar disorder, depression, and schizophrenia, are seen in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microdeletion-syndromes-chromosomes-1-to-11/abstract/40-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-45</a>], with a reported prevalence of 28 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microdeletion-syndromes-chromosomes-1-to-11/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

The deletion occurs de novo in approximately 87 percent of cases (approximately 80 percent involve the paternal chromosome) and in the remainder of the cases is due to a balanced translocation in one of the parents (most involve the maternal chromosome) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microdeletion-syndromes-chromosomes-1-to-11/abstract/47-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-49</a>]. The critical region for this syndrome has been narrowed to an approximately 200 kilobase (kb) region that includes the <em>WHSCR1</em> and <em>WHSCR2</em> genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microdeletion-syndromes-chromosomes-1-to-11/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome candidate 1 (<em>WHSC1</em>) gene is deleted in all known cases of Wolf-Hirschhorn syndrome (WHS). This gene encodes an H3K36me3-specific histone methyltransferase (HMTase) that plays a role in transcriptional regulation. One of the factors that WHSC1 modulates is Nkx2-5, a central transcriptional regulator of cardiac development. The interaction of WHSC1 with multiple different transcription factors may account for the variability in clinical phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microdeletion-syndromes-chromosomes-1-to-11/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. In addition, haploinsufficiency of the leucine <span class=\"nowrap\">zipper/EF</span> hand-containing transmembrane protein gene (<em>LETM1</em>), which is also located in the critical region, is implicated in the seizures, motor delay, and growth restriction seen in patients with WHS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microdeletion-syndromes-chromosomes-1-to-11/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>]. This gene encodes a mitochondrial inner membrane protein involved in ion transport. Some patients have larger deletions that can be visually identified in karyotypes, while others have microdeletions. There is some correlation between deletion size and clinical severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microdeletion-syndromes-chromosomes-1-to-11/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p>The common clinical manifestations include pre- and postnatal growth restriction, microcephaly, congenital heart disease (atrial septal defect [ASD], ventricular septal defect [VSD], pulmonic stenosis [PS]), distinctive facial features with a &quot;Greek warrior helmet&quot; appearance of the nose due to high forehead, prominence of the glabella, hypertelorism, high and arched eyebrows, epicanthal folds, and downturned corners of the mouth. All of these patients have significant intellectual disabilities.</p><p>Patients have frequent episodes of respiratory infections due in part to recurrent aspiration. Antibody deficiencies are also common. In one series of 190 patients with WHS, immune defects occurred in approximately 4 percent of patients and included common variable immunodeficiency, immunoglobulin A (IgA) and immunoglobulin G2 (IgG2) subclass deficiency, and impaired polysaccharide responsiveness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microdeletion-syndromes-chromosomes-1-to-11/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].

NSD1 is a histone methyltransferase that is involved in histone modification and chromatin remodeling. Deletions in the chromosomal region containing <em>NSD1</em> are the most common cause of Sotos syndrome in the Japanese population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microdeletion-syndromes-chromosomes-1-to-11/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>], whereas point mutations of the <em>NSD1</em> gene are the most common cause in Caucasian populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microdeletion-syndromes-chromosomes-1-to-11/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. There is some overlap between this condition and Weaver syndrome that is associated with mutations in <em>EZH2</em>, a gene that plays a role in methylation of H3 histones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/microdeletion-syndromes-chromosomes-1-to-11/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].

Hypotonia and delayed gross and fine motor milestones are typical. Oftentimes, these children are considered &quot;clumsy.&quot; They have mild intellectual disabilities. Patients with Sotos syndrome have characteristic facial features, with a bossed forehead, receding hairline, hypertelorism, downslanting palpebral fissures, large ears, high-arched palate, and pointy chin. Premature teeth eruption is commonly seen. Skeletal features include scoliosis and large hands and feet. Advanced bone age is commonly seen. Brain imaging may show dilated ventricles, increased extra-axial cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), cortical atrophy spaces, and abnormalities of the corpus callosum. Cardiac anomalies, including patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and atrial septal defect (ASD), are frequent in patients with 5q35 deletion.
