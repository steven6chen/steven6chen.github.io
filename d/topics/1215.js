Out-toeing is a rotational variation of the lower extremity where the feet or toes point away from the midline during gait (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75796\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75796 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>In-toeing and out-toeing are among the most common anatomic musculoskeletal variations encountered by pediatric primary care providers and a frequent reason for referral to a pediatric orthopedic surgeon. However, most children with in-toeing or out-toeing have variations of normal lower-extremity development that will improve spontaneously and can be monitored by the primary care provider.</p><p>An understanding of the normal growth and development of the lower extremity is essential in evaluating a child's rotational alignment and helps to elucidate the mechanism of out-toeing. The most common causes of out-toeing in children are external rotation contracture of the hip, external tibial torsion, and femoral retroversion. These rotational variations are seen in normal, healthy children and rarely persist into adolescence. Although out-toeing rarely causes dysfunction, out-toeing due to persistent external tibial torsion may be associated with patellofemoral pain. History and examination generally are sufficient to distinguish common rotational variations from less common pathologic causes of in-toeing and out-toeing (eg, hemiplegic cerebral palsy). (See <a href=\"#H141830452\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p>This topic will provide an overview of lower-extremity rotational development, common causes of out-toeing, pathologic causes of out-toeing that must be excluded, and an approach to the evaluation and management of the child with out-toeing. In-toeing is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-child-with-in-toeing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the child with in-toeing&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H141828373\"><span class=\"h1\">NORMAL PHYSIOLOGIC ALIGNMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rotational alignment of the lower extremity is determined by the alignment of the foot, the rotation of the tibia in relation to the transcondylar axis of the femur (tibial torsion), and the rotation of the neck of the femur in relation to the transcondylar axis of the femur (femoral anteversion) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F56825\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56825 \">figure 2</a>). In-toeing and out-toeing may be accentuated between six months and five years, when children are developing their walking and coordination skills [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-out-toeing/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Normal growth and improved coordination typically lead to spontaneous resolution of rotational variations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64901\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64901 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Intrauterine positioning has an important influence on the rotational alignment of the legs. At the seventh week of gestation, the lower limb rotates medially (internally), followed by external (lateral) rotation of the upper leg. For the remainder of gestation, the tibiae and feet are medially (internally) rotated, and the hips and femora are laterally (externally) rotated, resulting in an external rotation contracture at the hip joint (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F79381\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79381 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-out-toeing/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Normal newborn posture reflects intrauterine positioning. The hips are flexed and externally rotated, with the patellae pointing outward. The tibiae and feet remain relatively internally rotated, but this is overshadowed by the external rotation contracture at the hip [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-out-toeing/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Out-toeing due to external rotation contracture of the hip usually resolves by the time the child begins walking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-out-toeing/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H141829701\"><span class=\"h1\">COMMON CAUSES OF OUT-TOEING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common causes of out-toeing are external rotation contracture of the hip, external tibial torsion, and femoral retroversion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F80335\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80335 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H141829708\"><span class=\"h2\">External rotation contracture of the hip</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The normal intrauterine position of flexed and externally rotated hips results in an external rotation contracture of the hips. This causes out-toeing when the young child is lying down as well as when he or she begins to stand and walk. When combined with physiologic tibia vara, hip external rotation contracture may accentuate the appearance of bowed legs. External rotation contracture of the hip is typically bilateral and symmetrical.</p><p>Characteristic examination features include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bilateral and symmetrical out-toeing</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When standing and walking, both the patella and feet point away from the midline (external foot progression angle and external patella progression angle) (see <a href=\"#H141830473\" class=\"local\">'Observation of gait'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased hip external rotation compared with internal rotation (see <a href=\"#H141830480\" class=\"local\">'Focused examination of the lower extremities'</a> below)</p><p/><p>Out-toeing due to external hip rotation contracture usually resolves around 12 months of age when the child begins to walk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-out-toeing/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

They can generally be excluded through history, physical examination, and radiographs.</p><p>Developmental hip disorders may present with out-toeing gait. SCFE and LCP may result in proximal femoral deformity causing a derangement in hip rotation. Children with SCFE or LCP most commonly have limited hip internal rotation. They may present with pain in the hip, thigh, or knee with a limp and unilateral out-toeing. Examination may demonstrate painful range of motion of the hip with decreased internal rotation and increased external rotation. Anteroposterior and frog leg (lateral) pelvis radiographs should be obtained in children with suspected SCFE or LCP. Referral to an orthopedic surgeon is also warranted in such children.

The presence or absence of a limp should be noted. Additionally, the foot progression and patellar progression angles should be noted.

Running may accentuate neurologic dysfunction and rotational variations. Unilateral limp while walking or running should raise suspicion of pathologic causes of out-toeing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H141830480\"><span class=\"h3\">Focused examination of the lower extremities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Examination of the rotational alignment of the lower extremities is best done with the patient lying prone on the examination table [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-out-toeing/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The parents should be encouraged to stand with the examiner next to the patient so that they can appreciate the findings as the examination is performed. The examination should progress through the three main sites for rotational variations: foot, tibia, and <span class=\"nowrap\">femur/hip</span>. This can be accomplished by making the following measurements:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thigh-foot angle &ndash; The thigh-foot angle is measured with the knee flexed and the ankle dorsiflexed so that the plantar surface of the foot is parallel to the ceiling. Allow the foot to fall into a neutral position. A visual line is approximated along the long axis of the thigh and a second line along the long axis of the heel. The angle between these two lines is the thigh-foot angle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F68556\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68556 \">figure 4</a>). If the line of the heel points toward the midline relative to the thigh, it suggests internal torsion of the tibia. If the line of the heel points away from the midline relative to the thigh, it suggests external torsion of the tibia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Normal values for the thigh-foot angle were determined in a study of 1000 limbs of 500 subjects (all white) ranging in age from &lt;1 to 70 years (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F67096\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67096 \">figure 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-out-toeing/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The average thigh-foot angle at birth is 5 degrees (external) and increases to 15 degrees (external) at maturity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hip rotation &ndash; Hip rotation is measured with the knees flexed. Internal rotation is measured by rotating the leg away from the axis of the body (rotating the hip internally). External rotation is measured by rotating the leg towards the axis of the body (rotating the hip externally).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Normal values for hip rotation were determined in a study of 1000 limbs of 500 subjects (all white) ranging in age from &lt;1 to 70 years (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71765\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71765 \">figure 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-out-toeing/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The average amount of internal hip rotation during childhood is between 40 and 50 degrees. The average amount of external hip rotation during childhood is between 40 and 70 degrees.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients with femoral retroversion will have increased external rotation (to almost 90 degrees) and very little internal rotation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-out-toeing/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Conversely, patients with increased femoral anteversion may have as much as 90 degrees of internal rotation, allowing the legs to rotate flat against the exam table.

The most common causes of out-toeing in children are external rotation contracture of the hip, external tibial torsion, and femoral retroversion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F80335\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80335 \">table 2</a>). These rotational variations are related to intrauterine molding and often resolve spontaneously through normal growth and development. (See <a href=\"#H141828373\" class=\"local\">'Normal physiologic alignment'</a> above and <a href=\"#H141829701\" class=\"local\">'Common causes of out-toeing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physiologic external rotation contracture of the hip is caused by intrauterine positioning and present in children from birth until they begin to walk. External rotation contracture of the hip is characterized by external foot and patella progression angles, increased external rotation, and decreased internal rotation. It usually resolves when children begin to walk. (See <a href=\"#H141829708\" class=\"local\">'External rotation contracture of the hip'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>External tibial torsion is external (lateral) rotation of the tibia in relation to the transcondylar axis of the femur. It may be associated with prematurity and prone positioning. It is characterized by an external foot progression angle and neutral or internal patella progression angle, and medial malleolus even with or anterior to the lateral malleolus. External tibial torsion usually does not correct spontaneously and may increase with growth. Although most patients with external tibial torsion remain asymptomatic, there may be an increased risk of patellofemoral pain or instability and knee arthritis. Symptomatic patients may require derotational osteotomy. (See <a href=\"#H141829715\" class=\"local\">'External tibial torsion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Femoral retroversion is a rare cause of out-toeing. It is characterized by a decreased angle of rotation of the femoral neck in relation to the transcondylar axis of the femur; gait with outward facing feet and knees; and increased hip external rotation and decreased internal rotation. Femoral retroversion does not improve spontaneously and may be associated with hip or knee arthritis, stress fracture, and slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE). (See <a href=\"#H141829722\" class=\"local\">'Femoral retroversion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pathologic conditions that must be considered in the evaluation of a child with out-toeing include SCFE, Legg-Calv&eacute;-Perthes disease (idiopathic osteonecrosis of the hip), and neuromuscular disorders. Among these, SCFE is the most important to exclude. Anteroposterior and frog leg (lateral) radiographs of the pelvis should be obtained in children with unilateral out-toeing associated with hip, thigh, or knee pain and decreased internal rotation of the hip. Children with radiographs suggestive of SCFE should be urgently referred to an orthopedic surgeon. (See <a href=\"#H141829729\" class=\"local\">'Uncommon pathologic causes of out-toeing'</a> above and <a href=\"#H141830452\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-slipped-capital-femoral-epiphysis-scfe\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of slipped capital femoral epiphysis (SCFE)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most children with rotational variations of the lower extremity can be followed in the primary care office. The most important aspect of management of rotational causes of out-toeing is parental reassurance that most &quot;deformities&quot; correct spontaneously and that, even in persistent cases, adverse long-term sequelae are rare. Nonoperative interventions (eg, shoe inserts, braces, twister cables, casting) are ineffective in the treatment of internal and external tibial torsion, increased femoral anteversion, and femoral retroversion. These interventions should be avoided. (See <a href=\"#H141831169\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indications for referral for out-toeing include external tibial torsion and femoral retroversion associated with severe cosmetic or functional problems, hip pain, or knee pain; unilateral out-toeing associated with limp, hip pain, or knee pain; and out-toeing with concern for SCFE.
