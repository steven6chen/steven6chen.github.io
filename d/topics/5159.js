Plasma cell neoplasms can present as a single lesion (solitary plasmacytoma) or as multiple lesions (multiple myeloma [MM]). Solitary plasmacytomas most frequently occur in bone (plasmacytoma of bone), but can also be found outside bone in soft tissues (extramedullary plasmacytoma) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-solitary-plasmacytoma-of-bone/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. Why some patients develop MM and others plasmacytoma is not understood, but might be related to differences in cellular adhesion molecules or chemokine receptor expression profiles of the malignant plasma cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-solitary-plasmacytoma-of-bone/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Solitary plasmacytoma of bone (SPB, also called osseous plasmacytoma) is a localized tumor in the bone comprised of a single clone of plasma cells in the absence of other features of MM (ie, anemia, hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, or multiple lytic bone lesions) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-solitary-plasmacytoma-of-bone/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>The diagnosis and management of SPB will be reviewed here.

In the United States, the incidence is approximately 0.15 <span class=\"nowrap\">cases/100,000</span> person-years accounting for approximately 450 new cases per year. The incidence is highest in Blacks and lowest in Asians and Pacific Islanders. Men are diagnosed twice as frequently as women. The median age at diagnosis is 55 to 65 years, which compares with a median age at diagnosis of 71 years for patients with multiple myeloma (MM) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-solitary-plasmacytoma-of-bone/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>].

These patients may be treated in a similar fashion to SPB if the bone marrow plasmacytosis is modest and there are no other myeloma defining events. Most of these patients will be staged as Durie-Salmon stage I myeloma. If patients have more extensive plasmacytosis, systemic therapy can be considered in addition, although there are limited data available to guide therapy.

A distinction between these two conditions is made based upon the exclusion of additional lesions in patients with SPB. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-laboratory-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-multiple-myeloma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, laboratory manifestations, and diagnosis of multiple myeloma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>As mentioned above, the diagnosis of SPB requires the exclusion of many features of MM as evidenced by the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Normal bone marrow with no evidence of clonal plasma cells.

(See <a href=\"#H1965425\" class=\"local\">'SPB meeting criteria for multiple myeloma'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">POEMS syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>POEMS syndrome (osteosclerotic myeloma: <strong>P</strong>olyneuropathy, <strong>O</strong>rganomegaly, <strong>E</strong>ndocrinopathy, <strong>M</strong>onoclonal protein, <strong>S</strong>kin changes) is a monoclonal plasma cell disorder accompanied by symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> signs of peripheral neuropathy, osteosclerotic lesions, Castleman's disease, organomegaly, endocrinopathy (excluding diabetes mellitus or hypothyroidism), edema, typical skin changes, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> papilledema. These patients typically have elevated serum vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=poems-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;POEMS syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with either SPB or POEMS syndrome may present with a single osteolytic bone lesion with a sclerotic rim, or a single osteosclerotic bone lesion and a small amount of a monoclonal protein in the serum or urine. Although not always straightforward, the presence of an osteosclerotic component to the bone lesion <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> other minor criteria for POEMS should distinguish patients with POEMS from those with SPB (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F64782\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64782 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Metastatic carcinoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of a lytic bone lesion in a patient with a monoclonal gammopathy suggests the possibility of SPB or MM. However, metastatic carcinoma (eg, kidney, breast, non-small cell lung cancer) can produce lytic lesions, and a subset of patients presenting in this way will have metastatic cancer with an associated, unrelated monoclonal gammopathy (eg, MGUS). Typically, however, patients with metastatic carcinoma have multiple lytic bone lesions rather than a single lesion such as that seen with SPB. Persons presenting with lytic bone lesions, constitutional symptoms, a small M component, and fewer than 10 percent clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow, are more likely to have metastatic carcinoma with an unrelated MGUS rather than SPB. This can be confirmed with a biopsy of the bone lesion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary treatment for patients with SPB is localized radiation therapy. Surgery may be required for patients with structural instability of the bone, retropulsed bone, or rapidly progressive symptoms from cord compression. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-the-complications-of-multiple-myeloma#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of the complications of multiple myeloma&quot;, section on 'Skeletal lesions'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of neoplastic epidural spinal cord compression, including cauda equina syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The use of adjuvant or prophylactic chemotherapy in this population is controversial. Bisphosphonates are not recommended for patients with SPB, except in the setting of underlying osteopenia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-use-of-osteoclast-inhibitors-in-patients-with-multiple-myeloma#H488867\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The use of osteoclast inhibitors in patients with multiple myeloma&quot;, section on 'Benefits of bisphosphonates in myeloma'</a>.)</p><p>The median overall survival of patients with SPB is approximately 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-solitary-plasmacytoma-of-bone/abstract/10,14,25-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,14,25-29</a>]. Overall survival rates at 5 and 10 years are approximately 75 and 45 percent, respectively, with corresponding disease-free survival rates of 45 and 25 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-solitary-plasmacytoma-of-bone/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. A little more than half of patients with SPB will eventually develop overt MM.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Localized radiation therapy (RT), given at a dose of 40 to 50 Gy over approximately four weeks, is the treatment of choice for SPB. Localized RT directed at the tumor site should be given even if the plasmacytoma appears to have been completely excised for diagnostic purposes. The local response rate to RT exceeds 80 to 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-solitary-plasmacytoma-of-bone/abstract/25,30-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,30-33</a>] and appears to be highest in tumors &lt;5 cm in maximum diameter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-solitary-plasmacytoma-of-bone/abstract/15,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,31</a>].</p><p>The use of RT for the treatment of SPB is largely based upon data from retrospective studies. There have been no randomized trials of RT for patients with SPB. The largest retrospective study included 258 patients with SPB (206 patients) or extramedullary plasmacytoma (52 patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-solitary-plasmacytoma-of-bone/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Treatments included RT alone (214 patients), RT plus chemotherapy (34 patients), and surgery alone (8 patients). Five-year rates of overall survival, disease-free survival, and local control were 74, 50, and 86 percent, respectively. Patients who received localized RT had a lower rate of local relapse than those who did not receive radiation (12 versus 60 percent).</p><p>The ideal radiation dose for SPB is unknown. Published papers have reported doses ranging from 30 to 60 Gy, with most radiation oncologists advocating the use 40 to 50 Gy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-solitary-plasmacytoma-of-bone/abstract/10,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,15</a>].</p><p>For patients with SPB, we recommend initial localized RT rather than chemotherapy or observation. RT should be delivered at a dose of 40 to 50 Gy over four weeks directed at the tumor or site of tumor resection (in the case of complete diagnostic excision).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Chemotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of adjuvant or prophylactic chemotherapy for SPB is controversial. Some studies have suggested no benefit with adjuvant therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-solitary-plasmacytoma-of-bone/abstract/9,26,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,26,34</a>], while others have concluded that adjuvant chemotherapy prevents or delays the median time to progression to MM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-solitary-plasmacytoma-of-bone/abstract/25,30,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,30,35</a>].</p><p>The following are examples of studies demonstrating a benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective study of 46 patients with SPB (32 patients) or extramedullary plasmacytoma, adjuvant chemotherapy did not affect the incidence of conversion to MM, but did appear to delay the median time to progression from 29 to 59 months thereby postponing further treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-solitary-plasmacytoma-of-bone/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A trial in 53 patients with SPB randomly assigned treatment with either local radiotherapy (RT) plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=melphalan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">melphalan</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> for three years or RT alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-solitary-plasmacytoma-of-bone/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. After a median follow-up of 8.9 years, disease-free survival was significantly higher in the patients who received RT plus chemotherapy (22 of 25 patients) than in those treated with RT alone (13 of 28).</p><p/><p>However, the above studies are small, and overall we believe that the available literature does not support the use of adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with SPB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-solitary-plasmacytoma-of-bone/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This approach treats patients with locally treated SPB in a similar fashion to those with asymptomatic MM. For this group of patients there is an absence of clear benefit from chemotherapy with currently available therapies and reports that some patients remain stable without treatment over extended periods of time. For patients with SPB, we suggest observation after initial radiation therapy rather than the use of adjuvant chemotherapy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients with multiple plasmacytomas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 30 to 50 percent of patients with suspected SPB will have multiple asymptomatic lesions detected by <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> or MRI of the spine. The management of patients with &quot;multiple solitary plasmacytomas,&quot; defined as the presence of more than one plasmacytoma (occurring concurrently or sequentially) in the absence of bone marrow evidence of MM, is challenging. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Many clinicians advocate the use of local radiation directed at the symptomatic site with further treatment postponed until the development of symptoms. In contrast, our approach depends upon the number and location of involved sites: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If a patient has two concurrent distinct plasmacytomas with no bone marrow involvement, we would proceed with radiation to both sites followed by observation provided the radiation fields are limited. If the radiation fields will be large and may interfere with stem cell collection or bone marrow reserve, we administer systemic therapy identical to that used for MM instead of radiation.

Overt multiple myeloma (MM) ultimately develops in 50 to 60 percent of patients with SPB after initial radiation therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-solitary-plasmacytoma-of-bone/abstract/2,25,27,31,32,36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,25,27,31,32,36,37</a>]. This disease progression is thought to arise from previously undetectable myeloma cells in areas outside the radiation field or from myeloma within the radiation field in the setting of sublethal radiation doses. </p><p>The prognosis of SPB varies depending on the adequacy of initial staging. In one study, among 91 patients seen at the Mayo Clinic with newly diagnosed SPB and no clonal bone marrow plasma cells by immunofluorescence, approximately 40 percent were free of recurrence at eight years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-solitary-plasmacytoma-of-bone/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The risk of recurrence decreases further among patients with no evidence of disease elsewhere on <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span>. In contrast, there is almost always recurrence if there are detectable clonal bone marrow plasma cells at the time of initial diagnosis. In two retrospective studies, detection of phenotypically aberrant clonal plasma cells by flow cytometry of the bone marrow was associated with a higher likelihood of progression to MM at 26 months (approximately 70 versus 6 to 12 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-solitary-plasmacytoma-of-bone/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].</p><p>While most patients will progress to MM within the first four years, others may demonstrate progression more than a decade after completion of therapy. As an example, two retrospective analyses found that approximately two-thirds of the patients who progress do so within four years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-solitary-plasmacytoma-of-bone/abstract/10,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,27</a>], although progression can occur as late as 13 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-solitary-plasmacytoma-of-bone/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Three patterns of failure were seen:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Development of MM &ndash; 54 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Local recurrence &ndash; 11 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Development of new lesions (multiple plasmacytomas) in the absence of MM &ndash; 2 percent</p><p/><p>Relapse rates are higher in older patients and in those with axial skeletal lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-solitary-plasmacytoma-of-bone/abstract/14,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,31,32</a>], while patients younger than 60 years and with tumors &lt;5 cm have a better overall survival rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-solitary-plasmacytoma-of-bone/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Other reported predictors for conversion to MM include a large solitary lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-solitary-plasmacytoma-of-bone/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], the presence of osteopenia, reduction in uninvolved immunoglobulin levels (eg, low levels of IgA <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> IgM in a patient with an IgG plasmacytoma) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-solitary-plasmacytoma-of-bone/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>], and the presence of high-grade angiogenesis in the tumor sample [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-solitary-plasmacytoma-of-bone/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Monoclonal protein and abnormal free light chain ratio</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence or absence of a monoclonal (M) protein at the time of diagnosis of SPB does not appear to have a major effect on long-term outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-solitary-plasmacytoma-of-bone/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], although persistence of a serum M-protein after radiation therapy appears to be a significant predictor of subsequent progression to MM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-solitary-plasmacytoma-of-bone/abstract/14,18,25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,18,25-27</a>].

Most patients present with skeletal pain or a pathologic fracture of the affected bone. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p>The evaluation of a patient with a suspected SPB should include a biopsy of the suspected lesion, a unilateral bone marrow aspirate and biopsy, and laboratory studies. Imaging should include a metastatic bone survey and either a positron emission <span class=\"nowrap\">tomography/computed</span> tomography <span class=\"nowrap\">(PET/CT)</span> scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the entire spine and pelvis. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with SPB, we recommend initial therapy with localized radiation rather than chemotherapy or observation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). Radiation should be delivered at a dose of 40 to 50 Gy over four weeks directed at the tumor or site of tumor resection (in the case of complete diagnostic excision). (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Radiation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After initial radiation therapy for patients with SPB, we suggest observation rather than the use of adjuvant chemotherapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Chemotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p>Bisphosphonates are not recommended for patients with SPB, except in the setting of underlying osteopenia.
