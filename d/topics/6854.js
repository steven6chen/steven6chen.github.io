Thus, the differential diagnosis for upper or lower back pain in these patients is broad. In addition to severe intrathoracic (eg, aortic injury), intraabdominal, and pelvic injuries, clinicians should consider spinal cord injury, spinal epidural hematoma, paraspinal hematoma, retroperitoneal hematoma and kidney injury, and soft tissue injuries. Diagnostic imaging must be obtained to differentiate among these entities.

In all cases of possible spinal injury, spinal immobilization must be maintained until the possibility of injury is excluded by clinical or radiographic means. General performance of the secondary survey is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults#H1929825\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of trauma in adults&quot;, section on 'Secondary evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>Thoracolumbar (TL) fractures most commonly occur after motor vehicle collisions, a fall from a height, or penetrating trauma, including gunshot wounds. Many forces may be involved in TL fractures, including compression, flexion, extension, rotation, shear, and distraction. However, the most common fracture mechanism is that of a compression fracture from an axial load. Age, female gender, and osteoporosis are considered major risk factors, as vertebral body compression fractures are more common in those with decreased bone density. Some malignancies have a propensity to metastasize to the spinal column (eg, lung, breast, prostate) and may lead to pathological fractures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spinal-column-injuries-in-adults-definitions-mechanisms-and-radiographs#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spinal column injuries in adults: Definitions, mechanisms, and radiographs&quot;, section on 'Mechanisms of injury'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13321950\"><span class=\"h2\">Spine immobilization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although some authorities advocate using a long board for performing spinal immobilization on trauma patients in the prehospital setting, there is considerable variation in technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-thoracic-and-lumbar-spinal-column-injury/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] and the length of time a patient remains on the board after arriving at the emergency department (ED) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-thoracic-and-lumbar-spinal-column-injury/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Many advocate that the long board only be used for extrication and transport to the hospital, and that it be removed promptly after the primary survey [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-thoracic-and-lumbar-spinal-column-injury/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. We concur with this viewpoint.</p><p>Prolonged immobilization on a spine board can lead to decubitus ulcers and contribute to respiratory compromise, and may not adequately immobilize the spine (eg, the gap often visible between the patient&rsquo;s back and the board clearly demonstrates the lack of lumbar support) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-thoracic-and-lumbar-spinal-column-injury/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, rigorous outcome studies to determine the effect of spinal immobilization upon the mortality, neurological morbidity, and overall outcomes of trauma patients are lacking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-thoracic-and-lumbar-spinal-column-injury/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The optimal technique for immobilizing the spine remains uncertain. Several techniques and a range of immobilization devices are used, including standard backboards, vacuum splints, and scoop stretchers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-thoracic-and-lumbar-spinal-column-injury/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In most instances, we use the following approach. Once the primary survey is completed, a patient being managed with spine immobilization is log-rolled onto their side while axial alignment is maintained. At least three people are needed to perform the log-roll properly. Next, a clinician inspects and palpates the entire length of the spine. If there is no sign of injury and no spinal tenderness, the backboard is removed. However, some clinicians prefer to continue immobilization with a long board until initial radiographs are obtained, provided these studies are not delayed. Note that some spine boards contain metal rods which may interfere with radiographs and should be removed prior to imaging.</p><p>If continued immobilization is deemed necessary (eg, due to radiographic abnormality, neurologic deficit, or high suspicion for spinal injury in an obtunded patient), the patient is carefully log-rolled while maintaining axial alignment, the spine board is removed, and the patient is moved onto a firm mattress, generally using a sliding board [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-thoracic-and-lumbar-spinal-column-injury/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Often a slider board can be introduced at the same time the long board is removed, thereby minimizing patient motion. Nevertheless, the key, concept is that even the patient who warrants continued immobilization should be removed from the hard spine board before complications, such as pressure sores or aspiration, occur. When there is no concomitant vertebral fracture, the incidence of isolated ligamentous injury of the thoracolumbar spine is low. If an injury of the cervical spine is known or suspected, a cervical collar should be kept in place.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1101568\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical findings of TL spine injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As part of the secondary survey, the entire back, chest, and abdomen should be inspected and palpated. Patients with major injuries to the chest, abdomen, or pelvis often sustain injuries to the thoracolumbar (TL) spine as well. Back pain and neurologic dysfunction are clinical findings associated with TL spinal column injuries.</p><p>Depending upon the body habitus of the injured patient, the ability to palpate any deformity or step-off of the spine may be difficult, particularly in an uncooperative patient. A prospective observational study reported that clinical examination detected only 27 of 56 TL spine fractures among blunt trauma patients capable of being evaluated (sensitivity 48.2 percent, specificity 84.9 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-thoracic-and-lumbar-spinal-column-injury/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In this study, approximately two-thirds of the TL fractures sustained were of the transverse process. Advanced imaging of the involved region is warranted if the clinician detects focal tenderness, a neurologic deficit, or spinal deformity. (See <a href=\"#H7762775\" class=\"local\">'CT for thoracic and lumbar spinal column injury'</a> below.)</p><p>Other signs suggestive of spinal column injury include contusions, abrasions, lacerations, open wounds, or muscle spasm in the general area of the spine. Any deviations from normal spinal curvature should be noted. Fractures can cause a kyphotic or scoliotic deformity; muscle spasms can cause a straightening of the spine and loss of lordosis. Note that the region of the spine between the T11 and L4 vertebrae is most susceptible to injury. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spinal-column-injuries-in-adults-definitions-mechanisms-and-radiographs#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spinal column injuries in adults: Definitions, mechanisms, and radiographs&quot;, section on 'Anatomy'</a>.)</p><p>Whenever feasible, a focused, but systematic neurologic evaluation should be performed in all patients with a possible TL spinal column injury. Ideally, this examination includes assessment of motor function, sensation, reflexes, and position sense. A significant portion of TL fractures damage the distal spinal cord or cauda equina to some degree [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-thoracic-and-lumbar-spinal-column-injury/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>], and such injuries can present with lower extremity paresis, lower extremity or saddle anesthesia, or loss of bladder or anal sphincter function.</p><p>Decreased rectal tone is thought to be a late finding of the cauda equina syndrome and is often absent immediately following an acute injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-thoracic-and-lumbar-spinal-column-injury/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Although previous iterations of Advanced Trauma Life Support advocated performing a digital rectal examination on all trauma patients during the secondary survey, there is no clear evidence that the examination is an accurate means for detecting spinal cord injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-thoracic-and-lumbar-spinal-column-injury/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>]. The most recent edition of Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) does not mandate a rectal examination during the secondary survey [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-thoracic-and-lumbar-spinal-column-injury/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].The neurologic examination and localization of spinal cord lesions are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-detailed-neurologic-examination-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The detailed neurologic examination in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anatomy-and-localization-of-spinal-cord-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anatomy and localization of spinal cord disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Among patients who sustain high-energy trauma, scapular contusions suggest a rotation or flexion-rotation injury of the thoracic spine. Close evaluation of the thoracic spine, generally including spinal reconstructions from a CT of the chest, is prudent in such cases. Large contusions in the lumbosacral area following trauma are associated with shear fractures in this region. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spinal-column-injuries-in-adults-definitions-mechanisms-and-radiographs#H28\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spinal column injuries in adults: Definitions, mechanisms, and radiographs&quot;, section on 'Translational spinal column injury'</a>.)</p><p>The classic presentation for a flexion-distraction injury (eg, Chance fracture) of the TL spine is that of a backseat passenger restrained by a lap belt only, without a shoulder strap [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-thoracic-and-lumbar-spinal-column-injury/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Such a patient may manifest ecchymosis on the lower abdomen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F95085\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef95085 \">picture 1</a>) and tenderness at the lumbar fracture site, but the absence of these signs does not preclude the diagnosis. Although neurologic deficits occur in fewer than 5 percent, patients with Chance fractures often sustain intraabdominal injury, such as intestinal perforation, hematoma, or contusion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spinal-column-injuries-in-adults-definitions-mechanisms-and-radiographs#H27\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spinal column injuries in adults: Definitions, mechanisms, and radiographs&quot;, section on 'Flexion-distraction (lap belt) injuries'</a>.)</p><p>The pelvis and lower extremities should be examined, paying particular attention to pelvic stability, signs of injury, and neurologic function. Approximately 10 percent of calcaneal fractures are associated with lumbar fractures when the mechanism of injury involves axial compression, such as a fall from a significant height [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-thoracic-and-lumbar-spinal-column-injury/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spinal-column-injuries-in-adults-definitions-mechanisms-and-radiographs#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spinal column injuries in adults: Definitions, mechanisms, and radiographs&quot;, section on 'Burst fractures'</a>.)</p><p>Although performance of a careful physical examination remains important, the findings of several observational studies suggest that clinical examination alone is <strong>not</strong> sufficiently sensitive or specific to rule out or identify significant TL spine injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-thoracic-and-lumbar-spinal-column-injury/abstract/7,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,19,20</a>]. According to a retrospective observational study of 536 blunt trauma patients with TL spine fractures, the absence of back pain or tenderness during a log-roll examination did not exclude a clinically significant thoracic fracture even among patients with a GCS of 15 who were not under the influence of alcohol and had not yet been treated with opioids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-thoracic-and-lumbar-spinal-column-injury/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In a large prospective study, over 20 percent of patients with a TL spine injury requiring surgical management or fixed immobilization had no significant findings on physical examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-thoracic-and-lumbar-spinal-column-injury/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Therefore, preliminary rules for determining the need for imaging in patients with possible TL spine trauma include the mechanism of injury and other factors, in addition to examination findings. (See <a href=\"#H7762768\" class=\"local\">'Decision rules for imaging thoracic or lumbar spine injury'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7762768\"><span class=\"h1\">DECISION RULES FOR IMAGING THORACIC OR LUMBAR SPINE INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In contrast to cervical spine trauma, few studies have been performed to develop decision rules for imaging potential thoracic and lumbar spine injuries. Based on the available evidence, we suggest that imaging studies of the thoracolumbar (TL) spine be obtained for trauma patients who meet any of the following criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-thoracic-and-lumbar-spinal-column-injury/abstract/21-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-28</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Signs of TL spine injury, including:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Focal pain or tenderness over the TL spine</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Signs of injury (eg, bruising, hematoma, palpable step-off) along the TL spine</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Neurologic deficit consistent with TL injury</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High-force mechanism, including:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Fall greater than 3 m (10 feet)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Ejection from a vehicle</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Moderate or high-velocity motor vehicle crash</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Unenclosed motor vehicle crash (eg, motorcycle crash)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Automobile versus pedestrian</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Forceful direct blow (eg, struck with bat in area of TL spine)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence of another spine injury, particularly a known cervical fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-thoracic-and-lumbar-spinal-column-injury/abstract/26,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,29</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Painful distracting injury in patients with complaints or a mechanism consistent with TL spine injury</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age over 60 years in patients with complaints or a mechanism consistent with TL spine injury (mechanism may include fall from standing in frail older adults) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-thoracic-and-lumbar-spinal-column-injury/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depressed mental status, including clinical signs of intoxication or GCS below 15, in patients with complaints or a mechanism consistent with TL spine injury</p><p/><p>We concur with the general approach described in the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma practice guidelines and believe that diagnostic imaging of the TL spine is generally not necessary in blunt trauma patients with a normal mental status and none of the risk factors described above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-thoracic-and-lumbar-spinal-column-injury/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>The presence of one vertebral fracture in a blunt trauma patient mandates radiographic evaluation of the entire spine, as the risk of a second, noncontiguous fracture may be as high as 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-thoracic-and-lumbar-spinal-column-injury/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. The association with a second fracture appears to be higher in patients who sustain high energy blunt trauma and those with cervical fractures. Using data from the National Trauma Database of the United States, a retrospective analysis that included over 80,000 patients with spine fractures following blunt trauma reported that 13 percent of patients with a cervical spine fracture also had either a thoracic or a lumbar fracture, while 10 percent of patients had concomitant thoracic and lumbar fractures.</p><p>It is important to note the limitations of the physical examination in the setting of TL spine injury. In one large prospective study, over 20 percent of patients with a TL spine injury requiring surgical management or fixed immobilization had no significant findings on physical examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-thoracic-and-lumbar-spinal-column-injury/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Diagnostic imaging may still be required despite an unremarkable physical examination. (See <a href=\"#H1101568\" class=\"local\">'Clinical findings of TL spine injury'</a> above.)</p><p>Trauma patients with altered mental status may need imaging depending upon their level of alertness, examination findings, and clinical suspicion. Such patients are at higher risk of injury. Spinal immobilization is maintained until unstable injury is ruled out by clinical or radiographic evaluation. The manual for Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) describes a similar approach, recommending imaging for &quot;&hellip;any patient with an altered level of consciousness or cognitive dysfunction, GCS &lt;15, multi-system injuries, or a palpable gap or tenderness in the thoracolumbar area&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-thoracic-and-lumbar-spinal-column-injury/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>For patients with major trauma, high-risk features, or depressed mental status, multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) is the imaging modality of choice, used to assess the TL spine. In most instances, reconstructed images obtained from MDCT scans of the chest and abdomen performed as part of the patient's trauma evaluation can be used to assess the thoracic and lumbar (TL) spine. The use of reconstructed images reduces time, cost, and radiation exposure. A retrospective comparison of 72 patients who underwent both abdomino-pelvic MDCT and an additional thoracic-lumbar spine MDCT demonstrated no difference in fracture detection rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-thoracic-and-lumbar-spinal-column-injury/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>AP and lateral plain radiographs of the thoracic and lumbar spine are generally sufficient to assess for the presence of injury in patients at lower risk. CT imaging is then obtained of areas with abnormal findings. Unfortunately, a review of 69 publications describing blunt injuries to the thoracolumbar spine failed to clearly define the criteria to determine who should get plain radiographs versus CT scans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-thoracic-and-lumbar-spinal-column-injury/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>The best evidence available to guide decision-making about diagnostic imaging in patients with suspected TL injury is from a prospective study performed at 13 trauma centers in the United States that included 499 patients with TL injuries, 264 of whom required surgical management (29.2 percent) or rigid spine immobilization (TL spine orthosis, TLSO) (70.8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-thoracic-and-lumbar-spinal-column-injury/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

For patients who have sustained significant blunt TL trauma based upon mechanism or clinical findings and for obtunded patients, we suggest CT imaging be used to assess the TL spine. Reformatted images from standard CT studies of the chest and abdomen are preferred. Reformatted CT images provide accurate images without the need for additional radiation exposure.</p><p>Several studies support this approach:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A systematic review found superior sensitivity and interobserver reliability in detecting TL spine injury with reformatted CT images compared with plain radiographs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-thoracic-and-lumbar-spinal-column-injury/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

This was shown in an observational study in which 78 of 80 fractures of the TL spine were correctly identified using images from chest, abdomen, and pelvis CTs without reformatting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-thoracic-and-lumbar-spinal-column-injury/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Both missed injuries were minor fractures involving the transverse process in patients with multiple other spinal injuries.</p><p>Analyses of cost effectiveness comparing CT to plain radiographs of the TL spine report that although CT has a higher initial fixed cost, this is offset by a reduced need for repeat radiographic examinations due to inadequate studies, lower medicolegal costs (including costs of prolonged hospitalizations, rehabilitation, lost productivity, and malpractice suits from missed injuries), and fixed personnel costs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-thoracic-and-lumbar-spinal-column-injury/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>].</p><p>Investigators have found that a CT obtained for the evaluation of chest and an abdominal injury provides sufficient data to screen for spinal fractures, thereby decreasing the time and cost of spine injury evaluation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective review of 3537 blunt trauma patients of whom 236 (7 percent) sustained a cervical, thoracic, or lumbar fracture, researchers found that CT identified 99.3 percent of all fractures.

CT of the TL spine involves approximately 6 mSv of radiation exposure (range of 1.5 to 10 mSv, depending upon technique and other factors), compared with approximately 1.5 mSv (range of 0.5 to 1.8 mSv) using plain radiographs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-thoracic-and-lumbar-spinal-column-injury/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24263064\"><span class=\"h1\">MRI FOR THORACIC AND LUMBAR SPINAL COLUMN INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) can be used to evaluate the integrity of the spinal ligaments and surrounding soft tissues in a patient with spinal column trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-thoracic-and-lumbar-spinal-column-injury/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. However, vertebral fractures are better characterized by CT, and MRI examination is often felt to be unnecessary for the management and treatment of specific fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-thoracic-and-lumbar-spinal-column-injury/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. When CT or plain radiographs demonstrate a thoracolumbar burst fracture, MRI is often used to characterize the integrity of the posterior ligamentous complex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-thoracic-and-lumbar-spinal-column-injury/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. MRI is necessary to assess the spinal cord of any trauma patient with neurologic deficits or symptoms that suggest spinal cord injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-thoracic-and-lumbar-spinal-column-injury/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-traumatic-spinal-cord-injury#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute traumatic spinal cord injury&quot;, section on 'Magnetic resonance imaging'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7762960\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIVE MANAGEMENT AND DISPOSITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The disposition of patients with spinal column injury depends primarily upon fracture stability and concomitant injuries. If a spinal column injury is deemed unstable, hospital admission and spine surgery consultation is mandatory. If consultation is not available onsite, immediate transfer must be arranged to a center that can provide these services. Patients with unstable fractures have commonly sustained multi-system trauma, and the extent of their other injuries determines whether they require admission to an intensive care unit or other monitored setting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of trauma in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-inpatient-management-in-the-adult-trauma-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of inpatient management in the adult trauma patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Nonoperative management of thoracic and lumbar spinal fractures involves the use of a spinal orthotic vest or brace. The goals of operative and nonoperative surgical intervention in spinal column injuries are to decompress neural structures, stabilize unstable segments, and restore alignment of the vertebrae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-thoracic-and-lumbar-spinal-column-injury/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p>In 2005, the Thoracolumbar Injury Classification and Severity Score (TLICS) was proposed to delineate neurologic and spinal stability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-thoracic-and-lumbar-spinal-column-injury/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>]. The score is calculated based upon injury morphology, integrity of the posterior ligamentous complex, and neurologic status, and has demonstrated good reliability and reproducibility. A score greater than 4 suggests significant instability warranting surgical treatment. </p><p>Some critics of the TLICS claim that it relies too heavily on evaluation of the posterolateral ligament complex. An alternative classification system - the AOSpine Thoracolumbar Spine Injury Classification - has been proposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-thoracic-and-lumbar-spinal-column-injury/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. This system classifies injuries according to one of three main injury groups (compression, tension band, or translation), the patients&rsquo; neurologic status, and two other clinical modifiers. Prospective validation of this system is needed. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7762981\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Injuries of the thoracolumbar (TL) spinal column are less common than cervical injuries, but can produce devastating neurologic injury. They are commonly associated with major injuries of the chest, abdomen, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pelvis following high-energy trauma. Motor vehicle crash is the most common cause. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spinal-column-injuries-in-adults-definitions-mechanisms-and-radiographs\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spinal column injuries in adults: Definitions, mechanisms, and radiographs&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H1101779\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In all cases of possible spinal column injury, spinal immobilization must be maintained until the possibility of injury is excluded by clinical or radiographic means. However, such patients may be removed from the hard long spine board onto a firm, flat mattress using the log-roll technique, as prolonged immobilization on the long board is associated with aspiration and pressure sores.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Back pain, back deformity, and neurologic dysfunction are among the most common clinical findings associated with TL spinal column injuries. A significant portion of TL fractures damage the distal spinal cord or cauda equina to some degree, and such injuries can present with lower extremity paresis, lower extremity or saddle anesthesia, or loss of bladder or rectal continence. Other signs suggestive of injury include contusions, abrasions, lacerations, open wounds, or muscle spasm in the general area of the spine. (See <a href=\"#H7763254\" class=\"local\">'Clinical evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Effective decision rules to determine the need for imaging in patients with possible TL spinal column injury await development. Until better evidence is available to guide practice, we believe it is reasonable to obtain radiographic studies of the thoracic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lumbar spine when any one of the following high-risk criteria exists:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Focal pain or tenderness over the TL spine</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Signs of injury (eg, step-off, bruising, hematoma) along the TL spine</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Neurologic deficit consistent with TL injury</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>High-force mechanism (fall greater than 3 m (10 feet); ejection from a vehicle; moderate or high-velocity motor vehicle crash; auto versus pedestrian)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Painful distracting injury (particularly when elements of the mechanism or clinical evaluation suggest increased risk for TL injury)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Presence of another spine injury, particularly a cervical spine fracture (see <a href=\"#H7762768\" class=\"local\">'Decision rules for imaging thoracic or lumbar spine injury'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with major trauma, high-risk features, or depressed mental status, CT is used to assess the TL spine. When available, reconstructed images obtained from multidetector CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis performed as part of the patient's general trauma evaluation should be used. AP and lateral plain radiographs of the thoracic and lumbar spine are generally sufficient to assess for the presence of injury in patients at lower risk. CT imaging is then obtained of areas with abnormal findings.
