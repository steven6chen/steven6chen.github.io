The alert was based upon the preliminary results of a randomized trial of over 6000 patients with gout and a history of major cardiovascular disease; the full report of the trial has now been published [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-rheumatology/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The rates of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality were greater with febuxostat than with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allopurinol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">allopurinol</a>, with differences in the absolute risks, respectively, of 1.2 and 1.4 percent. The safety trial was not placebo controlled; thus, it remains unclear whether allopurinol had beneficial effects on mortality or whether febuxostat had deleterious effects. These findings reinforce our preference for allopurinol as the initial urate-lowering drug for most patients with gout, especially those with high cardiovascular risk. Until further information is available, treatment decisions in patients already taking febuxostat should be individualized and include discussion of safety concerns raised by the FDA, the availability and risks of alternative therapies, and the patient's cardiovascular risk.

Glucocorticoids or other treatments may be effective, but some patients have required discontinuation, usually temporarily, of their ICI. In a recent systematic review of multiple case reports, case series, and observational studies including over 120 patients with autoimmune diseases who were treated with ICIs, three-quarters of whom had exacerbation of the preexisting autoimmune disease, immune-related adverse events (irAE), or both, fewer irAE were seen in patients receiving immunosuppressive therapy at the time ICIs were started [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-rheumatology/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Less than 20 percent required immunosuppressive therapies other than glucocorticoids for management of these occurrences. Half of the patients did not require ICI discontinuation.

We favor preoperative antimicrobial prophylaxis in such cases because of the relatively high rates of surgical site infection (SSI) described, despite its classification as a &ldquo;clean&rdquo; surgical procedure (for which preoperative prophylaxis is not routinely recommended by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention). This remains our approach even though a randomized trial including more than 470 patients who underwent removal of orthopedic implants reported no difference in the overall SSI rate with preoperative <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefazolin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefazolin</a> versus placebo (13 versus 15 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-rheumatology/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Administration of infliximab within four weeks before surgery was not associated with a higher risk of postoperative infection or prosthetic joint infection within one year when compared with no administration for 8 to 12 weeks prior to surgery.

In the largest nationwide population-based study using data from US residents between 1968 and 2013, the rates of SLE mortality have decreased overall but remain high relative to the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-rheumatology/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In addition, SLE mortality rates were higher among women, African Americans, and residents of the southern US.

In a randomized trial of subcutaneous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tocilizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tocilizumab</a> (TCZ), a humanized anti-human IL-6 receptor antibody, patients with refractory Takayasu arteritis were assigned to receive either weekly TCZ or placebo along with a mandatory glucocorticoid taper, and were monitored for time to relapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-rheumatology/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Although the primary outcome was not met, there was a trend favoring TCZ over placebo for time to relapse, without any additional safety concerns. Limitations of the study include the small sample size and the use of a mandatory glucocorticoid taper. More data are needed to help determine whether TCZ will have a role in the routine care of patients with refractory Takayasu arteritis.

A randomized trial in 95 patients with nonsevere disease (51 with EGPA, 25 with MPA, and 19 with PAN) found that the addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> to standard daily oral glucocorticoids did not improve remission rates, lower relapse risk, spare steroids, or reduce the EGPA <span class=\"nowrap\">asthma/rhinosinusitis</span> exacerbation rate when compared with placebo at two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-rheumatology/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

The first study to provide data on the risk of bleeding in patients on direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) undergoing joint aspiration or injection is a retrospective review of 1050 consecutive procedures from Mayo Clinic over a six-year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-rheumatology/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].
