Extracorporeal methods to remove serum free light chains (SFLCs), such as plasmapheresis and high-cutoff dialysis, can be used as adjunctive therapy. The benefits of extracorporeal light chain removal remain undetermined; however, the majority of UpToDate authors support its use. In patients who are unresponsive to therapy despite adequate suppression and removal of SFLCs, a kidney biopsy (if not yet performed) is typically performed to investigate causes other than light chain cast nephropathy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3278055004\"><span class=\"h4\">Anti-myeloma therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with light chain cast nephropathy should receive bortezomib-based chemotherapy with high-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bortezomib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bortezomib</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, and dexamethasone, or CyBorD) as rapidly as possible to decrease light chain production (with the possible exception of patients who are in preterminal stages of disease) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-kidney-disease-in-multiple-myeloma-and-other-monoclonal-gammopathies/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].

This is different than the usual weekly administration of these agents in patients with multiple myeloma without AKI. However, beginning with the second cycle, these agents are administered as they are in patients with multiple myeloma who do not have AKI. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lenalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Lenalidomide</a> is typically avoided in patients with AKI unless the patient is refractory to other options (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-protocols-for-multiple-myeloma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment protocols for multiple myeloma&quot;</a>).

This regimen requires careful monitoring and may require modification in patients who cannot excrete the administered fluid because of renal or heart failure. A loop diuretic should be reserved for patients who develop hypervolemia.

Among patients with AKI who require dialysis, hemodialysis is the preferred modality. Peritoneal dialysis is an option for patients who develop end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and require chronic dialysis.

High-cutoff dialysis employs dialyzers with pore sizes that are significantly larger than those of standard high-flux dialyzers and which permit the efficient passage of proteins as large as 25 to 50 kilodaltons. The larger pore size allows a higher rate of SFLC removal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-kidney-disease-in-multiple-myeloma-and-other-monoclonal-gammopathies/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. High-cutoff dialyzers are not available in the United States but are available in Europe.</p><p>If used, extracorporeal free light chain removal should be performed in conjunction with bortezomib- and dexamethasone-containing chemotherapy, which is needed to reduce the rate of light chain production, rather than being performed without chemotherapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selection-of-initial-chemotherapy-for-symptomatic-multiple-myeloma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selection of initial chemotherapy for symptomatic multiple myeloma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The benefit of extracorporeal free light chain removal in patients with AKI has <strong>not</strong> been established. Thus, the use of extracorporeal methods in the treatment of light chain cast nephropathy remains controversial, and some clinicians do not use these therapies in this setting.</p><p>However, given a <strong>possible</strong> reduction in dialysis dependency among survivors, the majority of authors of this topic suggest the use of extracorporeal light chain removal, using plasmapheresis or high-cutoff hemodialysis, in individuals with AKI who have a diagnosis of light chain cast nephropathy. The authors recognize that the strength of this recommendation is weak.

However, the duration of plasmapheresis should be guided by SFLC levels, which we measure daily. The plasmapheresis prescription is presented elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=therapeutic-apheresis-plasma-exchange-or-cytapheresis-indications-and-technology#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Therapeutic apheresis (plasma exchange or cytapheresis): Indications and technology&quot;, section on 'Technology'</a>.)</p><p>The goal of plasmapheresis is a 50 to 60 percent or greater reduction in the pathogenic SFLC level; this degree of light chain reduction is associated with recovery of renal function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-kidney-disease-in-multiple-myeloma-and-other-monoclonal-gammopathies/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. If the SFLC level is not reduced to this degree after five to seven plasmapheresis treatments, it is likely that the concomitantly administered chemotherapy is not effectively controlling light chain production. Alternative treatments are warranted in such patients. Some patients are dependent upon plasmapheresis to lower SFLC levels; in these patients, the decision to continue plasmapheresis is based upon the availability of other chemotherapeutic options. If other treatment options are available, we continue plasmapheresis; otherwise, we stop plasmapheresis.</p><p>In patients who also require dialysis on the same day, dialysis should be performed after plasmapheresis. Dialysis corrects the alkalemia that can develop among patients receiving citrate anticoagulation with plasmapheresis. (See <a href=\"#H3907310512\" class=\"local\">'Dialysis'</a> above.)</p><p>If plasmapheresis is initiated following a kidney biopsy, there is a potential risk of postbiopsy bleeding from pheresis-induced removal of coagulation factors. Partial replacement of the fluid removed with fresh-frozen plasma (1 to 2 liters toward the end of the pheresis) rather than albumin should attenuate the coagulopathy. Replacement with fresh-frozen plasma may also be reasonable for the final treatment prior to catheter removal.

Clinicians who have access to high-cutoff dialyzers and wish to perform extracorporal light chain removal with high-cutoff hemodialysis should use the regimen described in the Studies in Patients with Multiple Myeloma and Renal Failure Due to Myeloma Cast Nephropathy (MYRE) trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-kidney-disease-in-multiple-myeloma-and-other-monoclonal-gammopathies/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>] (see <a href=\"#H3600893756\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy studies'</a> below). In this randomized multicenter trial, patients with light chain cast nephropathy and severe AKI who were treated with high-cutoff hemodialysis received eight five-hour sessions (blood flow rate &ge;250 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> and dialysate flow rate &ge;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min)</span> over 10 days. If needed, patients received three additional weekly sessions until completion of three cycles of chemotherapy.</p><p>Patients treated with high-cutoff hemodialysis may develop hypoalbuminemia due to losses of albumin through the larger membrane pores.

If the SFLC level is not reduced to this degree after eight high-cutoff hemodialysis treatments, it is likely that the concomitantly administered chemotherapy is not effectively controlling light chain production, and alternative therapies may be warranted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3600893756\"><span class=\"h5\">Efficacy studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evidence evaluating the effectiveness of extracorporeal light chain removal in patients with AKI due to multiple myeloma is conflicting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-kidney-disease-in-multiple-myeloma-and-other-monoclonal-gammopathies/abstract/4,6,8,13,15-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6,8,13,15-20</a>], and some patients clearly improve without treatment with extracorporeal methods. However, substantial benefit in renal outcomes has been shown in some studies that enrolled patients who had circulating free light chains in the plasma or significant Bence Jones proteinuria. The following studies illustrate the range of findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One randomized trial involved 29 patients with multiple myeloma, AKI, and significant Bence Jones proteinuria, 24 of whom required dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-kidney-disease-in-multiple-myeloma-and-other-monoclonal-gammopathies/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The patients were randomly assigned to plasmapheresis (for five consecutive days) together with glucocorticoids, cytotoxic drugs, and hemodialysis (if required) or to glucocorticoids, cytotoxic drugs, and peritoneal dialysis (if required). Among the 15 patients randomly assigned to receive plasmapheresis, 13 (87 percent) recovered renal function (most to a plasma creatinine concentration of &lt;2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [&lt;220 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L]),</span> whereas improvement occurred in only 2 of 14 controls (14 percent), with most patients requiring chronic dialysis.

The following additional results were noted:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The composite outcome (death, dialysis dependence, or glomerular filtration rate [GFR] of &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>) was not significantly different (58 versus 69 percent in the plasmapheresis and control patients, respectively [95% CI -8.3 to 29.1 percent]).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Among six-month survivors, fewer patients in the plasmapheresis group remained dialysis dependent, but the difference was not significant (13 versus 27 percent, respectively [95% CI -5.1 to 34.6 percent]).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, it is uncertain that all patients in this trial had light chain cast nephropathy as the cause of AKI and, therefore, not all patients would have benefited from plasmapheresis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-kidney-disease-in-multiple-myeloma-and-other-monoclonal-gammopathies/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Only 78 percent of the patients had increased free light chains in the plasma, and only 61 percent had light chains in the urine; relatively few patients had a tissue diagnosis of cast nephropathy by biopsy. The potential benefits of plasmapheresis may also have been obscured since more patients in the control group received a dexamethasone-containing regimen, which leads to faster reduction in light chain production than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=melphalan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">melphalan</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>.

Fourteen patients had biopsy-proven cast nephropathy and SFLCs measured before and after plasmapheresis. A renal response, defined as a 50 percent reduction in serum creatinine and dialysis independence at 180 days, occurred in seven of nine patients (77.8 percent) in whom SFLCs were reduced by 50 percent or more.

All patients received bortezomib-based antimyeloma therapy and were randomly assigned to receive intensive hemodialysis (eight five-hour sessions over 10 days) with either a high-cutoff dialyzer (46 patients) or a conventional high-flux dialyzer (48 patients). Although high-cutoff hemodialysis produced a greater reduction in SFLCs (68 versus 31 percent) after the first hemodialysis session, there was no significant difference in the primary endpoint of hemodialysis independence at three months between the two groups (41 versus 33 percent for high-cutoff and conventional hemodialysis, respectively). At 6 and 12 months, however, rates of hemodialysis independence were higher among patients in the high-cutoff group compared with those in the conventional hemodialysis group (57 versus 35 percent at 6 months and 61 versus 38 percent at 12 months).

At three months, there was no difference in renal function recovery between the two groups (56 versus 52 percent for high-cutoff and conventional hemodialysis, respectively), and patients in the high-cutoff group had a higher rate of lung infections. Among patients who recovered renal function, estimated GFR at two years was comparable between the two groups.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">These trials are small in size and have produced conflicting results.

Thus, additional studies are needed to clarify the role of extracorporeal removal of free light chains in patients with light chain cast nephropathy. Since the overall risks are low and potential benefits in terms of reversing renal dysfunction are high, the results of the MYRE trial support our suggestion to perform extracorporeal light chain removal, using either plasmapheresis or high-cutoff dialysis, in patients with light chain cast nephropathy.

A wide range of renal manifestations and pathologies involving different mechanisms have been described with these disorders. Kidney injury most often occurs in patients with a high tumor burden and can evolve as either an acute or chronic disorder.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3136121310\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute (AKI) or subacute kidney injury</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with multiple myeloma who have a confirmed or suspected diagnosis of light chain cast nephropathy, we use the following approach:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We recommend anti-myeloma therapy with bortezomib-based chemotherapy with high-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bortezomib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bortezomib</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, and dexamethasone, or CyBorD) rather than other anti-myeloma chemotherapy regimens (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). This therapy should be initiated as rapidly as possible to decrease light chain production. (See <a href=\"#H3278055004\" class=\"local\">'Anti-myeloma therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We administer intravenous or oral fluid therapy, with the goal of attaining a daily urine output of approximately <strong>3 liters</strong>, unless contraindicated (eg, heart failure or persistent oligoanuric AKI). If volume depletion is clinically present, we provide isotonic fluids for initial volume replacement. In the absence of (or following the correction of) volume depletion, we administer one-half isotonic saline at an initial rate of 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour,</span> adjusted to maintain the urine output at approximately 100 to 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/hour</span> (approximately 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/day)</span>. We reserve the use of loop diuretics for patients who develop hypervolemia. (See <a href=\"#H3833010901\" class=\"local\">'Fluid management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">In patients with AKI and oliguria, we still administer the fluid regimen described above. Within 24 hours, reversal of oliguria should become evident. If oliguria persists, fluid administration should be modified or discontinued to prevent volume overload.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We discontinue all potentially nephrotoxic agents, including nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We correct hypercalcemia, if present. (See <a href=\"#H3429452462\" class=\"local\">'Hypercalcemia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Dialysis should be initiated for the usual indications (eg, fluid overload, hyperkalemia, and uremia) and not for the removal of free light chains. Among patients with AKI who require dialysis, hemodialysis is the preferred modality. Peritoneal dialysis is an option for patients who develop end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and require chronic dialysis. (See <a href=\"#H3907310512\" class=\"local\">'Dialysis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We suggest the use of extracorporeal light chain removal using plasmapheresis or, where available, high-cutoff hemodialysis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). This is based upon a <strong>possible</strong> reduction in dialysis dependency among survivors. However, the use of extracorporeal methods in the treatment of light chain cast nephropathy remains controversial, and some clinicians do not use these therapies in this setting. The suggested plasmapheresis and high-cutoff-dialysis regimens and therapeutic goals are presented in detail above. Plasmapheresis and high-cutoff hemodialysis must always be used with early institution of regimens designed to reduce light chain production, most commonly bortezomib-based regimens. (See <a href=\"#H2929293904\" class=\"local\">'Extracorporeal methods for light chain removal'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients at high risk for light chain cast nephropathy, we usually treat with intravenous fluids, unless contraindicated, to prevent volume depletion and maintain a high urine output (approximately 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/day)</span>. We also treat with bortezomib- and dexamethasone-based chemotherapy (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bortezomib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bortezomib</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a>). (See <a href=\"#H950515970\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with AKI due to hypercalcemia, we treat with isotonic fluids, glucocorticoids, and, depending upon the serum calcium concentration, bisphosphonates (preferably <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pamidronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pamidronate</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3429452462\" class=\"local\">'Hypercalcemia'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-the-complications-of-multiple-myeloma#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of the complications of multiple myeloma&quot;, section on 'Hypercalcemia'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H810058152\"><span class=\"h2\">Albuminuria or nephrotic syndrome</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Proteinuria or nephrotic syndrome in patients with multiple myeloma or other monoclonal gammopathies can be caused by a number of different mechanisms, including amyloidosis, monoclonal immunoglobulin deposition disease (MIDD), and, less commonly, monoclonal cryoglobulinemia, membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis, fibrillary glomerulonephritis, and immunotactoid glomerulopathy. A kidney biopsy is required to establish a diagnosis. Treatment of these disorders should be directed at eliminating the clonal proliferation of plasma cells or B cells that is responsible for producing the pathogenic monoclonal protein. In general, this involves the administration of chemotherapeutic agents.
