When excessive intestinal gas does occur, it may be due to excessive air swallowing, increased intraluminal production from malabsorbed nutrients, decreased gas absorption due to obstruction, or expansion of intraluminal gas due to changes in atmospheric pressure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F81749\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81749 \">table 1</a>). The understanding of intestinal gas syndromes has been aided by studies of intestinal gas composition and volume in normal individuals and in those with complaints of &quot;too much gas.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">AMOUNT OF GAS IN THE INTESTINE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The volume of gas in the intestinal tract, as determined by body plethysmography or argon washout techniques, is approximately 200 mL in both the fasting and postprandial states [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-gas-and-bloating/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>], and in subjects who complain of gaseous distention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-gas-and-bloating/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Quantitative measurement of bowel gas has also been performed with digitized abdominal radiographs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-gas-and-bloating/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPOSITION OF INTESTINAL GAS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nitrogen (N<sub>2</sub>), oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>), carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>), hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>), and methane (CH<sub>4</sub>) account for more that 99 percent of expelled intestinal gas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-gas-and-bloating/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. One investigation using a gas washout technique revealed the composition of gas within the intestinal tract of 10 normal subjects to be predominantly N<sub>2 </sub>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-gas-and-bloating/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Oxygen was present in very low concentrations, and the concentrations of CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>, and CH<sub>4</sub> were variable.</p><p>The composition of gas may vary in a given compartment of the gastrointestinal tract. As an example, stomach gas contains high concentrations of N<sub>2</sub> and O<sub>2 </sub>similar to the atmosphere, while flatus contains less O<sub>2</sub> and more CH<sub>4</sub>.</p><p>None of the principal gases has an odor. Minor constituents of flatus, to which odor may be attributable, include sulfur-containing compounds such as methanethiol, dimethyl sulfide, hydrogen sulfide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-gas-and-bloating/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>], as well as short-chain fatty acids, skatoles, indoles, volatile amines, and ammonia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">SOURCES OF INTESTINAL GAS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Air swallowing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Air swallowing or aerophagia is the major source of stomach gas. Several milliliters of air, mostly N<sub>2</sub>, are incorporated into each normal swallow. Larger amounts are swallowed when food is gulped. Aerophagia can be a manifestation of anxiety, and may also be enhanced by gum chewing and smoking. Most swallowed air appears to be eructated.</p><p>The most common symptoms of aerophagia in a series of 79 patients were belching (56 percent), bloating (27 percent) abdominal pain (19 percent), and abdominal distension (19 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-gas-and-bloating/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>A study evaluating the source of air in patients with excessive belching found that such patients tended to expel air that had reached the esophagus during swallowing rather than air that had reached the stomach. A study using cineradiography demonstrated that patients relax their upper esophageal sphincter, swallow air, and then release it from the esophagus before it reaches the stomach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-gas-and-bloating/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Some achieve this by creating a negative intrathoracic pressure, possibly by inspiring against a closed glottis, and then relaxing the upper esophageal sphincter to allow air to enter the esophagus. Others force air into their esophagus by simultaneously contracting the muscles of their pharynx, palate, and tongue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-gas-and-bloating/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Posture may influence the amount of swallowed air passing from the stomach into the small intestine. This occurs because in the supine position, gastric air is located above gastric liquid that overlies the gastroesophageal junction, causing air to pass preferentially into the small intestine.</p><p>Swallowed air is the major source of O<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub> in intestinal gas. Diffusion of these gases between the intestinal lumen and the bloodstream is determined by partial pressure gradients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Intraluminal production</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Three of the five principal gases, CO<sub>2</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>, and CH<sub>4</sub>, are produced within the bowel lumen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">CO2</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CO<sub>2</sub> is derived from digestion of fat and protein in the upper gastrointestinal tract, from bacterial fermentation of intraluminal substrates, or may be liberated from the interaction of acid and bicarbonate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-gas-and-bloating/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Much of the CO<sub>2</sub> produced in the upper small intestine is probably absorbed before it reaches the colon; CO<sub>2</sub> that is present in flatus is likely due to bacterial fermentation reactions in the colon. Increased CO<sub>2</sub> in flatus can result from specific dietary substrates, such as nondigestible carbohydrates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-gas-and-bloating/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">H2</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>H<sub>2</sub> production occurs predominantly in the colon, except under conditions of small intestine bacterial overgrowth when it is produced by bacterial fermentation in that portion of the gut [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-gas-and-bloating/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Ingested carbohydrate and protein are sources for H<sub>2</sub> production. Small intestinal carbohydrate malabsorption leads to increased delivery of carbohydrate to the colon and increased H<sub>2</sub> gas production (see <a href=\"#H1307548188\" class=\"local\">'Carbohydrate malabsorption'</a> below). In healthy individuals, certain foods with high concentrations of oligosaccharides such as stachyose and raffinose found in legumes, or resistant starches (flours made from wheat, oats, potatoes, and corn) cannot be completely digested by enzymes within the normal small bowel, leading to increased H<sub>2</sub> production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-gas-and-bloating/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Increased colonic H<sub>2</sub> production following carbohydrate ingestion forms the basis for the H<sub>2</sub> breath test for carbohydrate malabsorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-gas-and-bloating/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>H<sub>2</sub> is both produced and consumed by fecal bacteria; the net H<sub>2</sub> excretion is determined by these two processes. H<sub>2</sub> consumption occurs in the bacterial production of CH<sub>4</sub> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-gas-and-bloating/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], sulfide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-gas-and-bloating/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], and acetate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-gas-and-bloating/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. H<sub>2</sub> is excreted in the breath (after absorption into the bloodstream) or passed in flatus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Methane</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Methane, like H<sub>2</sub>, is exclusively a product of bacterial metabolism. The principal methanogenic bacterium is <em>Methanobrevibacter smithii</em>. Because <em>M. smithii</em> catalyzes the reaction: 4H<sub>2</sub> + CO<sub>2</sub> --&gt; CH<sub>4</sub> + 2H<sub>2</sub>0, it reduces the volume of gas that would otherwise be present in the colon. CH<sub>4</sub> may be absorbed into the portal circulation and excreted in expired air, or excreted in flatus.</p><p>The tendency to produce CH<sub>4</sub> is determined by the concentration of methanogens in the colon, and may be related to genetic or early environmental factors. The presence of bile acid in the colon may be important in the regulation of methanogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-gas-and-bloating/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The incidence of methane production is increased in individuals with colorectal cancer, extensive ulcerative colitis, and colonic polyps compared with individuals with other diseases of the colon or healthy volunteers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-gas-and-bloating/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1307548188\"><span class=\"h3\">Carbohydrate malabsorption</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Malabsorption of carbohydrates can lead to increased intraluminal gas and result in complaints of gas, abdominal pain, and flatulence. Unabsorbed carbohydrates provide a substrate for rapid bacterial fermentation (causing gas), and have other physiological consequences including an increased osmotic load, alteration of gastrointestinal motility, and a change in the profile of the bacterial flora. Patients with functional bowel disorders (such as irritable bowel syndrome) may have a heightened sensitivity to the effects of malabsorbed carbohydrate, even though the rates of carbohydrate malabsorption may not differ from healthy subjects.</p><p>Diagnosis of specific forms of carbohydrate malabsorption can be established with a breath test, although an empirical trial of dietary restriction may be sufficient. Thus, dietary evaluation and modification are useful approaches to medical management.

However, one blinded study of patients with self-reported &quot;severe lactose intolerance&quot; showed no difference in bloating or perceived severity or frequency of flatus after patients ingested 240 mL of conventional milk as compared with lactose-hydrolyzed milk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-gas-and-bloating/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

In contrast, rice and gluten-free wheat were absorbed completely.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bacterial fermentation of raffinose, stachyose, and verbascose, the undigestible oligosaccharides abundant in legumes, causes increased intestinal gas.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fructose malabsorption may be an underappreciated cause of gastrointestinal symptoms. Up to one-half of the population cannot completely absorb a load of 25 g of fructose while daily intake varies from about 11 to 54 g per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-gas-and-bloating/abstract/22-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Diffusion from the blood</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The partial pressure of intestinal gases determines the direction of diffusion of the gas between the intestinal lumen and the bloodstream.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>H<sub>2</sub> and CH<sub>4</sub> have high partial pressures in the intestinal lumen as compared to the bloodstream and therefore diffuse readily out of the intestine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastric luminal oxygen is absorbed into the bloodstream since it has a relatively high partial pressure (due to its concentration in swallowed air). On the other hand, colonic luminal oxygen has a low partial pressure; it tends to diffuse from the blood into the lumen.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CO<sub>2</sub> has a variable pattern of diffusion. The partial pressure of CO<sub>2</sub> in the gastric lumen is lower than that of the blood; thus, CO<sub>2</sub> tends to diffuse into the gastric lumen.

It may be voluntary or involuntary. Involuntary belching typically follows a meal and is caused by the release of swallowed air after gastric distention.</p><p>Belching may be facilitated by foods that relax the lower esophageal sphincter, such as chocolate, fats, and mints [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-gas-and-bloating/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Chronic, repetitive belching is a disorder caused by habitual air swallowing (aerophagia) in which air may transit only to the esophagus before being vented, a variant referred to as supragastric belching. In these patients, belching frequently becomes habitual and may be incorrectly regarded as indicative of underlying digestive problems. Episodes of supragastric belching occur more frequently than those of gastric belching.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnostic evaluation of patients with chronic eructation should be reserved for those patients who have additional symptoms suggesting underlying pathology. </p><p>According to the Rome IV criteria, belching disorder is defined as bothersome (ie, severe enough to impact usual activities) belching from the esophagus or stomach more than three days a week [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-gas-and-bloating/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. These criteria should be fulfilled for the last three months with symptom onset at least six months before diagnosis. </p><p>Depending on the origin of the refluxed gas, belching disorder is classified into:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excessive supragastric belching (from esophagus)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excessive gastric belching (from stomach)</p><p/><p>Supragastric belching is supported by observing frequent, repetitive belching. Gastric belching has no established clinical correlate. Objective intraluminal impedance testing can be used to distinguish supragastric from gastric belching. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of chronic eructation consists of breaking the vicious cycle of aerophagia by explaining the process to the patient and making specific recommendations where appropriate. These include discontinuation of such habits as gum chewing, smoking, drinking carbonated beverages, and gulping food and liquids. Specific treatment of anxiety should be considered if this is a prominent symptom. Reassurance that isolated belching is a benign condition may help relieve underlying anxiety. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=baclofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Baclofen</a> treatment (10 mg three times daily) has been reported to reduce supragastric belching and aerophagia, and can be tried when behavioral approaches are unsuccessful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-gas-and-bloating/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Flatulence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The volume of gas passed per rectum varies from about 500 to 1500 mL per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-gas-and-bloating/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The frequency of flatus released varies between 10 and 20 times per day in healthy subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-gas-and-bloating/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Most patients who report excessive flatulence fall within this range.</p><p>Although excessive passage of flatus or its foul odor may be a source of embarrassment to the patient, it is rarely associated with serious illness. Offensive odor, when present, may be due to sulfur-containing compounds, such as methanethiol, dimethyl sulfide, and hydrogen sulfide, as well as short-chain fatty acids, skatoles, indoles, volatile amines, and ammonia.</p><p>A number of factors may account for a patient's awareness of bothersome flatus:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An alteration of intestinal motility or bacteria.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dietary factors, such as an increased intake of lactose, fructose, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorbitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorbitol</a>; undigestible starches in fruits, vegetables, and legumes; and carbonated beverages.

This may include stool examination for fat and <em>Giardia</em>, a lactose tolerance test, celiac serology, and a small bowel radiograph or upper endoscopy (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-malabsorption\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of malabsorption&quot;</a>).

Limiting dietary ingestion of known gas-producing foods such as cabbage, onions, broccoli, brussel sprouts, wheat, and potatoes should be recommended as a therapeutic trial. A low FODMAP diet is low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols. It has been demonstrated to reduce abdominal pain, bloating, and flatulence in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F90186\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90186 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-gas-and-bloating/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Abdominal distension has been well documented in a subset of patients with irritable bowel syndrome by both plethysmography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-gas-and-bloating/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>] and abdominal CT imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-gas-and-bloating/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. One proposed mechanism for abdominal distention is incoordination of the abdomino-phrenic reflex. Investigators found that subjects with bloating and distention respond to modest increases in intraluminal gas by evidencing downward rather than upward displacement of their diaphragm, resulting in visible protrusion of the anterior abdominal wall. In contrast, patients with measureable gut dysmotility harbor larger volumes of intraluminal gas during bloating episodes, resulting in excessive abdominal bulging despite normal cephalic displacement of the diaphragm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-gas-and-bloating/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>Trapping of gas at the colonic flexures may result in distension, spasm, and subsequent pain, the so-called hepatic and splenic flexure syndromes. In these syndromes, the segment of bowel proximal to the colonic flexure may be distended with air on abdominal plain film, but subsequent evaluation by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> enema reveals no focal lesions, thereby implicating spasm as the etiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-gas-and-bloating/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Instillation of air or barium may reproduce the symptoms. These syndromes are probably variants of irritable bowel syndrome, and anticonstipation therapy is sometimes effective.</p><p>Nissen fundoplication for GERD may result in the inability to belch because of the tightness of the wrap created by the surgeon. As a result of gastric distention, many postoperative patients experience bloating, abdominal pain, and excessive flatus, known as the gas-bloat syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-gas-and-bloating/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>], which may slowly improve with time.</p><p>These observations underscore that many patients with bloating often have no clearly identifiable abnormality and thus can be classified as having a functional disorder. </p><p>According to consensus criteria (Rome IV), functional bloating can be distinguished from other causes of abdominal distention by its diurnal pattern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-gas-and-bloating/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. It may follow ingestion of specific foods and sometimes be accompanied by excessive burping or flatus (but these may be unrelated to the sensation of bloating). Diarrhea, weight loss, or nutritional deficiency should prompt evaluation for other conditions. </p><p>Rome IV criteria for establishing the diagnosis of functional bloating include both of the following (for at least three months with symptom onset at least six months prior to diagnosis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intestinal-gas-and-bloating/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recurrent bloating or distension, on average, at least one <span class=\"nowrap\">day/week;</span> abdominal bloating <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> distension predominates over other symptoms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insufficient criteria for a diagnosis of IBS, functional constipation, functional diarrhea, or postprandial distress syndrome.</p><p/><p>Mild pain related to bloating may be present as well as minor bowel movement abnormalities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1307547838\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approach to treatment of abdominal distension and gaseousness is similar to that used in irritable bowel syndrome, including a trial of the FODMAP diet (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F90186\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90186 \">table 3</a>) (see <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-irritable-bowel-syndrome-in-adults#H86846749\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of irritable bowel syndrome in adults&quot;, section on 'Low FODMAP diet'</a>).

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When excessive intestinal gas occurs, it may be due to excessive air swallowing, increased intraluminal production from malabsorbed nutrients, decreased gas absorption due to obstruction, or expansion of intraluminal gas due to changes in atmospheric pressure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F81749\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81749 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Sources of intestinal gas'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The medical history should begin by determining whether there is actually passage of excessive gas (belching or flatus) or just a subjective sensation of bloating.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients who complain predominantly of belching, we suggest behavioral changes, which include avoidance of carbonated beverages, stress management, and discontinuation of gum-chewing (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Eructation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If patients who complain predominantly of flatus, we suggest dietary changes (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). These include a temporary trial of lactose and fructose avoidance, avoidance of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorbitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorbitol</a> (which may be contained in diet foods and chewing gum), avoidance of ingestion of foods known to promote gaseousness (such as legumes and cruciferous vegetables), and a diet low in fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides, and polyols (FODMAP) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F90186\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90186 \">table 3</a>).

Diagnosis of specific forms of carbohydrate malabsorption can also be established with a breath test, although an empirical trial of dietary restriction may be sufficient.
