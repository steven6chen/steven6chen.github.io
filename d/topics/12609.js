In addition, a variety of systemic (so-called &quot;extraglandular&quot;) manifestations may occur, including fatigue, musculoskeletal symptoms, rashes, and internal organ (eg, pulmonary, renal, hepatic, and neurologic) disease. There is also increased risk of non-Hodgkin B-cell lymphoma.</p><p>SS occurs in a primary form, not associated with other autoimmune rheumatic diseases, and in a secondary form, often associated with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), or systemic sclerosis.</p><p>An overview of the systemic treatment and prognosis of SS will be reviewed here. The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of SS and the treatment of dry eyes, dry mouth (including the use of muscarinic agonists such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pilocarpine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pilocarpine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cevimeline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cevimeline</a> as secretagogues), other nonocular sicca symptoms, and manifestations affecting other organs and tissues are described in detail separately.

The following general principles apply to the management of patients with SS:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation and management should be provided by a multidisciplinary team; a rheumatologist, an eye care professional, and a dentist or oral medicine specialist are often required for optimal care.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should undergo a thorough pretreatment evaluation to determine the severity and extent of disease. (See <a href=\"#H3257309714\" class=\"local\">'Pretreatment evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The approach to management is generally the same for primary or secondary SS and depends upon the severity of symptoms and the response to therapy (see <a href=\"#H1409114187\" class=\"local\">'Assessment of disease activity and severity'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1516419575\" class=\"local\">'Determining disease subset'</a> below):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>All patients benefit from nonpharmacologic and preventive interventions, including patient education regarding self-care measures, benefits of smoking cessation, counseling regarding diet and medication use, routine preventive care and immunizations, and pregnancy counseling. (See <a href=\"#H2611070015\" class=\"local\">'Nonpharmacologic and preventive interventions'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with mild SS, in whom sicca manifestations alone are present, without systemic manifestations and without glandular enlargement, may only require local treatment for ocular, oral, and other symptoms of dryness, in addition to monitoring of their condition and usual medical and dental preventive care. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-dry-eye-in-sjogrens-syndrome-general-principles-and-initial-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of dry eye in Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome: General principles and initial therapy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-dry-mouth-and-other-non-ocular-sicca-symptoms-in-sjogrens-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of dry mouth and other non-ocular sicca symptoms in Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with moderate to severe SS, including extraglandular involvement, may also benefit from systemic therapies, including the use of immunosuppressive <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> biologic agents.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3257309714\"><span class=\"h1\">PRETREATMENT EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pretreatment evaluation should include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Confirmation of the diagnosis of Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome (SS) and that the clinical manifestation targeted for treatment is due to SS (see <a href=\"#H2237820770\" class=\"local\">'Confirmation of the diagnosis'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assessment of disease activity, based upon features of the history and physical examination, laboratory testing, and histopathologic findings (see <a href=\"#H1409114187\" class=\"local\">'Assessment of disease activity and severity'</a> below and <a href=\"#H4118156094\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory evaluation'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1290632553\" class=\"local\">'Additional studies'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical determination of the disease subset, depending upon the presence or absence of glandular enlargement and the degree of systemic involvement (see <a href=\"#H1516419575\" class=\"local\">'Determining disease subset'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2237820770\"><span class=\"h2\">Confirmation of the diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Before initiating systemic immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive therapies for clinical manifestations of SS, the underlying diagnosis of SS should be confirmed and other causes excluded by performing a comprehensive evaluation, as described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-classification-of-sjogrens-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and classification of Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are potential pitfalls in the evaluation of this disease that can lead to an incorrect diagnosis. As examples, these include incorrect interpretation of the labial minor salivary gland biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-and-prognosis-of-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], reliance upon low titer test results for <span class=\"nowrap\">anti-SSA/Ro,</span> or the finding of <span class=\"nowrap\">anti-SSB/La</span> antibodies alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-and-prognosis-of-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. SS is frequently misdiagnosed as other disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or rheumatoid arthritis (RA), based upon the presence of a positive antinuclear antibody (ANA) or a positive rheumatoid factor (RF), even in clinical centers with great expertise in SS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-and-prognosis-of-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-classification-of-sjogrens-syndrome#H19530195\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and classification of Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic testing'</a>.)</p><p>Certain systemic and organ-based manifestations, such as chronic fatigue, joint and muscle pain, orthostatic intolerance, gastrointestinal dysmotility, and neuropathic pain, also need thorough evaluation with respect to their differential diagnosis and presumed etiology. Key considerations include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recognition that SS commonly overlaps with other connective tissue and autoimmune disorders that may cause additional morbidity. Examples include antisynthetase antibody in a patient with interstitial lung disease, anti-aquaporin-4 antibodies in a patient with myelitis, and an elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) in a patient with fatigue from coexistent Hashimoto thyroiditis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-in-adults#H17269459\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of dermatomyositis and polymyositis in adults&quot;, section on 'Antisynthetase syndrome'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transverse-myelitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transverse myelitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paraneoplastic-syndromes-affecting-the-spinal-cord-and-dorsal-root-ganglia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paraneoplastic syndromes affecting the spinal cord and dorsal root ganglia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disorders-that-cause-hypothyroidism#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disorders that cause hypothyroidism&quot;, section on 'Chronic autoimmune (Hashimoto's) thyroiditis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome: Extraglandular disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Knowledge that autoantibodies generally thought of as characteristic of other disorders such as anticyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP), anticentromere, and anti-DNA antibodies occur in a small minority of primary SS patients and may impact disease phenotype <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> portend the later development of a second rheumatic disease or overlap syndrome. This information can affect the choice of treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-sjogrens-syndrome-extraglandular-disease#H53038499\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome: Extraglandular disease&quot;, section on 'Autoantibodies'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-classification-of-sjogrens-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and classification of Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Awareness that the extraglandular manifestation presumed to be due to SS may sometimes arise from unrelated comorbid conditions rather than SS itself. One example is the finding of white matter lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of a patient with neurologic symptoms (eg, &quot;brain fog,&quot; headache), which are more likely related to age or coincidental hypertension, migraine headaches, hyperlipidemia, or another process. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-multiple-sclerosis-in-adults#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of multiple sclerosis in adults&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1409114187\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessment of disease activity and severity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Disease activity may be difficult to assess in most patients for whom the clinical course, dominated by sicca manifestations, is relatively stable. It is best judged by the history and physical examination. Markers of activity include inflammatory arthritis, intractable and incapacitating fatigue, salivary <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lacrimal gland enlargement, cutaneous eruptions of annular erythema or palpable purpura, new sensory loss, and leg ulcers.</p><p>Certain symptoms and laboratory markers, while useful, need to be interpreted with caution because they lack sensitivity and specificity (see <a href=\"#H4118156094\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory evaluation'</a> below). Common laboratory abnormalities such as hypergammaglobulinemia, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and RF are not always consistent and reliable markers of disease activity.</p><p>Fever, weight loss, severe anemia, splenomegaly, and clinically apparent generalized lymphadenopathy are uncommon manifestations of SS and should prompt concern for an alternative systemic rheumatic disease (such as systemic lupus) or an intercurrent complication (such as infection, malignancy, or drug toxicity).</p><p>For clinical trials, disease severity and activity may also be quantified with validated research tools: one assessing the patient's self-report of symptom severity, including dryness, pain, and fatigue, termed the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) Sj&ouml;gren's Syndrome Patient Reported Index (ESSPRI), and one scoring the extent of exocrine glandular enlargement, organ-specific manifestations, and certain laboratory abnormalities, termed the EULAR Sj&ouml;gren's Syndrome Disease Activity Index (ESSDAI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-and-prognosis-of-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The ESSPRI is a validated measure of symptom severity, whereas the ESSDAI is a validated measure of disease activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-and-prognosis-of-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. These measures have been developed for research purposes and are not used in routine clinical practice. The two measures are often not congruent since the subjective experience of dryness, fatigue, and pain correlates poorly with systemic markers of disease activity (eg, serologic testing) and the presence of extraglandular disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4118156094\"><span class=\"h3\">Laboratory evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to obtaining a detailed clinical history and performing a thorough physical exam, laboratory tests may be used to help assess disease activity and prognosis and monitor organ-specific complications (such as renal or hematologic). Since there is no single marker of disease activity, clinicians must interpret the laboratory results in the appropriate clinical context.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H106552902\"><span class=\"h4\">Testing for all patients at initial evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We obtain the following tests for all patients at the initial evaluation for SS:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Complete blood count</strong> &ndash; Leukopenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia are closely associated with systemic disease activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-and-prognosis-of-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acute phase reactants (ESR and CRP)</strong> &ndash; The ESR is often elevated in SS as a manifestation of hypergammaglobulinemia. The C-reactive protein (CRP) is not typically elevated in SS due to the disease alone.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Chemistry panel</strong> &ndash; Hypokalemia and low serum bicarbonate are manifestations of renal tubular acidosis; the serum creatinine may be elevated due to nephritis. Elevated liver function tests provide a clue to concurrent autoimmune liver disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Urinalysis with examination of urinary sediment</strong> &ndash; Proteinuria or cellular casts and hematuria may be due to nephritis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Serologies</strong> &ndash; We order ANA, <span class=\"nowrap\">anti-SSA/Ro,</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">anti-SSB/La,</span> and RF as initial screening tests for SS. <span class=\"nowrap\">Anti-SSA/Ro</span> antibodies are a key criterion for the classification of SS in the 2016 American College of Rheumatology <span class=\"nowrap\">(ACR)/EULAR</span> set [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-and-prognosis-of-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. ANA tests performed by immunofluorescence assay are preferred over those done by solid phase assay since they are more sensitive and the immunofluorescent staining pattern may serve to identify specific ANAs, such as anticentromere antibodies, which are relevant to SS disease subset. <span class=\"nowrap\">Anti-SSA/Ro</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">anti-SSB/La</span> antibodies can be detected in patients with negative ANA tests; thus, the algorithm for screening for SS is different than what is recommended in &quot;Choosing Wisely&quot; test algorithms for systemic rheumatic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-and-prognosis-of-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Exclusion of disease mimics</strong> &ndash; We routinely obtain serologic testing for hepatitis C in all patients and for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) in at-risk individuals.

Such disease confirmation is important for those patients with systemic manifestations for whom immunosuppressive therapies are being considered. The biopsy also offers useful prognostic information, since the presence of germinal center-like structures and a focus score &gt;3 per 4 mm<sup>2</sup> (ie, at least three periductal lymphoid aggregates per 4 mm<sup>2</sup> of glandular tissue section) are associated with an increased risk of lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-and-prognosis-of-sjogrens-syndrome/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].
