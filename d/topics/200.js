We provide our patients with a wallet card that explains the condition, provides our contact information, and emphasizes the need for an immediate complete blood count (CBC) with platelet count and triage to a physician who can assess the possibility of relapse. A sample that can be used is provided in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F116336\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef116336 \">form 1</a>). Early involvement of the patient's treating clinician and the consulting specialist is advised. If the facility does not have the ability to perform urgent plasma exchange (PEX), the patient is likely to require urgent transfer to a facility that can provide this treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1802177\"><span class=\"h1\">MONITORING AND THERAPY AFTER RESPONSE TO TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two aspects of monitoring after a patient has been treated for an episode of TTP, which are discussed in the following sections:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Monitoring the patient for clinical signs of relapse</strong> &ndash; The patient's symptoms and complete blood count (CBC) are evaluated frequently during the initial recovery period for the purpose of detecting a clinical exacerbation or relapse (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F116648\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116648 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4016008308\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring the patient and the CBC'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Monitoring ADAMTS13 activity</strong> &ndash; ADAMTS13 activity is monitored periodically to identify changes that might portend an increased risk of relapse (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F116648\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116648 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H321962\" class=\"local\">'ADAMTS13 monitoring'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4016008308\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring the patient and the CBC</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient's symptoms and complete blood count (CBC) are evaluated during the initial recovery period for the purpose of detecting a clinical relapse (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F116648\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116648 \">table 1</a>). The intensity of monitoring is initially very frequent (see <a href=\"#H4518755\" class=\"local\">'First week'</a> below and <a href=\"#H4518761\" class=\"local\">'First month'</a> below). Intervals between evaluations can be extended over time but should never be discontinued, because relapse episodes can occur many years after recovery (see <a href=\"#H1803474\" class=\"local\">'First year'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1803481\" class=\"local\">'Subsequent years'</a> below). As an example, a patient in our practice had a relapse 16 years after treatment (the longest interval in our experience).</p><p>When disease responds to treatment, plasma exchange (PEX) is stopped and immunosuppressive therapy is continued as outlined below (see <a href=\"#H2928302599\" class=\"local\">'Treatment during remission to prevent relapse'</a> below). The patient usually can be discharged from the hospital. If the central venous catheter is in a subclavian or internal jugular vein, it may be left in place for several days after discharge until it is clear that the platelet count is not falling. The patient must be given explicit instructions on appropriate catheter care to prevent infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-ttp-initial-treatment#H3712582\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired TTP: Initial treatment&quot;, section on 'Platelet count increasing'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4518755\"><span class=\"h3\">First week</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most exacerbations of TTP occur during the first week after stopping PEX. Thus, patients are monitored closely for thrombocytopenia, which indicates persistent activity of the TTP episode (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F116648\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116648 \">table 1</a>). Patients are evaluated every two to three days for symptoms and platelet count (typically, as part of a CBC) to verify that the platelet count remains stable or continues to increase. Other laboratory tests are not necessary unless the platelet count decreases or the patient has symptoms of illness.</p><p>If the platelet count remains normal through the first three to five days after stopping PEX, the central venous catheter is removed. Although leaving the central venous catheter in place facilitates rapid reinitiation of PEX if thrombocytopenia recurs, catheter-associated sepsis is a common and critical problem. The central venous catheter is removed sooner if there are any signs of infection, such as redness or tenderness at the catheter insertion site, or any symptoms of systemic illness.</p><p>In our experience, 50 percent of patients treated for acquired TTP with PEX and glucocorticoids, without initial treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, have had an exacerbation of their disease after PEX was stopped [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-management-following-recovery-from-an-acute-episode-and-during-remission/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, we anticipate that the inclusion of rituximab as routine initial treatment together with PEX and glucocorticoids (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-ttp-initial-treatment#H495813\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired TTP: Initial treatment&quot;, section on 'Rituximab'</a>) will substantially reduce the risk for exacerbation.</p><p>Typically, exacerbation is characterized by a sharp decrease of the platelet count within the first week, which often occurs without any associated symptoms of TTP. If the platelet count decreases to <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;150,000/microL</span> but not less than <span class=\"nowrap\">100,000/microL</span> and the patient has no TTP symptoms, daily monitoring alone may be appropriate, as some patients will subsequently have a spontaneous recovery of the platelet count back to the normal range.</p><p>Disease exacerbation within the first month after stopping PEX is considered refractory disease (see <a href=\"#H4519123\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above). This requires immediate readmission to the hospital, reinitiation of PEX, and continuation of glucocorticoids and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-ttp-treatment-of-refractory-or-relapsed-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired TTP: Treatment of refractory or relapsed disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4518761\"><span class=\"h3\">First month</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For individuals who have a normal (or increasing) platelet count following the first week, we suggest tapering and discontinuing the glucocorticoids rapidly, over two to three weeks (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F116648\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116648 \">table 1</a>). This practice is based on our experience that the duration of the glucocorticoid taper does not alter the frequency of exacerbation or relapse and the expectation that a rapid taper will reduce glucocorticoid toxicities.</p><p>For <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, we use the conventional regimen (ie, 375 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> once per week for four weeks), although one of us (JNG) often gives the doses at shorter intervals to complete the regimen in two to three weeks. There is no evidence or experience that this is the optimal rituximab regimen for patients with TTP; lower <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fewer doses of rituximab may be equally effective. The platelet count should remain normal during this time. In some patients, the platelet count may exceed the baseline and then decrease or fluctuate before stabilizing in the patient's normal range. The interval of platelet count monitoring is gradually increased to once weekly and then to every other week.</p><p>If the serum creatinine <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) were abnormal at the time of hospital discharge, they are monitored until they become normal or another explanation for the abnormality is found. If the serum creatinine and LDH were normal at the time of hospital discharge, they do not require continued monitoring. The hemoglobin concentration generally will recover more slowly, and schistocytes may also persist for a few weeks. These features do not affect management.</p><p>We do not diagnose an exacerbation or resume PEX and glucocorticoids unless the platelet count decreases to <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;100,000/microL</span> or if symptoms suggestive of active TTP occur, such as any neurologic abnormalities, indicating refractory TTP. Once the platelet count has been maintained in the normal range for one month after discontinuing PEX, we are confident that a durable remission has occurred. (See <a href=\"#H4519123\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1803474\"><span class=\"h3\">First year</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with acquired TTP do not experience a relapse, and the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> as routine initial treatment is likely to make relapses less frequent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-management-following-recovery-from-an-acute-episode-and-during-remission/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-ttp-treatment-of-refractory-or-relapsed-disease#H328727\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired TTP: Treatment of refractory or relapsed disease&quot;, section on 'Risk of relapse'</a>.)</p><p>However, it is important to appreciate that any illness may trigger a relapse. Relapse may also be triggered by surgery or major trauma. Pregnancy is a special consideration because the risk for preeclampsia is increased, along with the risk for TTP relapse. (See <a href=\"#H397758\" class=\"local\">'Pregnancy after an episode of TTP'</a> below.)</p><p>Relapses are generally identified because the patient develops symptoms similar to their initial episode such as bruising, dark urine, neurologic symptoms, or unexplained severe fatigue; it is very rare to discover a relapse from a routine CBC in an asymptomatic patient. Thus, optimal care for the patient in remission requires an appropriate degree of attention to symptoms on the part of the patient, family members, and all clinicians involved in the patient's care. Any new symptoms require prompt measurement of the platelet count and immediate interventions for thrombocytopenia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-ttp-treatment-of-refractory-or-relapsed-disease#H395902\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired TTP: Treatment of refractory or relapsed disease&quot;, section on 'Relapse'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Patient</strong> &ndash; The patient must be responsible to seek medical attention immediately for any signs or symptoms of any illness, such as fever, abdominal pain, gastrointestinal symptoms, bruising, dark urine, neurologic symptoms, severe headache, or unexplained fatigue. The patient must insist on having a CBC with platelet count, even if symptoms seem minor; this may be facilitated by the use of a card that can be shown to emergency department personnel (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F116336\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef116336 \">form 1</a>). The results of the CBC must be available promptly (ie, the same day) to ensure that if thrombocytopenia is discovered, immediate evaluation for a relapse of TTP is undertaken. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-ttp-treatment-of-refractory-or-relapsed-disease#H395902\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired TTP: Treatment of refractory or relapsed disease&quot;, section on 'Relapse'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Family</strong> &ndash; Family members are also informed about the potential symptoms of relapse and the importance of obtaining a CBC and reviewing results on the same day they were obtained. Family members may help advocate for the patient and provide needed support.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Clinicians</strong> &ndash; The patient's primary care clinician typically begins to see the patient after the first month, together with the hematologist. All clinicians involved in the patient's care must be aware that the patient has a history of TTP and is at risk for relapse. It is especially important not to attribute minor symptoms such as nonspecific symptoms of tiredness, fatigue, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> gastrointestinal upset to a viral illness <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> to adopt a &quot;watch and wait&quot; approach for a patient with a history of TTP who has these symptoms. Unlike those in the general population, for an individual with a history of TTP, these symptoms must be managed as the possible initial evidence of a TTP relapse. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-ttp-treatment-of-refractory-or-relapsed-disease#H395902\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired TTP: Treatment of refractory or relapsed disease&quot;, section on 'Relapse'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hematologist</strong> &ndash; During the first year, it is appropriate for the hematologist to see the patient at intervals of several months. The hematologist may be called upon to facilitate rapid hospitalization and therapy if a relapse occurs. Because the risk for relapse persists for many years, we recommend that the hematologist continue to see patients annually indefinitely. Patients should always know how to contact their hematologist or hematologist practice at all times. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-ttp-treatment-of-refractory-or-relapsed-disease#H395902\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired TTP: Treatment of refractory or relapsed disease&quot;, section on 'Relapse'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Laboratory results</strong> &ndash; Many urgent care facilities and physician offices only receive laboratory results on the following day. For a patient with a history of TTP and suspected relapse, this is not adequate, because new thrombocytopenia is a medical emergency that may require immediate reinstitution of PEX.</p><p/><p>To facilitate these steps, we provide our patients with a letter that explains the diagnosis and required urgency of testing to share with any new clinician, as many clinicians are unfamiliar with TTP and may not accept a patient's explanation.</p><p>During the first year, the patient's primary clinician may also begin to manage the sequelae of TTP, such as minor cognitive impairment, major depression, and hypertension. (See <a href=\"#H4518797\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation for complications of TTP'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1803481\"><span class=\"h3\">Subsequent years</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TTP relapses become less likely as time passes, but in our experience, a first relapse may occur as long as 16 years following the initial episode.</p><p>As noted above, relapses are identified quickly when the patient pays close attention to their symptoms and their clinician (or emergency department personnel) addresses any potential symptoms of relapse promptly with a same-day evaluation and platelet count; this may be facilitated by carrying a wallet card (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F116336\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef116336 \">form 1</a>). It is important for the patient's hematologist and primary care clinician to collaborate closely. The hematologist must be accessible for any concerns about a relapse of TTP and must be prepared to ensure immediate hospitalization and effective treatment with PEX.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H321962\"><span class=\"h2\">ADAMTS13 monitoring</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3512473500\"><span class=\"h2\">Whether and when to test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our practice is to measure ADAMTS13 activity several weeks after the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> regimen has been completed, although we continue to reevaluate the optimal approach (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F116648\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116648 \">table 1</a>). If ADAMTS13 activity is normal, we repeat the measurement one month later. If that measurement is also normal, we repeat the measurements at three-month intervals for the first two years after remission was achieved. If all of these measurements have been normal, we then repeat ADAMTS13 measurements annually. With our experience that patients have had their first relapses over a wide interval (10 to 16 years after their initial episode), we consider ADAMTS13 measurement to be an appropriate part of the continuing annual evaluation.</p><p>However, there are several areas of uncertainty, and it is not clear whether this is the optimal approach, as discussed in the following sections. It is also not clear what intervention(s) are best for individuals who have asymptomatic declines in ADAMTS13 activity. Our approach to relapse prevention that incorporates ADAMTS13 measurements is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H2928302599\" class=\"local\">'Treatment during remission to prevent relapse'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H827632601\"><span class=\"h3\">Areas of uncertainty</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The accessibility and use of ADAMTS13 measurements are rapidly increasing. The importance of ADAMTS13 measurements for supporting the clinical diagnosis of TTP has been clearly established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-management-following-recovery-from-an-acute-episode-and-during-remission/abstract/2,4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,5</a>]. ADAMTS13 measurements are also becoming an important part of routine follow-up, as ADAMTS13 deficiency following a response to PEX can predict exacerbation, and ADAMTS13 deficiency during remission is a risk factor for relapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-management-following-recovery-from-an-acute-episode-and-during-remission/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. However, there are many uncertainties and questions about the measurement of ADAMTS13 activity during remission, such as the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is measurement of ADAMTS13 activity important following a disease response?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If so, when should ADAMTS13 activity first be measured?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How often should ADAMTS13 be measured?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Can ADAMTS13 measurements be discontinued, or should they continue indefinitely?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What value of ADAMTS13 during remission should cause concern about risk for relapse?</p><p/><p>The answers to these questions are not entirely clear, and more study is needed. However, it is worth noting that ADAMTS13 measurement following a response was important in a clinical trial of the monoclonal antibody caplacizumab; in that trial, persistent ADAMTS13 deficiency following a response to PEX, glucocorticoids, and caplacizumab predicted an exacerbation when caplacizumab was subsequently stopped (30 days after PEX was stopped) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-management-following-recovery-from-an-acute-episode-and-during-remission/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Therefore, the protocol was changed for a subsequent caplacizumab trial to continue caplacizumab for up to 28 days if ADAMTS13 activity had not recovered, and this practice resulted in a lower rate of exacerbations.</p><p>The normal value for ADAMTS13 activity is often described as &ge;60 percent. When measurement of ADAMTS13 activity is measured at the time of initial diagnosis, the threshold usually cited to support a clinical diagnosis of TTP is &lt;10 percent, but patients can have typical TTP with initial ADAMTS13 activity &ge;10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-management-following-recovery-from-an-acute-episode-and-during-remission/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3563199332\"><span class=\"h3\">Natural history of ADAMTS13 activity during remission</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following observational data provide a view of the natural history of ADAMTS13 activity during remission:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One of us (JNG) has followed patients with annual measurement of ADAMTS13 activity since 2004 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-management-following-recovery-from-an-acute-episode-and-during-remission/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. During this time (until 2017), patients were not treated during remission to prevent relapse. The most remarkable observation from this follow-up is that ADAMTS13 activity can vary from undetectable to normal without treatment, even in the same patient across time. Among 67 patients, 20 (30 percent) had ADAMTS13 activity &lt;10 percent on one or more annual assessments. Eight of these 20 patients had spontaneous recovery to normal ADAMTS13 activity (&gt;60 percent). Subsequent measurements remained normal in some of these patients and declined to &lt;10 percent in others. Eleven of the 20 (55 percent) have relapsed; the median time to relapse following the first observation of ADAMTS13 activity &lt;10 percent was 5.4 years. Only two of the 11 patients who relapsed following the observation of ADAMTS13 activity &lt;10 percent relapsed within one year. In 27 of the original 67 patients (40 percent), ADAMTS13 activity recovered to normal after recovery from their initial acute episode and remained normal. Only one of these patients has relapsed. Among the other 20 patients who never had an ADAMTS13 activity &lt;10 percent during remission but did not always have normal ADAMTS13 activity, the frequency of relapse was 25 percent. Therefore, ADAMTS13 deficiency during remission is associated with relapse, but the relapse is not necessarily imminent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-management-following-recovery-from-an-acute-episode-and-during-remission/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a French observational study of 233 patients who were followed for a year or more following an acute episode of acquired TTP, 48 (20 percent) had ADAMTS13 activity &lt;10 percent during remission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-management-following-recovery-from-an-acute-episode-and-during-remission/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Among these, 30 were treated with &quot;preemptive&quot; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> with the goal of preventing a subsequent relapse; 18 were not treated with rituximab due to different management practices at different institutions. Relapse-free survival may have been longer in the rituximab-treated patients (median relapse-free survival was 9.3 years in the untreated patients and was not reached in the treated patients; p = 0.049). ADAMTS13 levels increased from &lt;10 percent to a mean of 46 percent at three months after the initial preemptive rituximab infusion. Some patients who did not experience a durable increase in ADAMTS13 activity were then treated more aggressively (eg, with additional rituximab; with other immunosuppressive agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alemtuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alemtuzumab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bortezomib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bortezomib</a>; or with splenectomy). Importantly, two patients among the 18 who were not treated for ADAMTS13 activity &lt;10 percent died at the time of relapse. These data have important limitations. Patients who did not receive &quot;preemptive&quot; treatments were followed longer and therefore more relapses may have been observed. Further, the efficacy of a single conventional course of rituximab is unknown because some patients received multiple courses and others received multiple therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acquired-ttp-management-following-recovery-from-an-acute-episode-and-during-remission/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p>These data from two different registries of patients document that 20 to 30 percent of patients will have ADAMTS13 activity &lt;10 percent in remission and that these patients have greater risk for relapse than patients who do not have ADAMTS13 &lt;10 percent.

Thus, during the first week after stopping PEX, patients are monitored closely for symptoms and for recurrent thrombocytopenia, which indicates continuing activity of the TTP episode (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F116648\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116648 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4518755\" class=\"local\">'First week'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For individuals who have a normal (or increasing) platelet count following the first week after discontinuing PEX, we suggest tapering and discontinuing the glucocorticoids rapidly (over two to three weeks) rather than a slower taper (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> course is completed during the first month. (See <a href=\"#H4518761\" class=\"local\">'First month'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TTP relapses are generally identified more quickly than the initial episode because the patient and their clinician are familiar with the symptoms of TTP; it is rare to discover a relapse from a routine complete blood count (CBC) in an asymptomatic patient. An appropriate degree of attention to symptoms is needed on the part of the patient, family members, and any clinician involved in the patient's care. Any new symptoms suggestive of possible relapse require prompt (same-day) testing and review of the platelet count and immediate interventions for thrombocytopenia. For those who remain in remission, vaccinations are updated and patients are monitored for long-term complications of TTP. (See <a href=\"#H1803474\" class=\"local\">'First year'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4518790\" class=\"local\">'Routine medical care during remission'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The roles of ADAMTS13 activity monitoring and prophylactic administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> in asymptomatic patients in remission are evolving; our approaches are described in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F116648\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116648 \">table 1</a>) and above.

Thrombocytopenia strongly suggests disease relapse, and any patient with a platelet count <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;100,000/microL</span> requires immediate hospitalization, urgent additional diagnostic evaluation, and immediate initiation of PEX if the results of the evaluation are consistent with relapse (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F101761\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef101761 \">algorithm 1</a>).

Patients who have recovered from TTP require lifelong follow-up and assessment for these complications. (See <a href=\"#H4518790\" class=\"local\">'Routine medical care during remission'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most pregnancies following recovery from acquired TTP are successful, although the risks of preeclampsia and severe preeclampsia are increased. Women who become pregnant following recovery from acquired TTP must be followed closely, preferably by an obstetrician with experience in high-risk pregnancies. Women who experience a relapse of acquired TTP during pregnancy are treated similarly to individuals who are not pregnant, with urgent initiation of PEX and glucocorticoids. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Rituximab</a> is only used in women in their second and third trimesters if the patient does not respond appropriately to PEX and glucocorticoids. Delivery of the infant does not affect the course of the TTP, and delivery should only be performed for obstetric reasons.
