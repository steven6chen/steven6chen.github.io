Mesenteric venous thrombosis can present acutely or in a subacute or chronic manner. At one time, acute mesenteric venous thrombosis was thought to be the principal cause of acute mesenteric ischemia; however, with increasing recognition of and differentiation from the occlusive and nonocclusive forms of acute arterial mesenteric ischemia, the proportion of cases attributed to mesenteric venous thrombosis has decreased to approximately 10 percent of all cases of acute mesenteric ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesenteric-venous-thrombosis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Mesenteric venous thrombosis will be reviewed here. Acute and chronic mesenteric arterial occlusion affecting the small intestine, nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia, and colonic ischemia are discussed separately.

The anatomy of the intestinal circulation, normal physiology of the intestine, and response to ischemia are discussed in detail elsewhere.

Local factors (eg, splenectomy, pancreatitis) appear to be associated with initial thrombus formation in the large veins, whereas systemic hypercoagulable states (eg, protein C deficiency) lead to thrombosis initiated in the intramural venules, vasa recta, and venous arcades [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesenteric-venous-thrombosis-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Mesenteric vein thrombosis almost always involves the distal small intestine (superior mesenteric venous drainage) and rarely involves the colon (inferior mesenteric venous drainage) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesenteric-venous-thrombosis-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The anatomic site of involvement in acute mesenteric venous thrombosis is most often ileum (64 to 83 percent) or jejunum (50 to 81 percent), followed by colon (14 percent) and duodenum (4 to 8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesenteric-venous-thrombosis-in-adults/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. The inferior mesenteric venous distribution is less commonly involved for reasons that are poorly understood but possibly related to collateral flow through the internal iliac system, rectal venous plexus, or systemic circulation via the left renal vein, splenic vein, and hemiazygous veins, though this is unproven [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesenteric-venous-thrombosis-in-adults/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>].</p><p>Acute thrombotic occlusion of one or more mesenteric veins reduces perfusion pressure due to increased resistance in the mesenteric venous bed. As flow stagnates, increased venous pressure leads to efflux of fluid into the tissues, causing profound bowel wall edema, which can lead to submucosal hemorrhage. If the venous arcades and vasa recta are involved and venous return from the bowel wall is completely occluded, bowel infarction will occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesenteric-venous-thrombosis-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, not all cases of mesenteric venous thrombosis are associated with intestinal infarction. In animal models, gradual occlusion of the superior mesenteric vein is associated with the development of collateral venous drainage without ischemic damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesenteric-venous-thrombosis-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Chronic mesenteric venous thrombosis often features dilated venous collaterals, which can bleed, due to elevated venous pressures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesenteric-venous-thrombosis-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Many patients with chronic mesenteric venous thrombosis also exhibit portal vein thrombosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-portal-vein-thrombosis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic portal vein thrombosis in adults: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Sequestration of fluid into the bowel lumen combined with massive bowel wall edema results in relative hypovolemia and systemic hypotension. As a consequence, arterial flow is also reduced, which exacerbates ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesenteric-venous-thrombosis-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Arterial vasospasm is another factor thought to be important in the pathogenesis of ischemia and infarction associated with mesenteric venous thrombosis. Under experimental conditions, arterial spasm can occur in the presence of venous occlusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesenteric-venous-thrombosis-in-adults/abstract/10,13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,13-15</a>]. Arterial spasm can persist and may be of sufficient degree to cause intestinal infarction or secondary arterial thrombosis, even though the veins have returned to normal caliber after relief of temporary venous obstruction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H605133\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a time cohort study from Sweden, the incidence of mesenteric venous thrombosis increased from 2.0 per 100,000 patient-years between 1970 and 1982 to 2.7 per 100,000 patient-years between 2000 and 2006, which was attributed to increased diagnosis using computed tomography, which was more prevalent in the latter cohort, compared with a surgery or autopsy diagnosis in the earlier cohort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesenteric-venous-thrombosis-in-adults/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p>The proportion of cases of <strong>acute</strong> mesenteric ischemia attributed to mesenteric venous thrombosis has varied widely in the literature but has decreased over time, likely related to better differentiation from acute arterial occlusion and nonocclusive mesenteric ischemia. In a systematic review of cases from 1966 to 2002 that included 3692 patients, mesenteric venous thrombosis was responsible for 3 percent of cases of acute mesenteric thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesenteric-venous-thrombosis-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In other reviews, acute mesenteric venous thrombosis accounts for between 2 and 10 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesenteric-venous-thrombosis-in-adults/abstract/4,5,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,19</a>].</p><p>Estimates of the incidence of <strong>chronic</strong> mesenteric venous thrombosis are reported less frequently than those of acute mesenteric venous thrombosis, most likely because a large proportion of these patients do not complain of abdominal pain. In two reviews that included patients with either acute or chronic mesenteric venous thrombosis, chronic mesenteric venous thrombosis accounted for 24 to 40 percent of the total number of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesenteric-venous-thrombosis-in-adults/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H605139\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mesenteric venous thrombosis is a multifactorial disorder predisposed by certain risk factors, which can be broadly divided into acquired and inherited conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesenteric-venous-thrombosis-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Local intra-abdominal inflammatory processes (eg, pancreatitis, inflammatory bowel disease) or trauma (eg, splenectomy) increase the risk for acquired mesenteric venous thrombosis and tend to affect the larger veins. Mesenteric venous thrombosis has been reported as a postoperative complication of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy for obesity. In two retrospective surveys of more than 2900 patients, the incidence of this complication was approximately 0.7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesenteric-venous-thrombosis-in-adults/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heritable and acquired thrombophilias (eg, prothrombin G20210A mutation, MPD) and hypercoagulable states related to systemic disorders (eg, nephrotic syndrome, malignancy) are more likely to affect the smaller veins.

A previous history of deep vein thrombosis is reported in approximately 20 to 40 percent of patients with mesenteric venous thrombosis. It is unknown whether the superior mesenteric vein thrombosis has any unique associations with a specific heritable thrombophilia, compared with portal or splenic vein thrombosis, or if acute mesenteric venous thrombosis has risk factors separate and distinct from subacute or chronic mesenteric venous thrombosis. Patients without identifiable risk factors are regarded as having idiopathic mesenteric venous thrombosis. The frequency of idiopathic cases in various series ranges from 21 to 49 percent. However, on closer examination, up to one-third of these patients have identifiable risk factors and, in modern series, laboratory evidence of a coexistent heritable thrombophilia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesenteric-venous-thrombosis-in-adults/abstract/28,51-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,51-53</a>].</p><p>Malignancy is reported in 4 to 16 percent of patients with acute mesenteric venous thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesenteric-venous-thrombosis-in-adults/abstract/4,5,9,19,20,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,9,19,20,36</a>]. No studies have examined differences in the incidence of mesenteric venous thrombosis for the various types of malignancy (eg, solid intra-abdominal, solid extra-abdominal, blood malignancy). Myeloproliferative disorders, which are associated with an increased risk for arterial or venous thrombosis, are identified in 8 to 18 percent of patients with acute or chronic mesenteric venous thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesenteric-venous-thrombosis-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

Mesenteric venous thrombosis can present acutely, subacutely (which may be related to a delay in seeking medical attention or to delayed diagnosis), or more chronically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesenteric-venous-thrombosis-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. There appears to be considerable overlap between the various forms. Patients whose disease process starts in the small veins and in whom the most peripheral venous drainage is affected from the outset appear to be at greatest risk of intestinal infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesenteric-venous-thrombosis-in-adults/abstract/6,20,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,20,54</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H420370637\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p>The average age at presentation of mesenteric venous thrombosis in various reports is between 45 and 60 years, with a slight male to female predominance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesenteric-venous-thrombosis-in-adults/abstract/4,5,11,16,19,20,36,55-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,11,16,19,20,36,55-57</a>]. The age at presentation varies with underlying etiology.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H420369317\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute mesenteric venous thrombosis, like other forms of acute mesenteric ischemia, is suggested by the onset of colicky, periumbilical abdominal pain, present for at least a few hours and out of proportion to the abdominal findings on physical examination, at least initially [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesenteric-venous-thrombosis-in-adults/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. However, the onset is often less sudden than other forms of mesenteric ischemia, and the pain is usually more dull. Over 75 percent of patients report at least two days of pain before seeking medical attention; the duration of symptoms ranges from 5 to 14 days. Although patients with objective signs of acute mesenteric venous thrombosis occasionally report pain that has persisted for more than a month, some authors suggest the definition of acute mesenteric venous thrombosis should be limited to symptom duration less than four weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesenteric-venous-thrombosis-in-adults/abstract/4,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,55</a>]. Approximately one-half of patients have nausea and vomiting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesenteric-venous-thrombosis-in-adults/abstract/4,5,16,19,20,36,55-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,16,19,20,36,55-57</a>].</p><p>The abdominal examination may reveal abdominal distension, and occult blood may be found in the stool. Signs of peritoneal inflammation, such as rebound tenderness and guarding, are typically absent. However, if bowel distention progresses, the bowel can become ischemic. Bowel sounds will become absent, and peritoneal signs will develop. The incidence of peritonitis reported is variable, but complications leading to peritonitis are uncommon in those who are appropriately anticoagulated. (See <a href=\"#H539889998\" class=\"local\">'Anticoagulation'</a> below and <a href=\"#H603147\" class=\"local\">'Abdominal exploration'</a> below.)</p><p>Plain abdominal radiographs are relatively nonspecific and may be completely normal in more than 25 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesenteric-venous-thrombosis-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Findings suggestive of acute mesenteric ischemia include the presence of an ileus with distended loops of bowel and bowel wall thickening, the latter of which is particularly prominent in patients with acute mesenteric venous thrombosis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pneumatosis intestinalis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F74055\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef74055 \">image 1</a>).

Nonspecific abdominal pain may be the only feature.</p><p>Whether this presentation represents a distinct group or a subset of acute mesenteric venous thrombosis related to delays in seeking medical attention or delay in diagnosis is not entirely clear.</p><p>The subacute form of mesenteric venous thrombosis occurs in the circumstance of venous occlusion sufficient to produce ischemia but adequate compensation through collateral vessels to allow recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesenteric-venous-thrombosis-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Nevertheless, some patients with subacute mesenteric venous thrombosis can progress to acute intestinal infarction requiring surgical intervention. Others may develop chronic symptoms.

In one study of 121 patients, a similar number of patients presented with asymptomatic chronic mesenteric venous thrombosis as those who presented acutely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesenteric-venous-thrombosis-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Symptomatic patients with chronic mesenteric venous thrombosis typically present with complications of portal hypertension (variceal bleeding or ascites), in most cases related to concomitant portal or splenic vein thrombosis. A minority of patients have intermittent abdominal pain after eating due to increased demand for splanchnic blood flow or related to acute thrombus superimposed on chronic thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesenteric-venous-thrombosis-in-adults/abstract/21,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,50</a>].</p><p>Some patients with chronic presentation have portal hypertension-related bleeding.

A careful review of the patient's personal and family history may increase suspicion for venous thrombosis in a patient with a clinical presentation that suggests intestinal ischemia. A personal or family history of a deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism is present in approximately one-half of patients with acute mesenteric venous thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesenteric-venous-thrombosis-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H605139\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p>Nevertheless, a definitive diagnosis of mesenteric venous thrombosis relies upon the demonstration of thrombosis within the mesenteric veins on imaging studies, which is discussed below. The diagnosis will necessarily be made in the operating room in patients who present with signs of bowel infarction.

Mesenteric venous thrombosis is most reliably demonstrated using magnetic resonance (MR) venography, although we recommend computed tomography (CT) with and without oral and intravenous contrast as an initial screening study because of its widespread availability. For patients with a nondiagnostic CT for whom a clinical suspicion for mesenteric venous thrombosis persists (ie, no alternative explanation for symptoms and a known hypercoagulable risk factor or family history of venous thrombosis), we suggest angiography (CT angiography with delayed imaging to capture venous phase, MR angiography, or standard catheter based).</p><p>MR angiography is an excellent imaging study for the diagnosis of mesenteric venous thrombosis, but motion artifacts may limit its accuracy. Some studies report 100 percent sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of acute or chronic mesenteric venous thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesenteric-venous-thrombosis-in-adults/abstract/59-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">59-61</a>]. However, CT angiography of the abdomen is reasonably sensitive and specific for mesenteric venous thrombosis, provided there is adequate portal venous phase contrast, and is preferred over MR because of its lower costs and wide availability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesenteric-venous-thrombosis-in-adults/abstract/62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63</a>]. In addition, as an initial study, CT more reliably demonstrates findings of focal or segmental bowel wall ischemia, in addition to ruling out other causes of acute abdominal pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesenteric-venous-thrombosis-in-adults/abstract/64-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">64-67</a>].

Isolated mesenteric vein thrombosis may be more difficult to appreciate. In one study, abdominal CT was less frequently diagnostic for patients without compared with those with concomitant portal or splenic vein involvement (67 versus 97 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesenteric-venous-thrombosis-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>On CT, the diagnosis of mesenteric venous thrombosis is made by the presence of venous filling defects or absent flow in the mesenteric veins during the venous phase.

In addition to more accurately distinguishing arterial from venous forms of acute mesenteric ischemia, catheter-based arteriography provides access for thrombolytic and other interventional therapies. Findings on angiography consistent with acute mesenteric venous thrombosis include late filling of the superior mesenteric vein, thrombus in the superior mesenteric vein with partial or complete obstruction, failure of arterial arcades to empty normally, reflux of contrast into the arterial system (aorta), arterial spasm, and a prolonged vascular blush [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesenteric-venous-thrombosis-in-adults/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].</p><p>Chronic mesenteric venous thrombosis is suggested by the presence of thrombus with well-developed collateralization, often in association with cavernous transformation of the portal vein (collateral development within or around the thrombosed portal vein) and in the absence of signs of intestinal ischemia or infarction.

Thus, we monitor the patient with serial abdominal examination and laboratory studies for signs of clinical worsening that may manifest as peritonitis related to transmural ischemia, infarction or perforation, or development of small bowel obstruction. Abdominal imaging studies are repeated as the clinical situation dictates. We also monitor for the development of abdominal compartment syndrome. The absence of any of these issues and gradual clinical improvement allow initiation of a diet.</p><p>We monitor laboratory studies daily (or more frequently when needed), including complete blood count (CBC), white blood cell (WBC) count with differential, serum electrolytes including bicarbonate, and serum lactate levels for signs of bowel ischemia, metabolic acidosis, or sepsis. Follow-up abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan in 24 to 48 hours is reasonable to exclude signs of transmural necrosis. Most of the literature on the subject considers surgical exploration to be indicated if there are signs of peritoneal irritation at presentation. However, with acute mesenteric venous thrombosis, peritoneal signs may not strictly correlate and may underestimate the severity of bowel ischemia. Some authors have suggested that bowel wall thickness and bowel wall enhancement on the arterial phase of CT should be evaluated as criteria to determine whether or not to proceed with abdominal exploration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mesenteric-venous-thrombosis-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Transarterial thrombolysis may be an alternative approach for selected mesenteric beds. In specialized centers, transcatheter thrombolysis may be a reasonable therapeutic adjuvant for well-selected patients with severe disease, for whom an inadequate response to anticoagulation is observed, but without signs of bowel necrosis. However, additional studies are needed to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of thrombolysis compared with anticoagulation.

Overall, the incidence of short bowel syndrome and the 30-day mortality rates were also lower (7 versus 41 percent), and one-year survival was improved (93 versus 53 percent).

The proportion of cases of acute mesenteric ischemia attributed to mesenteric venous thrombosis has decreased over time, likely related to better differentiation of mesenteric venous thrombosis from the occlusive and nonocclusive forms of acute arterial mesenteric ischemia. (See <a href=\"#H597100\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute thrombotic occlusion of one or more mesenteric veins (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F88949\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef88949 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F81960\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81960 \">figure 2</a>) reduces perfusion pressure due to increased resistance in the mesenteric venous bed. Mesenteric vein thrombosis almost always involves the distal small intestine (superior mesenteric venous drainage) and rarely involves the colon (inferior mesenteric venous drainage), possibly related to difference in collateral flow. Increased venous pressure leads to efflux of fluid into the tissues, causing profound bowel wall edema, which combined with sequestration of fluid into the bowel lumen results in relative hypovolemia, and systemic hypotension. (See <a href=\"#H597106\" class=\"local\">'Mesenteric venous anatomy and pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mesenteric venous thrombosis is a multifactorial disorder predisposed by certain risk factors, which can be broadly divided into acquired (eg, pancreatitis, malignancy) and inherited conditions (eg, prothrombin G20210A mutation). Risk factors are listed above. At least one predisposing risk factor is recognized in most patients who present with mesenteric venous thrombosis. (See <a href=\"#H605133\" class=\"local\">'Incidence and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical features of mesenteric venous thrombosis are determined by the location and timing of thrombus formation within the splanchnic vasculature. Mesenteric venous thrombosis can present acutely, subacutely, or more chronically. Patients with acute or subacute mesenteric venous thrombosis have variable degrees of abdominal pain with or without peritoneal signs related to ischemic complications. Patients with chronic mesenteric venous thrombosis can be asymptomatic or symptomatic and typically present with complications of portal hypertension (variceal bleeding or ascites), related in most cases to concomitant portal or splenic vein thrombosis. (See <a href=\"#H600891\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A high index of suspicion based upon history and clinical findings is necessary to make an early diagnosis. Definitive diagnosis of mesenteric venous thrombosis relies upon the demonstration of thrombus within the mesenteric veins on imaging studies. Although magnetic resonance (MR) venography is overall the most accurate imaging study for the diagnosis of mesenteric venous thrombosis, we suggest computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen as an initial screening study for acute or subacute mesenteric venous thrombosis. Abdominal CT more reliably demonstrates findings of focal or segmental bowel wall ischemia, in addition to excluding other causes of acute abdominal pain, and is inexpensive and widely available. For patients in whom the diagnosis of acute mesenteric ischemia is uncertain but a suspicion remains high, angiography (CT angiography, MR angiography, or catheter based) should be performed, though it is uncommonly necessary. The diagnosis will necessarily be made in the operating room in patients who present with signs of bowel infarction. (See <a href=\"#H600897\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H603147\" class=\"local\">'Abdominal exploration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with clinical signs of bowel infarction require surgical intervention. We use an open approach rather than laparoscopic exploration. The extent of bowel edema and resulting abdominal distention make a laparoscopic approach difficult, and insufflation of the abdomen can exacerbate mesenteric venous hypertension. We have a low threshold for leaving the abdomen open to facilitate second-look operation. Whenever the viability of the intestine is in question, a second-look operation should be planned and performed as scheduled. (See <a href=\"#H603147\" class=\"local\">'Abdominal exploration'</a> above and <a href=\"#H420382034\" class=\"local\">'Second-look operation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with <strong>acute</strong> or <strong>subacute</strong> mesenteric venous thrombosis without indications for surgery, we initiate systemic anticoagulation to minimize extension of thrombus, rather than expectant management alone (includes bowel rest and decompression, fluid therapy, and serial abdominal examination). An adjunct to anticoagulation may include thrombolytic therapy or other endovascular treatment. We also initiate prophylactic antibiotics to minimize bacterial translocation. (See <a href=\"#H539890766\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"#H539889998\" class=\"local\">'Anticoagulation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H420377283\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacologic thrombolysis/mechanical thrombectomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with <strong>chronic</strong> mesenteric venous thrombosis, anticoagulation is individualized and depends upon symptoms, location and extent of thrombosis, and risk for bleeding. (See <a href=\"#H539889998\" class=\"local\">'Anticoagulation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Our recommendations for duration of therapy are as follows (see <a href=\"#H539889998\" class=\"local\">'Anticoagulation'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with no identifiable risk factors, or transient or correctable acquired risk factors (eg, pancreatitis), we anticoagulate for six months of anticoagulation, rather than long-term anticoagulation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with risk factors that cannot be corrected (malignancy, inherited condition), we anticoagulate long term, rather than six months of anticoagulation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We serially monitor the patient for signs of clinical worsening (physical examination, laboratory testing, repeat imaging). The absence of any of these issues and serial clinical improvement in symptoms allow initiation of a diet. (See <a href=\"#H420377136\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring progress'</a> above and <a href=\"#H539889901\" class=\"local\">'Postoperative care and follow-up'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients diagnosed with mesenteric venous thrombosis who have no known predisposing risk factors, we suggest hypercoagulable testing to help determine the duration of anticoagulation, predict associated complications of the underlying illness, and educate family members. Patients with acute isolated superior mesenteric venous thrombosis may be more likely to harbor an underlying systemic hypercoagulable state, compared with patients who have thrombosis of the portal or splenic veins in addition to the superior mesenteric vein. (See <a href=\"#H539889933\" class=\"local\">'Identifying associated hypercoagulability'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-inherited-thrombophilia-in-asymptomatic-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for inherited thrombophilia in asymptomatic adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute mesenteric venous thrombosis has a better prognosis than acute arterial mesenteric ischemia. Morbidity and mortality related to mesenteric venous thrombosis have improved due to better recognition and early treatment. With prompt diagnosis and anticoagulation, mortality rates for acute mesenteric venous thrombosis in modern studies are between 10 and 20 percent, but mortality rates remain as high as 75 percent for those with intestinal infarction. The prognosis for patients with chronic mesenteric venous thrombosis is related to the severity of the underlying illness (eg, malignancy).
