To diagnose female orgasmic disorder, the symptoms must cause marked distress or interpersonal difficulty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-female-orgasmic-disorder/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>Treatment for female orgasmic disorder consists principally of education and psychosocial interventions; clinical trials of their efficacy are limited.</p><p>This topic discusses the treatment of female orgasmic disorder. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis of female orgasmic disorder are discussed separately. The assessment of patients with sexual dysfunction is also discussed separately. The epidemiology, risk factors, evaluation, and an overview of treatment of women with sexual dysfunction are also discussed separately. The prevalence and management of sexual dysfunction due to serotonergic antidepressants is also discussed separately.

As examples, this category would include women who were once orgasmic but not any longer (generalized) as well as women who are orgasmic through masturbation but not partnered sexual activity (situational). </p><p>Other terms used synonymously include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&ldquo;Situational orgasmic disorder&rdquo;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&ldquo;Acquired orgasmic disorder&rdquo;</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H578730963\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>General principles in the management of female orgasmic disorder include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Establishing a collaborative relationship with the patient. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gathering an adequate psychosexual history to establish probable causal or contributing factors. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Setting clear, feasible treatment goals.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ensuring that the patient&rsquo;s mood and psychosocial functioning are stable. Although the patient may prioritize concerns with sexual functioning, problems such as serious mood disturbance, psychotic symptoms, suicidality, and pervasive relational conflict should be treated prior to focusing clinical attention on female orgasmic disorder. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The nature of most treatments necessitate that patients complete assigned readings, exercises, or activities between clinician visits. Adherence to treatment recommendations, in our experience, contributes to positive outcomes. Clinicians should help patients maintain motivation and resolve barriers to adherence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-female-orgasmic-disorder/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H578730970\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT EDUCATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patient education should precede and support a discussion of treatment options. Women typically welcome accurate, detailed information about anatomy and sexual function. The process of educating the patient will at times reveal assumptions or misconceptions that may be contributing to a problem. Receipt of corrective information is often therapeutic. Further assessment of contributing factors (eg, relationship problems, negative beliefs about sexuality) can often be conducted during education. The patient should understand the rationale for the proposed treatment and the necessity of her taking an active role in treatment. Motivated, high functioning patients may benefit from an accurate self-help book with little or no additional intervention by the clinician [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-female-orgasmic-disorder/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. An excellent resource is the self-help manual &ldquo;Becoming Orgasmic&rdquo;<em> </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-female-orgasmic-disorder/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]<em>.</em> </p><p>The clinician should have a frank discussion with the patient about the adequacy of stimulation that she receives. Women and their partners may benefit from information about sexual positions and techniques to enhance the woman&rsquo;s sexual stimulation. If the woman engages in vaginal intercourse with a male partner, use of the coital alignment technique has been shown to facilitate orgasm and satisfaction with sexual activity. The coital alignment technique is a variant of the missionary position in which the male partner positions himself higher in relation to the female&rsquo;s body and uses a downward (rather than horizontal) thrusting motion, allowing the base and dorsal side of the penis to come into closer contact with the clitoris. This allows for greater clitoral stimulation and, hypothetically, a greater likelihood of orgasm stimulated through vaginal intercourse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-female-orgasmic-disorder/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. </p><p>Attainment of orgasm through vaginal intercourse may not be an achievable goal in some patients. Clinicians should discuss manual and oral stimulation as normal, legitimate means of attaining orgasm during partnered sexual activity.</p><p>Some women will benefit substantially from a single encounter that involves validation, education, and an opportunity to ask questions. However, in our experience, many women present for treatment after multiple failed attempts to remedy the problem on their own and require further treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H578730977\"><span class=\"h1\">PSYCHOSOCIAL INTERVENTION STRATEGIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies of psychosocial interventions, also referred to as &ldquo;sex therapy techniques,&rdquo; make up the vast majority of the empirical literature on treatments for female orgasmic disorder. Most of the interventions that have been examined empirically are grounded in behavior therapy principles, with considerable overlap among the approaches. They share an emphasis on exposure to novel experiences and information, learning new skills, and generalization of these skills to a range of sexual activities. In clinical practice, these interventions are frequently combined or coupled with other treatments (eg, marital therapy) for women with more complex presentations, or if monotherapy is not successful. </p><p>Clinical trials of these interventions are limited, with small sample sizes and few head-to-head comparisons. In our experience, women with primary female orgasmic disorder can often be effectively treated with psychosocial interventions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-female-orgasmic-disorder/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Women with acquired or situational female orgasmic disorder are less likely to benefit from sex therapy, especially in the long term. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=female-orgasmic-disorder-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis#H12710909\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Female orgasmic disorder: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sexual-dysfunction-in-women-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-evaluation#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sexual dysfunction in women: Epidemiology, risk factors, and evaluation&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>Psychosocial interventions are described below, followed by data on their efficacy. Where available, data from trials in primary female orgasmic disorder are described first, followed by data in secondary female orgasmic disorder, and then by data in samples including both disorders. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H578730984\"><span class=\"h2\">Directed masturbation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Directed masturbation (sometimes referred to as masturbation training) is a program of education and self-awareness exercises aimed at teaching a woman to reach orgasm through self-stimulation and, eventually, through partnered sexual activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-female-orgasmic-disorder/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. After the rationale has been explained and the woman is educated about basic sexual anatomy and physiology, she is instructed to explore her body visually and through touch in a series of exercises at home. </p><p>The initial goal is simply to become familiar with one&rsquo;s own body, particularly the genitals. In later steps the focus is to identify areas that are pleasurable to touch, and then to stimulate those areas directly. Erotic videos, pictures, or text, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a vibrator can be used to enhance this experience. Once a woman is able to reach orgasm reliably, the partner (if applicable) is brought into the home &ldquo;practice&rdquo; sessions so that he or she can learn to stimulate the woman to orgasm during sexual activity.</p><p>Clinicians teach directed masturbation in individual, group, and couples formats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-female-orgasmic-disorder/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. The techniques can be learned in a self-help format, eg, with the manual &ldquo;Becoming Orgasmic&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-female-orgasmic-disorder/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], although the efficacy of a self-help approach (without clinician assistance) has not been evaluated. </p><p>Based on our clinical experience, weekly sessions on directed masturbation over a period of five to six weeks are likely to be acceptable and efficacious for most patients, even though clinical trials often studied twice weekly sessions over this period, or weekly sessions over a longer duration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-female-orgasmic-disorder/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Highly motivated patients may be able to benefit with less frequent contact (eg, semi-monthly sessions), particularly after the first several weeks of treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H121973880\"><span class=\"h3\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Three small randomized trials found that directed masturbation led to better outcomes than other interventions or control conditions in women with primary female orgasmic disorder. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A randomized trial compared a 12-session directed masturbation intervention with a 12-session treatment that included psychoeducation and sensate focus exercises in 37 women with primary female orgasmic disorder and their male partners [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-female-orgasmic-disorder/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. At the end of treatment, more women in the directed masturbation group were able to experience orgasm compared with the <span class=\"nowrap\">education/sensate</span> focus group (90 versus 53 percent). At one year, the women in the directed masturbation group maintained treatment gains.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sixty women with primary female orgasmic disorder were randomly assigned to one of two self-administered directed masturbation treatments or a waitlist control condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-female-orgasmic-disorder/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Treatment groups were split between those who received instructions in writing or in a series of videotapes. Participants in both directed masturbation groups were provided a vibrator. Many more of the 40 women assigned to one of the directed masturbation groups experienced orgasm by the end of treatment compared with the women in the control group (60 versus 0 percent). There were no significant differences in outcomes between written and video treatment groups.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thirty women with primary female orgasmic disorder accompanied by sexual anxiety or aversion were randomly assigned to receive directed masturbation, systematic desensitization, or to the waiting list control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-female-orgasmic-disorder/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Sexual arousal and orgasm increased among women in the directed masturbation and waiting list groups compared with the group receiving systematic desensitization. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a mixed sample consisting of 11 women, three with primary female orgasmic disorder and eight with secondary (acquired or situational) female orgasmic disorder, a seven-week, randomized trial compared a directed masturbation program with a waitlist control supplemented by written educational information [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-female-orgasmic-disorder/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Women in the directed masturbation group experienced more frequent coital orgasms at the end of treatment than the control group; their gains were enhanced six weeks posttreatment.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9817026\"><span class=\"h2\">Sensate focus exercises</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sensate focus is a couples-oriented treatment that consists of clinician visits for education and treatment planning, and a series of home exercises to increase the partners&rsquo; comfort with sexual intimacy and reduce avoidance of feared experiences. One goal of sensate focus is to orient the partners&rsquo; goals for sex toward attaining sensual pleasure rather than orgasm per se [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-female-orgasmic-disorder/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p>Sensate focus exercises usually begin by having partners exchange pleasurable touch of areas of the body other than the genitals and breasts, perhaps even while clothed. Subsequent sessions gradually allow for greater touching of breasts, buttocks, and eventually genitals, although intercourse is not recommended until the final stages of treatment. </p><p>The therapist typically helps the couple enhance verbal and nonverbal sexual communication skills so that the partners can be enabled to give guidance and feedback to one another regarding their preferences for touch. Barriers to regular, open sexual expression (eg, repeatedly &ldquo;forgetting&rdquo; to complete exercises, negative feelings arising during exercises) are also commonly addressed in treatment. </p><p>Sensate focus training is typically provided in 10 to 16 sessions, occurring weekly or biweekly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H136202569\"><span class=\"h3\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A single, small randomized trial found sensate focus exercises less effective than directed masturbation in primary female orgasmic disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-female-orgasmic-disorder/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The trial compared a 12-session treatment that included psychoeducation and sensate focus exercises with a directed masturbation intervention in 37 women and their male partners. A smaller proportion of women in the <span class=\"nowrap\">education/sensate</span> focus group compared with the directed masturbation group were able to experience orgasm at the end of the trial (53 versus 90 percent). </p><p>Two small trials of a sensate focus intervention in women with secondary orgasmic disorder found mixed evidence for improving orgasmic function. Improvement was seen in secondary outcomes, including relationship satisfaction and enjoyment of noncoital sexual activity.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A trial randomly assigned 48 women with secondary orgasmic disorder and their partners to either a waitlist control condition or to one of three 12-session treatments: sensate focus, systematic desensitization, or combined systematic desensitization and sensate focus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-female-orgasmic-disorder/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Outcomes were reported in terms of a score on a measure of &ldquo;sexual motivation&rdquo;; data on orgasmic frequency before and after treatment were not provided. Outcomes for the two monotherapy groups were comparable and superior compared with the control condition, in which no improvement was observed. Combined treatment was found to be inferior to monotherapy. Gains in the sensate focus group were not maintained at six months follow-up.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a 14-week uncontrolled trial of sensate focus exercises in 23 women with secondary female orgasmic dysfunction and their spouses, no improvement was seen in orgasmic functioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-female-orgasmic-disorder/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Subjects reported increased enjoyment of noncoital sexual activity.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14777000\"><span class=\"h2\">Cognitive-behavioral sex therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cognitive-behavioral sex therapy combines behavioral techniques such as directed masturbation and sensate focus with cognitive techniques with which the clinician helps the patient to identify and challenge distorted beliefs and assumptions that may interfere with sexual pleasure. (See <a href=\"#H578730984\" class=\"local\">'Directed masturbation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9817026\" class=\"local\">'Sensate focus exercises'</a> above.)</p><p>Examples of beliefs and assumptions that are addressed include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fear of experiencing orgasm in front of a partner (eg, difficulty in acting spontaneously out of concern for losing control or having her behavior perceived negatively during orgasm). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unrealistic expectations for sexual performance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excessive concern about appearance and attractiveness during sexual activity.</p><p/><p>Therapeutic activities may include cognitive restructuring (systematically identifying and correcting logical errors that maintain dysfunctional beliefs) and behavioral experiments in which the patient &ldquo;tests&rdquo; her beliefs, usually in the context of real-life situations. As an example, a woman who is accustomed to using fantasy during masturbation may find herself avoiding fantasy during sexual activity with a new partner due to the belief that it will lead her to desire her partner less. Once given &ldquo;permission&rdquo; to engage in fantasy to reach orgasm during sex, she may find that she more often looks forward to lovemaking and may even experience orgasm without the use of fantasy in the future. </p><p>Cognitive-behavioral sex therapy also generally incorporates specific skills such as mindfulness training and partner communication training, which may help in modifying thoughts and behaviors that might contribute to the problem.</p><p>Cognitive-behavioral sex therapy is typically provided to women or couples in 10 to 15 weekly or biweekly sessions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H136202406\"><span class=\"h3\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cognitive-behavioral sex therapy has not been studied in randomized trials in women with female orgasmic disorder. Three small uncontrolled trials in couples with mixed sexual dysfunction found improvement in orgasmic functioning following treatment. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Twelve women with primary anorgasmia and their partners, taking part in a larger trial, received a 20-session intervention employing CBT strategies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-female-orgasmic-disorder/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Treatment focused on education, anxiety reduction, communication and assertiveness training, correction of maladaptive beliefs, and, in some cases, masturbation training. In the period following treatment, 22 percent were able to have an orgasm in at least 50 percent of partnered sexual encounters. No subjects met this criterion in a follow-up assessment several months later.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thirty-five women with primary or secondary orgasmic disorder and their spouses, taking part in a larger trial of persons with mixed sexual disorders, were treated with cognitive-behavioral sex therapy techniques weekly for 15 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-female-orgasmic-disorder/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Women with primary orgasmic disorder reported increased frequency of orgasm with masturbation post-treatment (from 0 to 25 percent of the time) and more so at three months follow-up (50 percent of the time); however, these gains did not apply to orgasm with other forms of stimulation. Women with secondary orgasmic disorder reported increased frequency of orgasm during four of five sexual activities assessed, including masturbation and noncoital sexual activity. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an uncontrolled trial, 54 women with mixed sexual dysfunctions were treated with cognitive-behavioral sex therapy. The proportion of women in the sample with anorgasmia decreased from pre- to posttreatment (67 versus 11 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-female-orgasmic-disorder/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14777046\"><span class=\"h2\">Systematic desensitization and exposure therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of patients with orgasmic dysfunction accompanied by anxiety associated with partnered sexual activity aims to increase the patient&rsquo;s comfort with these activities and reduce avoidance of feared experiences. </p><p>Systematic desensitization is an anxiety reduction technique that is based on the principles of conditioning. An anxiety provoking stimulus (which may be real or imagined) is paired with a relaxation response until the stimulus no longer evokes anxiety. As treatment progresses, the woman is assisted to extinguish her anxiety response to increasingly challenging scenarios that are relevant to her sexual life. The patient is first asked to construct a list of progressively anxiety provoking scenarios that are personally relevant (eg, having breasts touched while clothed, being seen in the nude, receiving manual clitoral stimulation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-female-orgasmic-disorder/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. She is then taught relaxation techniques such as diaphragmatic breathing and progressive muscle relaxation that are conducted while experiencing these scenarios, usually through imaginal or verbal exposure. </p><p>Starting with the least challenging scenario, the patient imagines or verbally describes the scenario and applies relaxation skills when she notices anxiety. This process is repeated until the scenario no longer provokes an anxious response, at which point the patient progresses to the next most anxiety provoking item on the hierarchy. Related anxiety reduction techniques that may be used similarly include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In vivo desensitization, which closely resembles sensate focus exercises but with more explicit attention to anxiety.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Imaginal exposure without the use of relaxation techniques, in which case habituation and cognitive processing are the presumed mediators of anxiety reduction. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H343899501\"><span class=\"h3\">Exposure therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In practice, systematic desensitization is seldom used as a first-line intervention for anxiety, having been replaced over time by more effective and efficient exposure-based treatments. Exposure therapies preserve some elements of systematic desensitization (chiefly, constructing and working through a hierarchy of anxiety-provoking scenarios) but do not rely on the use of relaxation techniques and generally involve greater attention to cognitive factors. Anxiety reduction techniques are usually incorporated with other interventions for treatment of female orgasmic disorder and are generally limited to situations in which sexual anxiety is believed to contribute substantially to the problem. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H136202700\"><span class=\"h3\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two small randomized trials of systematic desensitization in women with primary or secondary female orgasmic disorder found positive results, but one did not report the intervention&rsquo;s effect on orgasmic functioning.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thirty women with primary female orgasmic disorder accompanied by sexual anxiety or aversion were randomly assigned to receive systematic desensitization, directed masturbation, or to the waiting list control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-female-orgasmic-disorder/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

Outcomes were reported in terms of a score on a measure of &ldquo;sexual motivation&rdquo;; data on orgasmic frequency before and after treatment were not provided.

As an example, a trial of 26 women with female orgasmic disorder compared an integrative treatment that included behavioral, psychoanalytic, and hypnosis components, delivered three times per week for 42 weeks, to a 16-week behavioral intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-female-orgasmic-disorder/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], with a control condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-female-orgasmic-disorder/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Immediately following their respective treatments, a greater proportion of women receiving the integrative intervention achieved the desired outcome criterion of achieving orgasm during at least 60 percent of occasions of foreplay or intercourse compared with women in the behavioral group or the control group (88 versus 25 versus percent). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H578731040\"><span class=\"h2\">Administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Administration of psychosocial interventions for female orgasmic disorder requires specialized training beyond that generally received by most types of mental health clinicians.

Larger randomized trials and head-to-head comparisons of interventions are needed to guide choices among treatments.</p><p>Patient education should be provided to women with female orgasmic disorder, preceding and supporting a discussion about treatment options.

Treatment of the couple with cognitive-behavioral sex therapy can be helpful in cases that do not respond adequately to education alone. The clinician should provide education to both partners and pay careful attention to potential interpersonal conflicts that might maintain the problem or reduce motivation to resolve it.
