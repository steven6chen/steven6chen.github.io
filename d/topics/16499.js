Since the 1990s, however, new studies in pathology and epidemiology have provided the basis for an important evolution in the understanding of SIDS.</p><p>The risk factors for and measures to reduce the risk of SIDS are discussed in this topic review. Clinical management for the family of an infant who has succumbed to SIDS and alternate diagnostic considerations are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sudden-unexpected-infant-death-including-sids-initial-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sudden unexpected infant death including SIDS: Initial management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6270404\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SIDS is defined as the sudden death of an infant younger than one year of age, which remains unexplained after a thorough case investigation, including performance of a complete autopsy, examination of the death scene, and review of the clinical history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. </p><p>This definition emphasizes the necessity of autopsy, death scene investigation, and review of the clinical history when making the diagnosis of SIDS, to exclude other explanations for the sudden unexpected infant death that can mimic SIDS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F79550\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79550 \">table 1</a>). The evaluation of an infant who has died of suspected SIDS and alternate diagnostic considerations are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sudden-unexpected-infant-death-including-sids-initial-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sudden unexpected infant death including SIDS: Initial management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1384069776\"><span class=\"h1\">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Due in part to potential inconsistencies in the diagnosis of SIDS, the term &quot;sudden unexpected infant death&quot; (SUID) is often used to describe all unexpected infant deaths. The SUID designation can then be subdivided into explained SUID and unexplained SUID. Unexplained SUID generally includes those cases considered SIDS by the medical examiner, as well as some cases that are not considered SIDS but lack a clear explanation due to uncertain circumstances. Some reports in the literature use the term &quot;unexplained SUID&quot; instead of &quot;SIDS&quot; to avoid inconsistencies between medical examiners in reporting SIDS as a cause of death.</p><p>SIDS has similar risk factors to other sleep-related infant deaths, including those attributed to suffocation, asphyxia, and entrapment. Therefore, these are now addressed together in recommendations for a safe infant sleeping environment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This topic review will use the term &quot;SIDS,&quot; but much of the discussion about risk factors and preventative measures applies to other sleep-related infant deaths. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SIDS is the leading cause of infant mortality between one month and one year of age in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The risk of SIDS in the United States is &lt;1 per 1000 live births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. Higher rates (two to three times the national average) are found in black and American <span class=\"nowrap\">Indian/Alaskan</span> native children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. A disproportionately high rate (15 to 20 percent) of SIDS cases occurs in child care settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. The risk of SIDS is slightly increased in boys (multivariate OR 1.49 [95% CI 1.14-1.83] in one large European case-control study) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>The incidence of SIDS has declined dramatically in countries that have adopted policies encouraging non-prone sleeping (&quot;Back to Sleep&quot; campaigns). The initial campaigns were in Europe, Australia, and New Zealand [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In the United States, the incidence of SIDS has declined by more than 50 percent since the mid-1980s, and the greatest reduction occurred after 1992, when the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) issued a recommendation to reduce the risk of SIDS by placing infants in a supine position for sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. Between 1992 and 2001, the SIDS rate in the United States fell from 1.2 to 0.56 per 1000 live births, while the proportion of infants sleeping in the supine position increased from 13 to 72 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. The rate of SIDS then remained constant between 2001 and 2006 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Similar declines have occurred in other countries after campaigns to encourage non-prone sleeping [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p>Data from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) Collaborative SIDS Study have helped to define the epidemiologic features of SIDS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F75379\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75379 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. This landmark study was a multicenter, population-based, case-controlled project that included 10 percent of the live births in the United States; the study was published in 1988, prior to the widespread use of supine sleep positioning. The pathologic diagnoses were confirmed by an independent panel of forensic pathologists. </p><p>In the NICHD study, the median age for SIDS deaths was 11 weeks, the peak incidence was between two and four months, and 90 percent occurred before 6 months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Approximately 2 percent of cases occur after nine months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. A few sudden unexpected deaths resembling SIDS have been described within the first 24 hours of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. This unique distribution strongly suggests that critical stages of development or maturation affect the risk of SIDS. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Numerous risk factors for SIDS have been identified in observational and case control studies.

Risk factors for SIDS are discussed below. Those that can be modified to decrease the risk of SIDS are also discussed in the section on prevention.

The strongest effect is from smoking during pregnancy, but exposure of an infant to secondhand smoke is an additional independent risk factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. Smoking <span class=\"nowrap\">prevention/intervention</span> programs have the potential to substantially lower SIDS rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/27,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,31</a>]. Several studies have shown abnormal cardiovascular responses to stimuli (eg, head-up tilt, hypoxemia, or CO2 exposure) and impaired arousal to stimuli in infants born to mothers who smoked during pregnancy, suggesting a possible mechanism for this association [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/32-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-37</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-children#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondhand smoke exposure: Effects in children&quot;, section on 'Sudden infant death syndrome'</a>.)</p><p>Maternal drug abuse and all its associated phenomena are also associated with an excessive number of SIDS deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. In one report, a fivefold increase in SIDS risk was reported for infants of substance-abusing mothers in the Los Angeles area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. It is not known if this association is related primarily to the biologic effect of drugs in utero, an increased risk of prematurity and low birth weight, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> other postnatal conditions (socioeconomic, environmental, or parenting behavior). One study found an association between a report of infant maltreatment and subsequent sudden unexpected infant death (SUID), after adjustment for several known SIDS risk factors (hazard ratio 3.22, 95% CI 2.66-3.89) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. It is possible that the observed association is attributable to common risk factors that were not captured in the analysis, including maternal smoking or substance use, or infant sleep position. Alternatively, some of the association may be attributable to unrecognized child maltreatment (intentional or neglect). </p><p>Maternal alcohol use is an important risk factor for SIDS in some populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. In a population-based case-control study among Northern Plains American Indians, SIDS was significantly associated with periconceptional maternal alcohol use (adjusted odds ratio 6.2, 95% CI 1.6-23.3) and first trimester binge drinking (adjusted OR 8.2, 95% CI 1.9-35.3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>Pregnancy complications associated with an increased risk of SIDS include placenta previa, abruptio placenta, premature rupture of membranes, and elevated maternal alpha-fetoprotein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/7,44-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,44-46</a>]. The increased risk associated with these complications appears to be independent of their relationship with preterm birth.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6286769\"><span class=\"h2\">Infant risk factors</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Prematurity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preterm infants are at a higher risk for SIDS than term infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/47-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-49</a>]. Among low and very low birth weight infants, the SIDS rate has consistently been three- to fourfold higher than in term infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. The gestational age of peak vulnerability for SIDS appears to occur four to six weeks earlier among preterm than term infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. It is unclear whether the population of low birth weight infants is experiencing a decline in the rate of SIDS similar to that in the general population. A decline in SIDS rates among preterm infants was noted in New Zealand [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>] but not in Sweden [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Preterm infants are subject to the same risk factors for SIDS as term infants, as discussed in greater detail below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/48,52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,52,53</a>].</p><p>Supine positioning for sleep substantially reduces the risk for SIDS among premature infants. Traditionally, there were some concerns that supine positioning of premature infants may reduce oxygenation in premature infants, as measured by peripheral pulse oximetry. However, two small studies have suggested that this may not be the case, at least among infants who are older than 32 weeks postmenstrual age (ie, gestational age measured from the last menstrual period), and not in the acute phase of a respiratory illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>]. Moreover, another study that included infants as young as 26 weeks gestational age found that cerebral oxygenation was <strong>improved</strong> in the supine compared with prone sleep position, with the maximal effect of sleep position at two to three months chronological age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. A direct connection between cerebral oxygenation and arousal response or SIDS risk has not been established. Nonetheless, these findings lend additional support to the American Academy of Pediatrics' (AAP) recommendation that preterm infants be placed supine for sleep as soon as possible, at least from the postmenstrual age of 32 weeks onward [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/9,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,57</a>]. </p><p>The importance of supine sleep position for premature infants was demonstrated in a population-based case-control study in England, in which the parents of 325 SIDS cases and 1300 age-matched control infants were interviewed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. In multivariate analysis, infants who were small at birth (&lt;37 weeks <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> &lt;2500 g) were five times more likely to die of SIDS than infants who were born at term or &gt;2500 g. However, when infants who were small at birth were placed to sleep on their side or prone, they were 15 and 24 times more likely, respectively, to die of SIDS than infants who were not small at birth who were placed on their backs to sleep.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Low birth weight</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infants born small for gestational age (SGA) have an increased risk for SIDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/7,52,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,52,58</a>]. Low birth weight has a weak but significant association with SIDS risk even after adjustment for gestational age and several other factors known to be associated with low birth weight, including maternal tobacco use and hypertension.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6286913\"><span class=\"h3\">Sibling of SIDS victim</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Siblings of SIDS victims have a five- to sixfold increase in risk for SIDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/59-62\" class=\"abstract_t\">59-62</a>]. However, assuming a SIDS rate of 0.56 per 1000 live births (0.06 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>], the risk in subsequent siblings for most families remains less than 1 percent.</p><p>The small but increased risk of SIDS in siblings of SIDS victims is probably due to a combination of biologic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> epidemiologic factors. However, it has not been possible to identify the relative importance of these factors because many of the risk factors for SIDS are the same as those for other causes of infant mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. In some cases, for example, deaths from inborn errors of metabolism may have been mistaken for SIDS. In other cases, the deaths may have resulted from child abuse or were in some way related to severe deprivation and poverty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].

In a meta-analysis, the combined odds ratio (OR) for bed-sharing versus non bed-sharing infants was 2.89 (95% CI 1.99-4.18) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/107\" class=\"abstract_t\">107</a>]. The risk of bed sharing was greatest for infants younger than three months of age (OR, 10.37; 95% CI 4.44-24.21) or for infants of mothers who smoke (OR, 6.27; 95% CI 3.94-9.99). Similar findings were reported in a large meta-analysis that included 1472 cases of SIDS and 4679 controls from the United Kingdom, Europe, and Australasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/111\" class=\"abstract_t\">111</a>]. Although overall SIDS rates were low, bed-sharing significantly increased SIDS risk in young infants even with no other SIDS risk factors. For infants younger than three months of age, the adjusted odds ratio for bed-sharing was 5.1 (95% CI 2.3-11.4). The risk attributable to bed-sharing was increased up to 15-fold in infants with additional SIDS risk factors, including bottle-feeding, and parental smoking and drinking. In addition, there is a consistent association between increased risk of SIDS and sharing a couch or sofa with parents during sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/19,89,105,106,112\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,89,105,106,112</a>]. Other factors that increase the risk of bed-sharing include soft sleeping surfaces, additional bedding such as pillows and blankets, the presence of multiple bed-sharers, and consumption of alcohol by the bed-sharing adult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The issue of bed-sharing has been controversial. This is in part because the risk of bed-sharing may be relatively low if none of the additional risk factors outlined above are present, and because of potential beneficial effects of bed-sharing on breastfeeding or parental sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/113-116\" class=\"abstract_t\">113-116</a>]. In addition, bed-sharing is a common practice in many cultures: in one study from the United States, 13.5 percent of families with young infants reported bed-sharing as a usual practice in 2010, up from 6.5 percent in 1993 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/117\" class=\"abstract_t\">117</a>]. Nonetheless, we agree with the AAP recommendation against bed-sharing, although room-sharing is encouraged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This is because bed-sharing usually means that the infant sleeps on a surface that is designed for adults, and because some of the other factors that contribute to the risk of bed-sharing cannot be predicted or controlled. Moreover, breastfeeding and parental sleep can still be supported by room-sharing. For convenience, the infant's bed or bassinet can be placed in close proximity to the parents' bed. There is no evidence to suggest that the risk of bed-sharing can be reduced by the use of &quot;co-sleeper&quot; devices that are placed within the parents' bed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Guidelines in the United States and Australia suggest that twins and higher-order multiples also not sleep in the same crib, although this is a common practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/3,118,119\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,118,119</a>]. This suggestion is based on a lack of evidence for either the safety or benefits of bed-sharing by twins, and because these infants are likely to have other risk factors for SIDS, such as low birth weight <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> prematurity. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Car seats and other sitting devices &ndash; </strong>Use of a car seat or other sitting device (stroller, swing, or infant carrier) for sleep has been associated with some sleep-related infant deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. This is because the sitting position tends to potentiate gastroesophageal reflux and may reduce oxygenation in young infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/120,121\" class=\"abstract_t\">120,121</a>]. In addition, some cases have been reported in which an infant suffered suffocation after a car seat accidentally overturned when placed on a soft bed or couch [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/122\" class=\"abstract_t\">122</a>]. Other deaths have been associated with the use of sling carriers (adult-worn soft infant carriers) for young infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/123,124\" class=\"abstract_t\">123,124</a>]. Use of a car seat for car travel has safety benefits that clearly outweigh the small risk of SIDS associated with sleep in these devices. Therefore, the AAP recommends against <strong>routine</strong> use of car seats for sleep outside of a car but continues to strongly recommend their use for car travel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/125\" class=\"abstract_t\">125</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Overheating </strong>&ndash; The risk of SIDS increases with the amount of clothing or blankets on an infant and with room temperature, but it is not clear whether these risks are mediated by head-covering and rebreathing or by overheating [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In a population-based case-control study among Northern Plains American Indians, SIDS was significantly associated with two or more layers of clothing on the infant (adjusted OR 6.2, 95% CI 1.4-26.5) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Another study noted an increased risk with swaddling or in heated rooms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Swaddling</strong> &ndash; Swaddling appears to increase the risk for SIDS, especially for older infants and those who are not placed in a supine position for sleep. In a meta-analysis, based on limited data, the risk of placing an infant on their side or prone for sleep doubled when the infants were swaddled, and the added risk from swaddling increased with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/126\" class=\"abstract_t\">126</a>]. This may be because older infants may attempt to turn over, and swaddling prevents an infant from moving out of an unsafe sleeping position. Swaddled infants are less likely to be aroused by external stimuli, but this effect is not seen in infants who are routinely swaddled, and it is unclear if this is clinically relevant in infants who are in the supine position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/127,128\" class=\"abstract_t\">127,128</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13238420\"><span class=\"h2\">Protective factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following factors are somewhat protective against SIDS.

In a case-control study from New Zealand in which 393 infants who died from SIDS were compared with 1592 controls, the relative risk associated with sleeping in the prone position was reduced by approximately 80 percent if the infant slept in the same room as an adult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/129\" class=\"abstract_t\">129</a>]. A similar reduction in the risk of SIDS was not seen if the infant shared a room with another child. Having the infant sleep in close proximity to the mother (but on separate surfaces) also supports breastfeeding. The optimal age to transition an infant to sleep outside the parents' room has not been established. (See <a href=\"#H6286188\" class=\"local\">'Sleep position and environment'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Breastfeeding</strong> &ndash; Breastfeeding appears to have an independent protective effect against SIDS. In a meta-analysis of eight case-control studies with individual level-data, any breastfeeding for at least two months nearly halved the risk for SIDS, after controlling for potential confounders, such as sleep position, bed-sharing, smoke exposure and sociodemographic factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/130\" class=\"abstract_t\">130</a>]. Protection increased with greater duration of breastfeeding; however, exclusive breastfeeding did not confer additional benefits over partial breastfeeding with regards to SIDS reduction. &#160; &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pacifier use </strong>&ndash; Use of a pacifier (&quot;dummy,&quot; &quot;soother&quot;) during sleep appears to reduce the risk of SIDS. This was shown in a meta-analysis of seven studies, in which the multivariate summary odds ratio was 0.71 [95% CI 0.59-0.85] for usual pacifier use and 0.39 [95% CI 0.31-0.50] for pacifier use during last sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/131\" class=\"abstract_t\">131</a>]. The mechanism for this association is unclear; studies conflict as to whether there is a lowered arousal threshold during pacifier use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/132-135\" class=\"abstract_t\">132-135</a>] (see <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> below). Because of this apparent reduction in risk, the AAP suggests offering a pacifier during sleep, provided that it does not interfere with establishment of breast feeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fan use </strong>&ndash; In a population-based case-control study performed in California, use of a fan was associated with a 72 percent reduction in SIDS risk (adjusted odds ratio 0.28, 95% CI 0.10-0.77) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/136\" class=\"abstract_t\">136</a>].

Because serotonin signaling in the medulla is known to influence a broad range of autonomic processes, these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that SIDS is related to serotonin-mediated dysregulation of the autonomic nervous system. Furthermore, serotonin signaling is altered by exposure to nicotine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/157,159\" class=\"abstract_t\">157,159</a>], providing a potential explanation for the association between maternal smoking and SIDS risk.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Genetic factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The role that genetic factors play in susceptibility to SIDS is not clear.

In another study, arousal thresholds during both active and quiet sleep, were higher in infants younger than five to six months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/187\" class=\"abstract_t\">187</a>]. Measures of cerebral oxygenation are lower in the prone compared with supine position, particularly in preterm infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>], but an association between cerebral oxygenation and arousal threshold has not been established. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Accidental suffocation in the prone position was suggested by a study of 25 infant deaths that occurred during sleep in the prone position on cushions filled with polystyrene beads, accidental suffocation by rebreathing was found to be the most likely cause of death in most of the infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. The cushion was thought to allow limited movement of the infant's head to obtain fresh air, and the estimated amount of subsequent rebreathing was lethal in a rabbit model. Similarly, in a study of 393 cases of SIDS in New Zealand, infants who were found in the prone position with their face down were more likely to be younger, have a low birth weight, and to have used sheepskin bedding or pillows as compared with infants with SIDS found in other positions (prone with face to side, supine, or side) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/192\" class=\"abstract_t\">192</a>].

However, given the limitations of small sample sizes in cross-sectional studies of rare conditions, the incidence and role of cardiac abnormalities in SIDS remains controversial. Based on a study of the prevalence of functionally significant genetic variants associated with long QT syndrome, such abnormalities appear to be present in fewer than 10 percent of SIDS cases.

Autopsy findings in infants dying from SIDS have some similarities with those of infants dying of toxemic shock, although there may be minimal inflammatory tissue reaction. This raises the possibility that some cases of SIDS may have an infectious trigger, leading to a toxic shock-like event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/198,199\" class=\"abstract_t\">198,199</a>].

Variations in the innate immune system, including polymorphisms that result in an exaggerated proinflammatory response, have been found in a higher proportion of SIDS cases than in controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/179,181,198\" class=\"abstract_t\">179,181,198</a>].

More than 70 percent of post-mortem bacteriological samples grow organisms when cultured, but this is not sufficient to attribute infection as a cause or trigger for death. However, one well-conducted study found that infants dying of SIDS were more likely to harbor organisms that are potentially pathogenic, as compared with infants dying from clearly non-infectious causes (eg, accidents or congenital heart disease) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/201\" class=\"abstract_t\">201</a>]. The bacterial colonization documented in this study could also be explained as an epiphenomenon, caused by another established epidemiological risk factor for SIDS such as prone sleeping, but not directly implicated as a cause of death.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Developmental timing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SIDS usually occurs between the second and fourth months of life, a period of remarkable developmental changes in cardiac, ventilatory, and <span class=\"nowrap\">sleep/wake</span> patterns in otherwise normal infants.

Professional staff should instruct and observe closely during skin-to-skin contact and breastfeeding, to ensure that the infant's face is clear and that the airway is not obstructed, and that the mother remains alert [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sudden-infant-death-syndrome-risk-factors-and-risk-reduction-strategies/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Thereafter, infants should be placed supine in a bassinet. Side positioning does not reduce aspiration risk and is <strong>not</strong> recommended. These measures serve to promote breastfeeding, while minimizing risks for SIDS and suffocation.

However, studies done over the past decade have failed to confirm the relationship between SIDS and apnea. Moreover, studies of infants with a history of ALTE and others considered to be at risk for SIDS (such as siblings of SIDS victims) were unable to show any benefit of CR monitoring in preventing SIDS deaths. These issues are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-home-cardiorespiratory-monitors-in-infants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of home cardiorespiratory monitors in infants&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-events-in-infancy-including-brief-resolved-unexplained-event-brue#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute events in infancy including brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE)&quot;, section on 'Prognosis'</a>.) </p><p>Counseling parents of asymptomatic infants with risk factors for SIDS who request a home monitor may be challenging.&nbsp;If parents are concerned about SIDS and request a monitor, we suggest that the clinician engage them in a focused conversation about the potential benefits and risks of using a home monitor before making the decision.

There is no evidence that these devices have any benefit for prevention of SIDS or any other risk.

Second, parents might feel falsely reassured by the use of such devices and fail to use important preventive practices.

(See <a href=\"#H6270404\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SIDS is the leading cause of infant mortality between one month and one year of age in the United States. The rate of SIDS peaks between two and four months of age, and 90 percent of cases occur before six months of age. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mechanism of sudden death is unknown. The most compelling hypothesis involves a brainstem abnormality or maturational delay related to neuroregulation or cardiorespiratory control, combined with a trigger event such as airflow obstruction. The mechanism most likely involves abnormalities of serotonin (5-HT) signaling. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A number of risk factors for SIDS have been identified (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F75379\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75379 \">table 2</a>). These include exposure to cigarette smoke, maternal age &lt;20 years, prematurity, prone sleeping position, soft bedding, and overheating. Apnea of prematurity, although a marker for prematurity, is not a risk factor for SIDS. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To minimize the risk for SIDS, we recommend each of the following measures (see <a href=\"#H6286188\" class=\"local\">'Sleep position and environment'</a> above): </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We recommend that all infants, including those with a history of prematurity who are older than 32 weeks postmenstrual age, be placed to sleep on their backs (supine) for every sleep (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Side sleeping is not recommended. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Sleep position'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We recommend that infants should sleep on a firm sleep surface designed specifically for infants (crib, cradle, or bassinet), without pillows, stuffed toys, or other soft objects, crib bumper pads, blankets or other loose bedding, excessive clothing or sleep positioners (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). They should not sleep on an air <span class=\"nowrap\">mattress/air</span> bed, even if it is fully inflated. We also recommend AGAINST bed-sharing (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>), although room-sharing is encouraged. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Sleep environment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Expectant mothers should avoid smoking during pregnancy because of effects on SIDS risk, in addition to other adverse effects of smoking. Exposure of an infant to secondhand smoke after delivery also probably increases SIDS risk. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Maternal risk factors'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9951026\" class=\"local\">'Other measures'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Measures that may help protect against SIDS risk include breastfeeding and use of a pacifier when placing the infant to sleep. These effects are weak and are outweighed by the modifiable risk factors described above. (See <a href=\"#H13238420\" class=\"local\">'Protective factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of home monitors has not been proven to reduce the incidence of SIDS and is not recommended for this purpose.
