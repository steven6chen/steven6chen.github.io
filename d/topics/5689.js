Drug-induced myopathy ranges from mild myalgias with or without mild weakness to chronic myopathy with severe weakness and to massive rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-myopathies/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Over 150 agents have been associated with rhabdomyolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-myopathies/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This topic will review drug-induced myopathies. Rhabdomyolysis and statin myopathy are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-rhabdomyolysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of rhabdomyolysis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rhabdomyolysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of rhabdomyolysis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=statin-muscle-related-adverse-events\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Statin muscle-related adverse events&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Drug-induced myopathy may result from several different mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-myopathies/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Direct myotoxicity &ndash; Examples include alcohol, cocaine, glucocorticoids, lipid-lowering drugs, antimalarials (which are associated with vacuolar myopathies), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> (which is associated with vacuolar myopathies), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zidovudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zidovudine</a> (which causes a mitochondrial myopathy).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunologically induced inflammatory myopathy &ndash; The myopathy associated with D-penicillamine is an example of this mechanism.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indirect muscle damage &ndash; This problem can occur by a variety of mechanisms including drug-induced coma with subsequent ischemic muscle compression, drug-induced hypokalemia (eg, diuretics), drug-induced hyperkinetic states (eg, delirium tremens or seizures secondary to alcohol), dystonic states associated with phenothiazines, hyperthermia related to cocaine use, and the neuroleptic malignant syndrome.</p><p/><p>In some settings, multiple mechanisms may combine to produce muscle damage. As an example, alcoholic binges may precipitate hypokalemia, hypophosphatemia, coma, or agitation; in addition, direct muscle toxicity may also be present.</p><p>Intramuscular injections, particularly repeated injections of opiates (eg, heroin or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentazocine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pentazocine</a>), may cause muscle damage with a fibrotic reaction that can result in muscle contractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-myopathies/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Inadvertent intraarterial injections may cause ischemic necrosis of muscle tissue that is typically associated with livedoid skin changes or skin infarction (Nicolau syndrome) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-myopathies/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DRUGS CAUSING DIRECT MYOTOXICITY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Alcohol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alcohol use can lead both to an acute myopathy and to a chronic myopathy that differ in alcohol consumption history, in demographics, and in clinical manifestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-myopathies/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Acute myopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute alcoholic myopathy usually occurs in the setting of longstanding alcoholism, within hours after a particularly severe alcoholic binge (often one lasting several days). The vast majority of reported cases have been among male alcoholics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-myopathies/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The severity of attacks varies from asymptomatic increases in creatine kinase (CK) to severe myopathy with rhabdomyolysis; acute alcoholic myopathy is one of the most common causes of nontraumatic rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-myopathies/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Recurrent episodes of acute myopathy can occur following bouts of binge drinking.</p><p>The pathogenesis of acute myopathy probably involves the direct effect of alcohol or of one of its metabolites on muscle cell intermediary metabolism and on muscle cell membrane structure and function that affect transmembrane permeability of ions and water. Hypokalemia and hypophosphatemia, commonly seen in chronic alcoholics, may potentiate muscle toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-myopathies/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypophosphatemia-in-the-alcoholic-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypophosphatemia in the alcoholic patient&quot;</a>). Although other causes of rhabdomyolysis commonly occur in alcoholics, including seizures, delirium tremens, and coma, acute myopathy can clearly occur in the absence of any of these factors.</p><p>Acute myopathy appears to be related to the dose of alcohol ingested. This may explain why episodes of acute myopathy are more common during drinking binges accompanied by fasting. Starvation decreases alcohol metabolism and results in increased blood alcohol levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-myopathies/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, acute elevations of serum CK levels and myopathic histologic changes have been induced in normal volunteers given large doses of alcohol in the absence of malnutrition or starvation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-myopathies/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Affected patients present with muscle cramps, tenderness, and, often, swelling. Muscle involvement is usually generalized, although there is a predilection for the calf muscles. CK and other muscle enzymes may be markedly elevated. Peak CK elevation may occur at the time of or several days after admission to the hospital [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-myopathies/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. It has been postulated that phosphate depletion associated with excessive alcohol consumption may be aggravated by refeeding in the hospital without first restoring muscle phosphate, which then leads to further muscle damage (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hypophosphatemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hypophosphatemia&quot;</a>). Muscle biopsy demonstrates muscle fiber necrosis with subsequent degeneration and regeneration.</p><p>The typical course of acute alcoholic myopathy is full recovery of muscle and renal function after cessation of alcohol intake and management of any complications of rhabdomyolysis unless underlying chronic alcoholic described below is also present, in which case recovery only back to a previous baseline occurs (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Chronic myopathy'</a> below). Recovery of muscle strength can be expected within days to weeks, even in individuals with recurrent attacks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Chronic myopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic alcoholic myopathy presents with the gradual onset of diffuse, usually proximal, muscle weakness over a period of weeks to months. Diffuse muscle atrophy is common. Muscle pain and tenderness are usually absent. CK and other muscle enzymes typically are normal or are only mildly elevated, and myoglobinuric renal failure does not occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-myopathies/abstract/8,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,12</a>].</p><p>Female alcoholics may be at increased risk for chronic myopathy. In one study, for example, females developed myopathy at lower cumulative doses of alcohol than male alcoholics even when corrected for body weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-myopathies/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Chronic myopathy usually occurs in malnourished alcoholics, but it has been clearly observed in well-nourished ambulatory patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-myopathies/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>The mechanism of chronic alcoholic myopathy is incompletely understood. Direct toxic effects of alcohol or one of its metabolites on skeletal and cardiac muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-myopathies/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], chronic malnutrition, chronic disuse, and chronic electrolyte abnormalities all are likely to contribute to the onset of weakness and to type II fiber atrophy.</p><p>Other sequelae of chronic alcoholism, including peripheral neuropathy, cirrhosis, and Wernicke&rsquo;s encephalopathy, are often present. There is also a close clinical and histologic correlation between the presence of chronic myopathy and the development of alcoholic cardiomyopathy; both correlate with total lifetime alcohol consumption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-myopathies/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Some patients with chronic myopathy have a history of recurrent acute alcoholic myopathy, although the latter does not seem to be a prerequisite for the former.</p><p>In one study of 50 ambulatory chronic alcoholics, it was estimated that, among those who drank more than 13 kg per kilogram of bodyweight cumulative lifetime dose, more than one-half developed symptomatic chronic myopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-myopathies/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This dose translates into approximately 12 oz (350 mL) of 86-proof whiskey a day for 20 years in a 70 kg man. No cases of myopathy occurred at lower cumulative doses.</p><p>Muscle biopsy in chronic alcoholics almost universally demonstrates some ultrastructural abnormalities on electron microscopy even in the absence of clinically apparent weakness or of myopathic changes on light microscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-myopathies/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Typical histologic findings in patients with chronic myopathy include increased fat accumulation and type II fiber atrophy that is indistinguishable from changes seen in glucocorticoid-induced myopathy or in disuse atrophy. Muscle fiber necrosis is either absent or minimal, as are inflammatory infiltrates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-myopathies/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Abstinence from alcohol may lead to recovery of muscle strength. In addition, serial biopsies in patients who abstain have shown significant improvement in the degree of type II muscle fiber atrophy over a period of 3 to 18 months; in the same report, those who continued to drink showed an increase in atrophy when rebiopsied 3 to 10 months later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-myopathies/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glucocorticoids are a common cause of drug-induced myopathy. Muscle weakness associated with the use of glucocorticoids may complicate parenteral short-term and high-dose use, particularly in the setting of a critical illness. Longer-term use of moderate- or high-dose oral glucocorticoids may produce a more insidious onset of weakness. Critical illness myopathy and glucocorticoid-induced myopathy are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuromuscular-weakness-related-to-critical-illness\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuromuscular weakness related to critical illness&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucocorticoid-induced-myopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glucocorticoid-induced myopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Lipid-lowering drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lipid-lowering drugs, primarily the statins, are another common cause of myopathy. Muscle injury due to statins, fibrates, and other lipid-lowering drugs is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=statin-muscle-related-adverse-events\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Statin muscle-related adverse events&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Cocaine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Muscle injury ranging from asymptomatic CK elevation to massive rhabdomyolysis with acute renal failure has been reported following cocaine use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-myopathies/abstract/17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20</a>]. Cocaine use is the most common cause of illicit drug-induced medical problems in the United States, including muscle disease. In one report, at least 5 percent of cocaine users presenting to one emergency department had evidence of muscle injury based upon CK elevation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-myopathies/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Direct cocaine-induced muscle injury may result from the markedly increased sympathomimetic activity induced by cocaine. Severe arterial vasoconstriction can cause skeletal muscle ischemia and infarction in the same manner, as cocaine-induced vasospasm causes myocardial, cerebral, skin, or digital infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-myopathies/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. An alternative mechanism is cocaine-induced inhibition of the reuptake of catecholamines at alpha adrenergic receptors, which, in turn, leads to high intracellular calcium levels in muscle cells and to subsequent cell damage and rhabdomyolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-myopathies/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Cocaine users with muscle injury usually present to emergency departments with other problems, including delirium, fever, seizure, cardiovascular collapse, or chest pain, and are found incidentally to have muscle involvement. In some cases, however, myalgias are an important presenting symptom. Muscle injury can occur after oral or intranasal cocaine use but may be more common after intravenous use or after smoking the alkaloid-free base (crack cocaine) because of the more rapid and higher blood levels of the drug achieved via those routes. Muscle injury can occur after a one-time use of the drug or after repeated use. The onset of muscle involvement is usually within hours after drug administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-myopathies/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>CK elevation ranges from a few times normal to marked elevations of greater than 50,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L</span>. In one report, for example, the mean CK maximum elevation in 39 patients with cocaine-associated rhabdomyolysis was 12,187 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-myopathies/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The patients with the highest CK levels are at greatest risk for acute myoglobinuric renal failure. These individuals usually, but not always, have additional risk factors for rhabdomyolysis resulting from cocaine use, including marked fever, agitation, hypotension, seizures, coma, or concomitant use of heroin, amphetamines, or phencyclidine (drugs which are also associated with rhabdomyolysis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-myopathies/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-heme-pigment-induced-acute-kidney-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of heme pigment-induced acute kidney injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Antimalarial drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antimalarial drugs used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus have been reported to cause a toxic neuropathy, myopathy, and cardiomyopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-myopathies/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Most of the case reports have involved <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chloroquine</a>, but <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a> and (in one instance) amodiaquine have also been implicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-myopathies/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Myopathy is a rare complication of these drugs; one study estimated the incidence to be 1 in 100 patient-years, although this has not been confirmed by others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-myopathies/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Another study identified 12 cases of hydroxychloroquine neuromyotoxicity that had been reported in the medical literature between 1965 and 1998 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-myopathies/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>The duration of antimalarial therapy prior to the onset of weakness varies widely from less than one year to more than 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-myopathies/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The development of myopathy does not seem to relate to dose, as nearly all cases occur with use of standard doses.</p><p>Antimalarial neuromyopathy is thought to be due to the accumulation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chloroquine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a> in lysosomes and to the subsequent inhibition of lysosomal enzymes. Phospholipid and glycogen then accumulate in the lysosomes, producing the characteristic myeloid and curvilinear bodies seen on biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-myopathies/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Patients with myopathy present with proximal muscle weakness, usually without muscle pain. Peripheral sensory abnormalities, including decreased vibratory sense and absent deep tendon reflexes, may also be present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-myopathies/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Muscle enzymes may be normal or mildly elevated (usually not more than three to four times normal). Electromyography (EMG) shows both myopathic and neuropathic changes. Muscle biopsy reveals type II fiber atrophy, evidence of neurogenic muscle fiber atrophy, and vacuoles on light microscopy; electron microscopy shows curvilinear bodies and lysosomal proliferation. Nerve biopsy has shown evidence of a toxic neuropathy; curvilinear bodies have also been demonstrated in neural pericytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-myopathies/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Antimalarial cardiomyopathy may present as a conduction system abnormality or as congestive heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-myopathies/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The electrocardiogram shows nonspecific T-wave abnormalities, and echocardiography and cardiac catheterization show evidence of restrictive cardiomyopathy with thickened ventricular walls and with reduced ventricular cavity size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-myopathies/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows evidence of a nonischemic cardiomyopathy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F87852\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef87852 \">image 1</a>). Endomyocardial biopsy shows changes similar to skeletal muscle, including degeneration of myocytes, which appear enlarged and markedly vacuolated on light microscopy, with cytoplasmic vacuoles and granules (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F87854\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87854 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F87853\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87853 \">picture 2</a>), and shows the presence on electron microscopy of numerous large, complex, secondary lysosomes with curvilinear bodies and myeloid bodies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F87855\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87855 \">picture 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-myopathies/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>The diagnosis of antimalarial-induced myopathy or cardiomyopathy is based on the constellation of clinical findings (myopathy, neuropathy, heart failure, or conduction abnormalities), hemodynamic findings (restrictive cardiac physiology), and histologic findings (the presence of lysosomal curvilinear bodies on electron microscopy is highly suggestive of antimalarial toxicity) in the setting of usually long-term antimalarial treatment.</p><p>The clinical response to the discontinuation of the antimalarial is variable. Progression of weakness is halted in most patients within weeks to months after cessation of the offending drug with improvement in clinical and histologic status in some. However, continued progression resulting in worsening weakness, cardiac transplantation, and even death can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-myopathies/abstract/24,26,30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,26,30,31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Antipsychotic drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Phenothiazines and other antipsychotic drugs are associated with the neuroleptic malignant syndrome that is characterized by fever and by muscular rigidity and that may have elevation of CK indicative of muscle injury.

Typically, the patient with chronic colchicine neuromyopathy will have been treated with daily low-dose colchicine (0.5 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> for months to years; in one documented case, however, myopathy occurred within two weeks of starting colchicine therapy at a dose of 0.6 mg three times daily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-myopathies/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>The pathogenesis of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colchicine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colchicine</a> neuromyopathy is unknown. It is thought to be related to colchicine&rsquo;s known effect on microtubule function, leading to impaired axonal transport in peripheral nerves and to alteration of the muscle cytoskeleton that is necessary for the normal movement of lysosomes in the cell [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-myopathies/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Chronic kidney disease leading to increased plasma colchicine levels appears to be the major risk factor for neuromyopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-myopathies/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The risk is also increased when CYP34A inhibitors, including macrolide antibiotics, cyclosporin, azoles, and protease inhibitors, are used concurrently with colchicine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-myopathies/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-gout-flares#H351173490\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of gout flares&quot;, section on 'Safety of colchicine'</a>.)</p><p>Affected patients typically present with proximal muscle weakness, often more prominent in the lower than upper extremities. CK levels are almost always elevated, usually 10-to 20-fold above normal. EMG and nerve conduction studies document myopathic changes and an accompanying axonal polyneuropathy that is usually asymptomatic or that causes mild sensory symptoms and diminished deep tendon reflexes. Myotonic discharges may be noted in some patients and have been correlated with clinical findings of myotonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-myopathies/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. Muscle biopsy shows vacuolar changes in muscle cells that are seen best on frozen sections, since the vacuoles are often damaged by paraffin fixation.

Acute alcoholic myopathy usually occurs in the setting of longstanding alcoholism, within hours after a particularly severe alcoholic binge. Acute alcoholic myopathy is one of the most common causes of nontraumatic rhabdomyolysis and acute renal failure. Chronic alcoholic myopathy presents with the gradual onset of diffuse, usually proximal, muscle weakness over a period of weeks to months. Diffuse muscle atrophy is common.
