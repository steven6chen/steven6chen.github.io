In the United States, it is estimated that there is a 5 to 10 percent lifetime risk for women undergoing surgery for a suspected ovarian neoplasm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-an-adnexal-mass/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Adnexal masses may be found in females of all ages, fetuses to the elderly, and there is a wide variety of types of masses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F107713\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107713 \">table 1</a>). The management of an adnexal mass depends upon the type of mass, urgency of the presentation (eg, ectopic pregnancy or ovarian torsion require immediate intervention), and degree of suspicion that the mass is malignant. </p><p>The management of patients with an adnexal mass is reviewed here. The initial approach to, and an overview of, the evaluation of patients with an adnexal mass and other topics related to the management of an adnexal mass are discussed separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-an-adnexal-mass\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with an adnexal mass&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ectopic-pregnancy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ectopic pregnancy: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ovarian and fallopian tube torsion&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-ruptured-ovarian-cyst\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of ruptured ovarian cyst&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ovarian-cysts-and-neoplasms-in-infants-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ovarian cysts and neoplasms in infants, children, and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25409875\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management of an adnexal mass depends upon the location and etiology of the mass (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F107713\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107713 \">table 1</a>) and the characteristics of the patient. In general, there are three options for managing an adnexal mass:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery &ndash; Surgery is performed for the following indications: malignancy is suspected; there are other risks associated with the mass (eg, torsion, infection), or the mass is symptomatic. For ovarian masses, an oophorectomy or ovarian cystectomy may be performed. For other adnexal masses, the mass may be biopsied or resected.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Continued surveillance &ndash; Continued surveillance is indicated if the suspicion of malignancy is low, but it has not been completely excluded. Surveillance usually includes serial pelvic ultrasounds <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> measurement of serum tumor markers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Expectant management &ndash; If the apparent etiology of the mass is benign and there are no other indications for surgery or surveillance, no further follow-up is needed.</p><p/><p>The choice between these management options for different adult patient populations is discussed in the sections that follow. Management of an adnexal mass in a child or adolescent is discussed separately.

For women with a mass that is suspicious for malignancy after an initial evaluation, surgical exploration is required. </p><p>Surgical evaluation is the standard approach to the evaluation of an adnexal mass because there is no noninvasive technique for the diagnosis of ovarian cancer. Unfortunately, this approach results in many women undergoing surgery for a benign mass. As an example, in a large ovarian cancer screening randomized trial, among 570 women who underwent surgical evaluation for suspected ovarian cancer, 20 cases of malignancy were found (3.5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-an-adnexal-mass/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Another large ovarian cancer screening trial, the United Kingdom Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening (UKTOCS), found that for each ovarian or peritoneal cancer detected by ultrasound screening, an additional 10 women underwent surgery for normal ovaries or benign pathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-an-adnexal-mass/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, the prognosis of ovarian cancer is poor unless the disease is treated at an early stage and the risk of failing to diagnose a life-threatening condition, no matter how small, must be weighed against the potential morbidity associated with surgical intervention. </p><p>In some cases, if malignancy seems unlikely but has not been fully excluded, continued surveillance is warranted. (See <a href=\"#H10104063\" class=\"local\">'Surveillance'</a> below.)</p><p>The information used to evaluate an adnexal mass is briefly reviewed here, and is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-an-adnexal-mass#H3884375\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with an adnexal mass&quot;, section on 'Evaluation for malignancy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1591534\"><span class=\"h3\">Assessing risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most important factor used to determine the clinical suspicion of malignancy of an adnexal mass is the appearance of the mass on imaging; transvaginal ultrasound is the preferred study. The sensitivity of pelvic ultrasound for the diagnosis of ovarian cancer ranged from 86 to 91 percent and the specificity ranged from 68 to 83 percent in a large meta-analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-an-adnexal-mass/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>Ultrasound morphology associated with malignancy includes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F79259\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79259 \">table 2</a>): (1) a solid component or nodularity, particularly with color or power Doppler demonstration of flow in the solid component; (2) thick septations (&gt;2 to 3 mm). Based upon the ultrasound morphology, in our practice, we categorize masses into the following risk groups:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High risk &ndash; Features of malignancy, ie, solid, nodular, thick septations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F79259\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79259 \">table 2</a>) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intermediate risk &ndash; Not anechoic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> unilocular, but no features of malignancy (eg, a mass with thin septations or low level echoes) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low risk &ndash; Anechoic unilocular fluid filled cysts with thin walls</p><p/><p>Historically, size of the mass was considered useful, with larger masses considered more likely to be malignant. While many ovarian malignancies are larger masses, as a general statement this relationship has not been confirmed, as several studies have found no significant difference in size between malignant and benign masses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-an-adnexal-mass/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. For example, a 10 cm simple cyst is <strong>not</strong> more worrisome for malignancy than a 2 cm cyst with solid vegetative nodule. Similarly, a 10 cm mass with multiple features of a benign teratoma is not more worrisome than a 2 cm mass with multiple features of a cystadenocarcinoma. The data does show that size of any suspected solid component of an adnexal mass is a risk factor for malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-an-adnexal-mass/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ultrasound-differentiation-of-benign-versus-malignant-adnexal-masses\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ultrasound differentiation of benign versus malignant adnexal masses&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Size of an ovarian mass does matter for risk of development of symptoms, rupture, or torsion. Also, the larger the mass, the less certain the sonologist can be about the content of the mass. At a certain size, one must abandon transvaginal sonography for the less accurate transabdominal approach. Finally, a certain subset of these masses will continue to grow so one would rather remove them when they are within range for laparoscopic management. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-ruptured-ovarian-cyst\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of ruptured ovarian cyst&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ovarian-and-fallopian-tube-torsion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ovarian and fallopian tube torsion&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If imaging findings suggestive of metastatic disease are present, even in the absence of malignant features in the mass itself, surgical exploration is required. These features include: ascites or evidence of metastatic disease (eg, peritoneal masses, enlarged lymph nodes).

The management of an individual patient depends upon the clinical features of that patient and upon clinical judgement. If there is uncertainty about the appropriate management decision, a gynecologic oncologist should be consulted. (See <a href=\"#H15998736\" class=\"local\">'Referral to a specialist'</a> below.)</p><p>Women with a hereditary ovarian cancer syndrome (<em>BRCA</em> mutation or Lynch syndrome) are managed differently than the general population. In these women, the presence of almost any adnexal mass is an indication for surgical exploration. This is discussed in detail separately.

Many women may be managed with surveillance, but surgical exploration should be performed if clinically significant risk factors or symptoms are present.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low risk &ndash; For most women with a unilocular anechoic ovarian cyst and no other findings suggestive of malignancy, we suggest surveillance rather than surgery because the risk of malignancy is less than the risk of complications associated with surgical exploration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-an-adnexal-mass/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p/><p>For postmenopausal women with a mass with an intermediate or low risk appearance, surgical exploration is required if a serum tumor marker is elevated. CA 125 is the tumor marker used most commonly for the detection of epithelial ovarian cancer. CA 125 &gt;35 <span class=\"nowrap\">U/mL</span> has a sensitivity of 69 to 97 percent and a specificity of 81 to 93 percent for the diagnosis of ovarian cancer, based upon data from a meta-analysis of six studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-an-adnexal-mass/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The marker algorithms OVA1 and ROMA may be used to decide whether to refer a patient to a gynecologic oncologist. Other serum markers are used to evaluate women for less common histologic types, germ cell and sex cord-stromal tumors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=serum-biomarkers-for-evaluation-of-an-adnexal-mass-for-epithelial-carcinoma-of-the-ovary-fallopian-tube-or-peritoneum#H12758113\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Serum biomarkers for evaluation of an adnexal mass for epithelial carcinoma of the ovary, fallopian tube, or peritoneum&quot;, section on 'Referral to a gynecologic oncologist'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-an-adnexal-mass#H5378980\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with an adnexal mass&quot;, section on 'Serum markers for other histologic types'</a>.)</p><p>Size of the mass must also be considered. There are limited data to establish the size threshold that requires surgical removal. We suggest surgical exploration rather than surveillance for postmenopausal women with a mass that is &ge;10 cm in diameter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-an-adnexal-mass/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. In addition, in our practice, we proceed with surgical exploration for women with a 5 to 10 cm mass who also have symptoms suggestive of ovarian cancer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F78148\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78148 \">table 4</a>). However, some patients without symptoms or other findings suggestive of malignancy may request removal of a mass &lt;10 cm. In such cases, removal is reasonable if the patient strongly prefers surgical evaluation and removal of the mass and is willing to accept the risks of surgical morbidity and loss of an ovary. &#160;</p><p>Risk factors (other than a hereditary ovarian cancer syndrome) or symptoms alone are not typically an indication for surgery in a woman with a mass with an intermediate or low risk appearance. The absence of risk factors and symptoms helps to support a decision to manage the patient with surveillance.</p><p>In some cases, an adnexal mass in a postmenopausal woman was noted on imaging prior to menopause and is unchanged; this information is reassuring and surveillance is typically appropriate for these patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H535724\"><span class=\"h3\">Premenopausal women</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An ovarian mass in a premenopausal woman is often a diagnostic dilemma. The risk of ovarian, fallopian tubal, or peritoneal cancer is low in this age group, but the possibility of malignancy should be considered in all patients with an adnexal mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-an-adnexal-mass/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The incidence of ovarian cancer increases with age (1.8 to 2.2 per 100,000 women for ages 20 to 29 years; 3.1 to 5.1 for ages 30 to 39 years; and 9.0 to 15.2 for ages 40 to 49 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-an-adnexal-mass/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>For premenopausal women with an adnexal mass, the decision whether to proceed with surgical evaluation depends upon the characteristics of the mass and the patient. If there is evidence on imaging studies of metastatic disease, surgical exploration is required, even in the absence of malignant features in the mass itself. As with postmenopausal women, we categorize patients according to risk of malignancy based upon ultrasound morphology (see <a href=\"#H1591534\" class=\"local\">'Assessing risk'</a> above): </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High risk &ndash; Similar to postmenopausal women, surgery is required for women with a mass with features associated with malignancy or any adnexal mass combined with ascites <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> evidence of metastatic disease consistent with ovarian cancer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F79259\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79259 \">table 2</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Intermediate/low</span> risk &ndash; Many masses related to reproductive function occur in premenopausal women, and thus, there is likely to be a greater proportion of patients with a mass with an intermediate or low risk appearance. For most premenopausal women with a mass with an intermediate or low risk appearance, we suggest surveillance rather than surgery. The exceptions to this are women with a very elevated serum CA 125 or those in whom a germ cell or sex cord-stromal tumor is suspected. These neoplasms are uncommon, but often occur in younger women. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ovarian-germ-cell-tumors-pathology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ovarian germ cell tumors: Pathology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis overview'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-sex-cord-stromal-tumors-of-the-ovary#H727968\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of sex cord-stromal tumors of the ovary&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><br/>In premenopausal women, we measure a serum CA 125 <strong>only</strong> if the ultrasound appearance of a mass raises sufficient suspicion of malignancy to warrant a repeat ultrasound or surgical evaluation. In this population, a CA 125 value of &gt;35 <span class=\"nowrap\">U/mL</span> has a sensitivity and specificity of less than 80 percent, and possibly as low as 50 to 60 percent, based upon data from a meta-analysis of six studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-an-adnexal-mass/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The low specificity in premenopausal women is because an elevated CA 125 is also associated with many conditions other than ovarian cancer, and many of these are found in reproductive age patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F81621\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81621 \">table 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F67514\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67514 \">figure 1</a>). Based upon the poor diagnostic performance of CA 125 in premenopausal women, there has been some discussion of using a higher CA 125 level (&gt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">U/mL),</span> but this has been evaluated in few studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-an-adnexal-mass/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The markers OVA1 and ROMA may be used to decide whether to refer a patient to a gynecologic oncologist. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-an-adnexal-mass#H5379592\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with an adnexal mass&quot;, section on 'Serum markers for epithelial ovarian carcinoma'</a> and <a href=\"#H15998736\" class=\"local\">'Referral to a specialist'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Risk factors (other than a hereditary ovarian cancer syndrome) or symptoms may increase the degree of suspicion of malignancy, but are not typically the sole indication for surgery in a woman with a mass with an intermediate or low risk appearance. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H535940\"><span class=\"h3\">Management options</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10104048\"><span class=\"h4\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical exploration for an adnexal mass may be performed laparoscopically (conventional or robotic) or via a laparotomy. The choice of surgical approach depends upon the degree of suspicion of malignancy and surgeon and patient preference. Ovarian cancer staging can be performed using an open or laparoscopic approach, although the majority of surgeons in current practice prefer laparotomy if there is a high degree of suspicion of malignancy. If there is a low or moderate suspicion of malignancy, a laparoscopic approach is typically used. Laparoscopy is associated with a shorter recovery and decreased perioperative morbidity compared with laparotomy. When choosing a surgical approach for a suspected malignancy, it is important to keep in mind that it is unclear if laparoscopy is as sensitive as laparotomy in the detection of small metastatic implants in small bowel mesentery and epigastrium. Laparoscopy is clearly superior to laparotomy for inspection of the diaphragm and for visible peritoneal surfaces.</p><p>The surgical technique used must minimize the potential for tumor disruption or dissemination. If malignancy is suspected, oophorectomy is required rather than ovarian cystectomy. Patients with early stage ovarian cancer (ie, no malignant cells in ascites or peritoneal cytology) benefit from removal of the adnexal mass intact, since opening the mass results in a more advanced stage and adversely affects prognosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F113545\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113545 \">table 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-an-adnexal-mass/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. In addition, every attempt must be made to provide the pathologist with an ovarian specimen with an intact cortex. If a laparoscopic approach is used, the ovary can be placed in a tissue recovery bag. If the specimen is too large to remove through the existing incisions, cyst fluid may be aspirated (but the collapsed cyst should not be disrupted) or the incision may be enlarged. The practice of morcellating an ovarian mass in a bag is discouraged because it may compromise pathology evaluation. In general, aspiration of cyst contents is not advisable as the sole surgical intervention because no tissue is obtained for histopathology and cytology of cyst fluid is not reliable for exclusion of malignancy, and there is a high rate of recurrence. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oophorectomy-and-ovarian-cystectomy#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oophorectomy and ovarian cystectomy&quot;, section on 'Aspiration and fenestration versus cystectomy'</a>.)</p><p>For premenopausal women, ovarian cystectomy is reasonable if the preoperative suspicion of malignancy is low, the mass appears benign intraoperatively, and there is no evidence of metastatic disease. Every safeguard against intraoperative rupture of the mass should be taken.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10104063\"><span class=\"h4\">Surveillance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women for whom the likelihood of ovarian cancer appears low, but has not been fully excluded, should be managed with continued surveillance with serial pelvic ultrasounds, and, if appropriate, a serum tumor marker. There is no evidence to establish the best approach to surveillance of an ovarian mass. The approach we use in our practice is presented here.</p><p>Physiologic cysts typically resolve on follow-up, non-physiologic non-neoplastic benign simple cysts usually remain unchanged, and neoplastic simple cysts enlarge over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-an-adnexal-mass/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p>The largest study to-date to evaluate use of serial pelvic sonography for adnexal masses was a prospective study of over 39,000 asymptomatic women followed with annual transvaginal pelvic sonography during the 25-year period of the study (average duration of follow-up was 7.3 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-an-adnexal-mass/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The criteria for inclusion were: (1) age 50 years or older or (2) age 25 years or older with a family history of ovarian cancer (genetic testing was not part of the study protocol); mean age was 58.6 years (range 25 to 95). Over the period of follow-up, 17.3 percent were found to have an ovarian abnormality on their first or later visits and 42.1 percent of abnormalities resolved within one year. As expected, the prevalence of abnormalities was significantly higher in premenopausal than postmenopausal women (34.9 versus 17.0 percent) and low-risk abnormalities (unilocular cyst, cyst with septation) were more common than high-risk (cyst with solid area, solid mass) (prevalence 21.3 versus 8.9 percent). Interestingly, low-risk compared with high-risk abnormalities were less likely to resolve within one year and took longer to resolve (resolved at one year: 33 to 44 percent versus 77 to 81 percent; median time to resolution 53 to 56 weeks versus 8 to 9 weeks). Surgery was performed on 557 women for 85 ovarian malignancies and 472 nonmalignant abnormalities. &#160;</p><p>This study also evaluated the impact of bilaterality and ovarian mass size for high-risk abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-an-adnexal-mass/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Most masses resolved, whether unilateral or bilateral, but bilateral solid masses compared with cysts with a solid area resolved more quickly (approximately one versus seven years). Similarly, larger masses (&gt;10 cm<sup>3</sup>) resolved more slowly, but this effect was most notable in solid masses (&lt;5 cm<sup>3</sup> resolved in three years versus 10 to 19.9 cm<sup>3</sup> in five years). The findings of this study support the practice of serial sonography to evaluate indeterminate adnexal masses, but don&rsquo;t provide data regarding the frequency of surveillance. The ability to generalize these results to the general population is somewhat limited, since the premenopausal participants were chosen based upon a family history of ovarian cancer. The biologic basis of the finding that complex masses resolved more quickly is uncertain, unless the majority of these were hemorrhagic cysts. This warrants further analysis of these data and further study. </p><p>For postmenopausal women with a simple ovarian cyst, several studies have examined the role of pelvic examination, ultrasound, and tumor marker measurement (particularly CA 125) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-an-adnexal-mass/abstract/19-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-25</a>]. In the largest of these studies, 2763 postmenopausal women were diagnosed with 3259 simple cysts up to 10 cm in diameter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-an-adnexal-mass/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Serial follow-up ultrasounds were performed every three to six months. Spontaneous resolution of the simple cysts occurred in 2261 women (69 percent) over a mean follow-up of six years. Ten patients were subsequently diagnosed with ovarian cancer: <span class=\"nowrap\">7/10</span> had additional abnormal areas which were identified on an interval ultrasound examination, <span class=\"nowrap\">2/10</span> developed ovarian cancer after the cyst in question had resolved on sonographic follow-up, and <span class=\"nowrap\">1/10</span> developed cancer in the ovary opposite the cyst being followed. </p><p>In premenopausal women, 70 percent of adnexal masses will resolve over the course of several menstrual cycles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-an-adnexal-mass/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p>When patients with an adnexal mass are managed with surveillance, it is important to counsel the patient about what morphologic or size changes would prompt surgical exploration and when surveillance will be stopped if there are no significant changes. During surveillance, if the mass develops features of malignancy, increases in size to &ge;10 cm, or the CA 125 increases to &gt;35 <span class=\"nowrap\">U/mL,</span> we proceed with surgery. If the mass resolves, we discontinue surveillance. If the mass remains unchanged or decreases in size and the CA 125 remains &lt;35 <span class=\"nowrap\">U/mL,</span> surveillance continues until the planned stopping point is reached.</p><p>For <strong>postmenopausal</strong> women:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intermediate risk mass &ndash; We repeat a transvaginal ultrasound and CA 125 in six weeks and then again six weeks later.

If an initial level was drawn and was very elevated, we proceed with surgery. If the initial level was &lt;35 <span class=\"nowrap\">U/mL,</span> we do not repeat it. If it was moderately elevated (35 to &lt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">U/mL),</span> we draw it with each ultrasound until a pattern emerges. If it is consistently low or moderately elevated, we discontinue CA 125 testing. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7610682\"><span class=\"h2\">Benign mass</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some benign ovarian masses have characteristic sonographic features and the diagnosis is fairly certain without surgical exploration, including: follicular or corpus luteal cysts, endometriomas, and mature teratomas (dermoid). Surgery is not required for follicular or corpus luteal cysts. Surgical treatment of endometriomas depends upon whether the patient is symptomatic. Most mature teratomas are benign, but surgery is indicated to exclude malignancy and prevent malignant transformation (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ovarian-germ-cell-tumors-pathology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ovarian germ cell tumors: Pathology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Mature teratoma (dermoid)'</a>). For any ovarian mass, however, if the diagnosis is uncertain, further evaluation is required.

This occurs most commonly in physiologic cysts that are associated with the menstrual cycle (follicular cysts, corpus luteal cysts). </p><p>A ruptured or hemorrhagic ovarian cyst is occasionally accompanied by significant bleeding. Women with uncomplicated cyst rupture (hemodynamically stable, no evidence ongoing blood loss on laboratory evaluation or pelvic imaging) can be managed expectantly. Women with complicated cyst rupture require hospital admission for close monitoring, with a possible need for surgical intervention <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> blood product replacement. &#160;</p><p>The evaluation and management of a ruptured ovarian cyst are discussed separately.

Since many cysts are transient and the pain will resolve with the cyst, these symptoms are best managed with analgesics in the short term while the patient is evaluated and it is determined whether surgery is needed for another indication (eg, suspicion of malignancy, infertility). </p><p>A particular type of ovarian mass, an endometrioma, may be associated with dysmenorrhea, pelvic pain, or dyspareunia. These masses are usually recognized by their characteristic appearance on ultrasound. They are also often associated with endometriosis at other sites within the pelvis. Surgical removal is the usual treatment of a symptomatic endometrioma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-management-of-ovarian-endometriomas#H363548546\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometriosis: Management of ovarian endometriomas&quot;, section on 'Our approach'</a>.)</p><p>Some women will have an ovarian mass with an indeterminate appearance on ultrasound, but with no features of malignancy. In such cases, other sources of pelvic pain should be investigated. However, if no other etiology of the pain is identified and the pain is persistent and not relieved by analgesics, we suggest ovarian cystectomy or oophorectomy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15998498\"><span class=\"h3\">Infertility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endometriomas are a type of ovarian mass that is associated with infertility, and these should be removed in infertile patients.

However, an ovarian mass may adversely affect fertility if it undergoes torsion or ruptures. &#160;</p><p>On the other hand, removal of an adnexal mass in a premenopausal woman may lead to adhesion formation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> reduce ovarian reserve, potentially adversely impacting fertility. </p><p>A hydrosalpinx is another type of adnexal mass that is associated with infertility.

This prevents the formation of new physiologic ovarian cysts. Oral contraceptives (OCs) do not decrease the size of existing cysts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-an-adnexal-mass/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Numerous studies have investigated the effects of OCs on follicular cyst development and ovulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-an-adnexal-mass/abstract/27-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-34</a>]. In general, current OCs with a dose of &le;35 mcg ethinyl estradiol resulted in the development of fewer follicular cysts, but to a lesser extent than higher dose formulations (50 mcg ethinyl estradiol). There was no difference in the suppression of cyst development between monophasic and multiphasic OCs. </p><p>The typical regimen is an OC once daily; this can be continued for as long as the patient desires to remain on an OC. Other types of estrogen-progestin contraceptives (eg, patch, ring) have not been studied for this indication, but are likely to have the same effect. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15995958\"><span class=\"h2\">Pregnant women</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ovarian or other adnexal masses in pregnant women are managed by the same principles as in other patients, although the choice of treatment depends upon issues of maternal and fetal safety.</p><p>The evaluation and management of adnexal masses in pregnant women is discussed in detail separately.

The management of an adnexal mass depends upon the type of mass, urgency of the presentation, and degree of suspicion that the mass is malignant. (See <a href=\"#H25411714\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excluding malignancy is a principal goal of the evaluation of an adnexal mass. The most important factor used to determine the clinical suspicion of malignancy of an adnexal mass is the sonographic appearance of the mass. Other factors, such as menopausal status, an elevated tumor marker, symptoms, or risk factors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F59585\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59585 \">table 3</a>) may add to the degree of suspicion.
