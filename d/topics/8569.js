There are several important issues that must be considered when hypothyroidism occurs during pregnancy or when women with preexisting treated hypothyroidism become pregnant.

Symptoms may be overlooked or attributed to the pregnancy itself as some of the symptoms of hypothyroidism are similar to those of pregnancy (although cold intolerance is not a normal clinical manifestation of pregnancy). Many patients are asymptomatic.

These changes include an increase in thyroxine (T4)-binding globulin (TBG), which results in total T4 and triiodothyronine (T3) concentrations that are higher than in nonpregnant women. In addition, high serum human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) levels, particularly during early pregnancy, result in a reduction in first trimester serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentrations.

Symptoms may be overlooked or attributed to the pregnancy itself. Many patients are asymptomatic. Hypothyroidism can have additional adverse effects on the mother and child, depending upon the biochemical severity of the hypothyroidism. (See <a href=\"#H57693617\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above and <a href=\"#H821274\" class=\"local\">'Pregnancy complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of overt primary hypothyroidism during pregnancy is based upon the finding of an elevated population and trimester-specific thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) concentration (or above 4.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L</span> when local reference range is not available) in conjunction with a decreased free thyroxine (T4) concentration (below assay normal using reference range for pregnant women). Subclinical hypothyroidism is defined as an elevated population and trimester-specific serum TSH concentration and a normal free T4 concentration. (See <a href=\"#H4181675356\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The universal screening of asymptomatic pregnant women for thyroid dysfunction during the first trimester of pregnancy is controversial. We suggest a targeted approach (case finding) rather than universal screening (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We favor screening pregnant women if they are from an area of moderate to severe iodine insufficiency; have symptoms of hypothyroidism; have a family or personal history of thyroid disease or have a personal history of goiter, thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibodies, type 1 diabetes or other autoimmune disorder, head and neck radiation, recurrent miscarriage or preterm delivery, morbid obesity, infertility, multiple prior pregnancies (&gt;2), use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a>, or recent iodinated radiocontrast; or age &gt;30 years. (See <a href=\"#H688953868\" class=\"local\">'Whom to screen'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In women who meet the case-finding criteria, we measure serum TSH during the first trimester as the screening test for hypothyroidism. If the serum TSH is above 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L,</span> we also measure TPO antibodies, and if the TSH is above the population and trimester-specific upper limit of normal (or &gt;4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L</span> if local reference range is not available), we measure free T4 to determine the degree of hypothyroidism. (See <a href=\"#H849839672\" class=\"local\">'Approach to screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In women with normal TSH at initial screening but at particularly high risk for developing hypothyroidism during pregnancy (TPO antibody positive, post-radioiodine treatment, post-hemithyroidectomy, history of childhood exposure to high-dose irradiation of the head or neck region), we reassess TSH during pregnancy (eg, approximately every four weeks during the first trimester, and then once during each of the second and third trimesters). (See <a href=\"#H849839672\" class=\"local\">'Approach to screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All pregnant women with newly diagnosed, overt hypothyroidism (TSH above population and trimester-specific normal reference range [or above 4.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L</span> when local reference range is not available] with low free T4) should be treated with thyroid hormone (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=levothyroxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levothyroxine</a>, T4). In addition, we suggest initiating T4 replacement in pregnant women with subclinical hypothyroidism (TSH above population and trimester-specific normal reference range [or above 4.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L]</span> with normal free T4) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F113037\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef113037 \">algorithm 1</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H57693666\" class=\"local\">'Indications for treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"#H57693631\" class=\"local\">'Subclinical hypothyroidism'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients with overt hypothyroidism should be started on close to full replacement doses (1.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> body weight per day), while patients with subclinical hypothyroidism may become euthyroid with lower doses and can therefore be started on approximately 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> daily. TSH should be measured every four weeks during the first half of pregnancy because dose adjustments are often required. The goal of treatment is to maintain TSH in the lower half of the trimester-specific reference range (or approximately &lt;2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L)</span>. (See <a href=\"#H57693673\" class=\"local\">'Levothyroxine initial dosing'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4176819886\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring and dose adjustments'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An increased rate of fetal loss and premature delivery has been reported in women with high serum anti-TPO antibody concentrations, and adverse outcomes occur at a lower TSH than in women without TPO antibodies. For pregnant women with a TSH between 2.6 and 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L,</span> positive TPO antibodies, and a history of recurrent miscarriage, we suggest treatment with T4 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F113037\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef113037 \">algorithm 1</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>), typically 50 mcg daily. For pregnant women with TSH in this range and no prior history of miscarriage, we individualize the decision to treat based upon the presence of TPO antibodies and patient values and preferences. (See <a href=\"#H57693666\" class=\"local\">'Indications for treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-thyroid-disease-in-pregnancy#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of thyroid disease in pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Thyroid peroxidase antibodies in euthyroid women'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-couples-with-recurrent-pregnancy-loss#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of couples with recurrent pregnancy loss&quot;, section on 'Thyroid dysfunction and diabetes mellitus'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women with preexisting hypothyroidism who are planning to become pregnant should optimize their thyroid hormone dose preconception. The goal preconception serum TSH level is between the lower reference limit and 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L</span>. If possible, women already taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levothyroxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levothyroxine</a> should have a normal serum TSH (ie, &lt;2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/L)</span> prior to becoming pregnant. (See <a href=\"#H1896548241\" class=\"local\">'Goal preconception TSH'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>T4 dose requirements may increase during pregnancy in women with preexisting overt or subclinical hypothyroidism. For treated hypothyroid women who are newly pregnant, we suggest preemptively increasing their <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levothyroxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levothyroxine</a> dose at the time of the positive pregnancy test (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). We typically accomplish this by increasing the dose from once-daily dosing to a total of nine doses per week (double the daily dose two days each week). (See <a href=\"#H57693680\" class=\"local\">'Preexisting hypothyroidism'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">An alternative to preemptively increasing the dose is to measure serum TSH as soon as pregnancy is confirmed, then again four weeks later, four weeks after any change in the dose of T4, and at least once each trimester. The dose should be adjusted as needed every four weeks to achieve a normal TSH level, using a trimester-specific reference range.
