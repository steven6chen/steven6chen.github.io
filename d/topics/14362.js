Following resuscitation and stabilization, management of the burn wounds becomes the next priority. The later effects of burns, which are related to loss of normal tissue and scarring, include limitation of movement, pain, disfigurement, and social embarrassment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-extremities-and-regional-nodal-basins/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The principles of burn reconstruction of the upper and lower extremities, including the axilla and inguinal lymph node basins, are reviewed here.

The presence of circumferential burns, deep-patterned burns, and, potentially, acute compartment syndrome should be assessed and escharotomy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F86905\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86905 \">picture 1</a>) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fasciotomy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F70951\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70951 \">figure 1</a>) performed in a timely fashion, as needed.

Burns to the upper extremity cause deformities following scar contracture and limit function, thus affecting all activities of daily living. They also greatly disrupt the cosmetic appearance of normal upper limb anatomy. This is particularly damaging when the fine movements of the hand are affected. Numerous methods have been described to release dynamic (early-phase) and static (late-phase) complex scar contracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-extremities-and-regional-nodal-basins/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Scars cause tendon adhesions, contractures, deep adipose tissue stiffness, and limitation of major joint range of motion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-extremities-and-regional-nodal-basins/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Free flap reconstruction offers the advantages of early mobilization of the upper extremity, excellent functional results, and less concern about limited donor skin availability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-extremities-and-regional-nodal-basins/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Local and regional flaps based on random or recognized vascular pedicles are also used. If not available, the most common procedure to release scar contractures and reconstruct burned upper extremities is scar excision and coverage with split-thickness skin grafts (STSGs) with or without combination with dermal substitutes or dermal regeneration templates, or full-thickness skin grafts (FTSGs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-extremities-and-regional-nodal-basins/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. There are many disadvantages with skin grafts, the most important of which include a recurrence of the contracture, prolonged immobilization, and possible limitations on donor tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-extremities-and-regional-nodal-basins/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17954508\"><span class=\"h2\">Axilla</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reconstruction of the axillary contractures is performed to restore full shoulder joint mobility once scar maturation is complete and after physical therapy options have been exhausted. Low-grade contractures can usually be managed with range of motion exercises, splint fixation, and pressure treatment with garments and silicone gel sheets. For severe contractures that limit range of motion, these conservative measures are not effective.</p><p>Five general types and subtypes of axillary contractures have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-extremities-and-regional-nodal-basins/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type I: Small, thin flat contractures, adipose layer is conserved</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type IIa: Band contracture of the anterior axillary line</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type IIb: Band contracture of the posterior axillary line</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type IIIa: Contractures on both the anterior and posterior line with no contractures between the lines</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type IIIb: Contractures on both the anterior and posterior line with contractures between the lines</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type IVa: Contractures extending to both the chest and upper arm with no contractures on the back</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type IVb: Contractures extending to both the back and upper arm with no contractures on the chest</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type IVc: Contractures extending to the both chest and back with no contractures on the upper arm</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type V: Extensive contractures greater than Type IV</p><p/><p>The reconstruction procedure selected should be based on the type of contracture to be released and the size, depth, location, and shape of the area to be covered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-extremities-and-regional-nodal-basins/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Reconstruction should be performed with pliable, unburned tissue, if possible, to reduce the risk of recurrence of contractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-extremities-and-regional-nodal-basins/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. An algorithm is provided to identify the optimal surgical reconstructive procedure based on the severity and limitations of the burn wound (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F73863\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73863 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Reconstruction options include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-extremities-and-regional-nodal-basins/abstract/6,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Split-thickness or full-thickness skin grafting with or without combination with dermal substitutes and dermal regeneration templates</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Z-plasty and related alphanumeric advancement and transposition flaps</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Local tissue flap transfers</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regional tissue flap transfers, including perforator flaps and island flaps</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Free microvascular flap transfers</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any combination of flaps and grafts</p><p/><p>Split-thickness skin grafts are reserved for the repair of minor contractions or in instances when no other reconstructive option exists. The lack of pliability of skin grafts results in secondary contractures and limitations of mobility in the axilla. Local and regional flaps either by advance or transposition and free flaps are preferred for reconstructing severe axillary contractures and areas that require large amount of tissue coverage.

The next best option includes the use of full-thickness grafts. However, a large defect is created when axillary contractures are released, and availability of unburned full-thickness skin may be insufficient to cover the large defects in the axilla.</p><p>Limited axillary contractures can be satisfactorily managed with the use of the Z-plasty advancement flap or any variations such as the Y-V-plasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-extremities-and-regional-nodal-basins/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The indications for using a Z-plasty for release of contractures include (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=z-plasty\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Z-plasty&quot;</a>): </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increasing scar length</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transforming a straight line scar into a less obvious irregular line</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Realigning a scar to minimize contour deformity</p><p/><p>The degree of elongation of the scar that can be achieved depends on the angle of the transposing flaps. For every 15 degrees of increase in the angle of the transposing flaps, a theoretical 25 percent in elongation can be achieved. For example:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 30&deg; angle achieves 25 percent elongation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 45&deg; angle achieves 50 percent elongation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 60&deg; angle achieves 75 percent elongation</p><p/><p>The limitations of the use of the Z-plasty in burn scar revision are related to this theoretic increase in elongation. The percent of elongation is dependent upon the elasticity of the tissues and the wound closure tension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-extremities-and-regional-nodal-basins/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Unburned surrounding skin and pliable tissues provide for the greatest likelihood of a successful flap transposition without risk of flap tissue loss.</p><p>The indications and limitations of the V-Y-plasty are similar to those of the Z-plasty for burn scar reconstruction; however, the success of the V-Y-plasty is more dependent upon the need for unburned surrounding skin. A double reverse V-Y-plasty has been successfully used to restore axillary function when skin tension across the contracture is too great for a local flap and when superficial scarring is localized in the contracture site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-extremities-and-regional-nodal-basins/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. While necrosis is a risk of flap procedures, there was no distal flap necrosis in 19 burn patients treated with this procedure. </p><p>Additional options for release of axillary scar bands include the alphanumeric transposition flaps (eg, five-flap plasty, seven-flap plasty) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-extremities-and-regional-nodal-basins/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>] or a combination of circular excision combined with Z-plasty reorientation of the scar for resolution of large axillary contractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-extremities-and-regional-nodal-basins/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. A prospective trial found that the seven-flap interdigitating plasty's immediate postoperative percentage mean length gained in the axilla was 103 percent (n = 14) and compared favorably to an average of 121 percent for all other anatomic regions evaluated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-extremities-and-regional-nodal-basins/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p>Local flaps from adjacent tissues are used to treat mild scar contractures and resurface release defects in the axilla and antecubital fossa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-extremities-and-regional-nodal-basins/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Providing that healthy skin is available, subcutaneous pedicled flaps can be used to restore function and improve aesthetics. The tissues adjacent to the axilla provide a rich vascular network to allow regional fasciocutaneous flap options based on pedicles such as the circumflex scapular artery for a bilobed flap [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-extremities-and-regional-nodal-basins/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], intercostal perforator options [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-extremities-and-regional-nodal-basins/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], or options based on ad-hoc or unnamed perforators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-extremities-and-regional-nodal-basins/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>In a review of seven children with burn contractures of the axilla, functional release was achieved in all patients using a local flap (n = 4), Integra dermal regeneration template (n = 2), or an anterolateral free flap from the thigh (n = 1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-extremities-and-regional-nodal-basins/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Excellent results as measured by restoration of 75 to 100 percent of range of motion were reported for <span class=\"nowrap\">3/4</span> local flaps, <span class=\"nowrap\">1/2</span> Integra templates, and the free flap reconstruction. Integra was used when local tissue was not available for reconstruction (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topical-agents-and-dressings-for-local-burn-wound-care#H21594043\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Topical agents and dressings for local burn wound care&quot;, section on 'Semibiologic skin substitutes'</a>). An innovative technique, the free medial thigh perforator flap, was used to reconstruct the burned and scarred axilla in three adults with no complications or recurrence of the contracture at 12 months following surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-extremities-and-regional-nodal-basins/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17954393\"><span class=\"h2\">Antecubital fossa and elbow</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antecubital fossa burn scars are a complicated challenge, and release of the contractures results in a secondary defect that requires tissue coverage. The principles of reconstruction of burn scar deformities in the antecubital fossa and elbow are to restore normal anatomy and function, eliminate flexion deformities, and preserve cosmesis. Reconstruction is performed after the scars are mature and conservative measures such as physical therapy, occupational therapy, and splinting have been exhausted. If the deformity is severe, early surgical intervention can preserve function. A 50 percent reduction of the range of motion of the elbow can reduce the function of the upper extremity by approximately 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-extremities-and-regional-nodal-basins/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

There were seven expanders inserted into the lower extremity, four were infected including one partially extruded, and two were subsequently removed. There is insufficient evidence to support the use of tissue expanders in burned lower extremities.

Pedicled flaps used in this study included lateral supramalleolar, medial plantar, and soleus flaps. The latissimus myocutaneous flap was used as the free flap in this study for the distal leg, and a medial plantar flap or the lateral malleolus flaps were used to reconstruct the heel.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17954436\"><span class=\"h2\">Ankle</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The thinness of the skin and the limited available local tissue near the malleolar areas of the ankle are a challenge for burn reconstruction. Hypertrophic scar formation that results in contractures of the ankle or foot impairs ambulation. Reconstruction procedures are performed to improve function and ambulation. There are no high-quality data from prospective trials that have identified optimal reconstruction of the ankle or foot following a burn injury.</p><p>A simple scar contracture without exposure of the underlying structures is managed by realignment, incision, excision, skin grafting, or local flap coverage plus splinting. Perforator flaps and free flaps are options for complex burn scars, as skin grafts cannot be used to cover exposed tendons, bones, or joints. Joint realignment procedures may be needed in cases of fourth-degree burns.

This deformity may be corrected by proper splinting and physical therapy; however, surgical intervention for scar contracture release and reconstruction of periarticular structures may become necessary in refractory cases. Capsulotomy and tendon transfers may also be performed to correct this deformity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-extremities-and-regional-nodal-basins/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].</p><p>Pedicled tissue transfer and microvascular free flaps have been used in complex cases of burn scars and trauma. A distally based lateral supramalleolar adipofascial flap has been used in seven trauma patients for reconstruction of the dorsum of the foot and ankle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-extremities-and-regional-nodal-basins/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. The flap is versatile, thin, and can be used for both the foot and ankle.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2413554\"><span class=\"h3\">Achilles tendon</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Achilles tendon is in a superficial location and vulnerable to injury by a deep burn. The paratenon is immediately beneath the subcutaneous tissue and frequently damaged in a severe burn; hence, skin grafts are not an option for coverage of an exposed tendon. Scar contractures can lead to a pes equinus deformity (toes extremely flexed) and ambulatory disabilities. An exposed Achilles tendon may be reconstructed with free flaps (eg, anteromedial thigh fasciocutaneous flap with a vascularized iliotibial band) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-extremities-and-regional-nodal-basins/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>], negative pressure wound therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-extremities-and-regional-nodal-basins/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>], or an island adipofascial flap covered by a split-thickness skin graft [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-extremities-and-regional-nodal-basins/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. </p><p>Long-term follow-up at three years revealed almost complete normal range of motion for the patient treated with the anteromedial thigh fasciocutaneous flap [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-extremities-and-regional-nodal-basins/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. In a review of 10 patients with an exposed Achilles tendon after trauma or burn, the island adipofascial flap was viable in all patients, there was no functional deficit of the Achilles tendon, and a good cosmetic appearance was reported for all patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-extremities-and-regional-nodal-basins/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25050360\"><span class=\"h2\">Foot and toes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dorsal and plantar contractures require splinting to maintain position and may require bone corrective surgery if joints have been permanently damaged. Incision and excision techniques with grafting are usually enough to provide adequate coverage for reconstruction. Because of the unique anatomy and function of the plantar surface of the foot, any full-thickness reconstruction will not be able to preserve the inherent resilience of the foot to trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-extremities-and-regional-nodal-basins/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. The key element to reconstruction is the preservation of foot function (eg, ambulation and weightbearing) by providing restoration of anatomy with avoidance of secondary deformities due to tendon or joint contracture. Adequate splintage preserves reconstruction integrity until adequate healing is achieved.</p><p>As described in the section on ankle and tibia burns, simple scars can be treated with realignment, incision, excision, and skin grafting. Flaps, including pedicled, perforator, and free flaps, are reserved for complex situations. (See <a href=\"#H2412747\" class=\"local\">'Tibia'</a> above and <a href=\"#H17954436\" class=\"local\">'Ankle'</a> above.) </p><p>When deep burns occur on the plantar surface of the feet and toes, plantar flexion and claw toes deformities are the most common complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-extremities-and-regional-nodal-basins/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].

The non-weight-bearing surface of the instep can be reconstructed with a FTSG or STSG and a dermal regeneration template. The weight-bearing surfaces are reconstructed using sensate and mechanically durable tissue. Flaps that lack sensation are more likely to be damaged because of lack of deep pressure sensation and unfavorable weight distribution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-extremities-and-regional-nodal-basins/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. </p><p>Musculofascial flaps based on the dorsalis pedis arterial system, such as the reversed dorsalis pedis flap, can be used to resurface the distal foot and great toe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-burn-reconstruction-extremities-and-regional-nodal-basins/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].

Reconstruction options include split-thickness grafts together with dermal regeneration templates to increase pliability, full-thickness skin grafts, Z-plasty-type realignments, advancement flaps, free microvascular flaps, and rotation or transposition flaps.
