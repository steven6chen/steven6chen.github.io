Zika virus is transmitted to humans via the bite of an infected Aedes mosquito. This type of mosquito usually bites during the daytime and breeds in standing water (particularly manmade containers). (See <a href=\"#H3898839592\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical manifestations of Zika virus infection include acute onset of low-grade fever with maculopapular pruritic rash, arthralgia (notably in the small joints of the hands and feet), or conjunctivitis (nonpurulent); clinical illness is consistent with Zika virus disease if two or more of these symptoms are present. Zika virus infection has also been associated with congenital microcephaly, fetal loss, and Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H937096741\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incubation period between mosquito bite and onset of clinical manifestations is typically 2 to 14 days. The illness is usually mild; clinical manifestations usually resolve within two to seven days. Asymptomatic infection is common; symptoms develop in 20 to 25 percent of individuals who become infected with Zika virus. Once a person has been infected, he or she is likely to be protected from future infections. (See <a href=\"#H1220327707\" class=\"local\">'Symptoms and signs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of Zika virus infection should be suspected in individuals with typical clinical manifestations and relevant epidemiologic exposure (residence in or travel to an area where mosquito-borne transmission of Zika virus infection has been reported, or unprotected sexual contact with a person who meets these criteria). (See <a href=\"#H4142744963\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of Zika virus infection is established via real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) testing for Zika viral RNA (in serum, urine, or whole blood) or serology. The approach to diagnostic testing depends on the timing of presentation after onset of symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H4142744963\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no specific treatment for Zika virus infection and there is no vaccine for prevention. Management consists of symptomatic treatment. Preventive measures include personal protective measures to prevent mosquito bites and institution of measures to eliminate and control mosquito breeding sites. (See <a href=\"#H807131950\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1580412137\" class=\"local\">'Mosquito protection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sexual transmission of Zika virus has been described. In all areas, men or women with Zika virus infection or exposure (via travel to mosquito transmission areas or sexual contact) who have a pregnant partner should abstain from unprotected sex for the duration of the pregnancy. Within areas of Zika virus mosquito transmission, it is prudent for individuals to abstain from sexual activity (vaginal, anal, and oral sex) or use barrier protection while active transmission persists. (See <a href=\"#H3203192019\" class=\"local\">'Sexual transmission'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Outside areas of Zika virus mosquito transmission, guidance for couples where one or both partners have Zika virus infection or exposure include the following (see <a href=\"#H3203192019\" class=\"local\">'Sexual transmission'</a> above): </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Men (whether symptomatic or not) should wait at least six months after symptom onset (if symptomatic) or last possible Zika virus exposure (if asymptomatic) before unprotected sex.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Women (whether symptomatic or not) should wait at least eight weeks after symptom onset (if symptomatic) or last possible Zika virus exposure (if asymptomatic) before unprotected sex.</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/zika-virus-infection-an-overview/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Petersen LR, Jamieson DJ, Powers AM, Honein MA.
