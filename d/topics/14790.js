These tests are performed alone or in combination for the detection, diagnosis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the evaluation of multiple conditions.

Since obstruction is a readily reversible disorder, <strong>all</strong> patients presenting with renal failure of unknown etiology should undergo ultrasonography, the modality of choice to detect possible obstructive disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-urinary-tract-obstruction-and-hydronephrosis#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of urinary tract obstruction and hydronephrosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>The following is a brief introduction to the use of radiologic studies in the evaluation of patients with a variety of suspected or confirmed renal disorders. Detailed discussions concerning the findings and optimal use of these modalities, as well as other techniques, are presented separately in topics reviewing individual diseases for which these modalities are routinely employed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">RADIOLOGIC STUDIES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Ultrasonography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Renal ultrasonography is the test of choice to exclude urinary tract obstruction since it allows one to avoid the potential allergic and toxic complications of radiocontrast media (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F94099\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef94099 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F94100\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef94100 \">image 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiologic-assessment-of-renal-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Ultrasound can, in the majority of affected patients, diagnose hydronephrosis and often establish its cause. Since urinary tract obstruction is easily diagnosed and reversible when treated early, ultrasonography should be performed in <strong>all</strong> patients presenting with renal failure of unknown etiology. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-urinary-tract-obstruction-and-hydronephrosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of urinary tract obstruction and hydronephrosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>While ultrasound is useful for detecting proximal obstruction of the ureter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F94101\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef94101 \">image 3</a>), it is less sensitive for showing the level and cause of obstruction when obstruction is in the lower abdomen or pelvis, especially when the ureter is obscured by overlying bowel. One exception is when a stone is impacted at the ureterovesical junction; when this is suspected, a pelvic ultrasound examination may be useful. The bladder should be examined in all cases of hydronephrosis, whether or not the proximal ureter is dilated.</p><p>Although less sensitive than computed tomography (CT) in initially detecting a renal mass, ultrasonography can be useful in differentiating a simple, benign renal cyst from a more complex cyst or a solid tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiologic-assessment-of-renal-disease/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=simple-and-complex-renal-cysts-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Simple and complex renal cysts in adults&quot;</a>). It is also commonly used to screen for and diagnose polycystic kidney disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-and-screening-for-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of and screening for autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease&quot;, section on 'Ultrasonographic criteria for adults'</a>.)</p><p>Ultrasonography or CT scanning should also be considered in patients with pyelonephritis who continue to have an incomplete response to antimicrobial therapy. These techniques can rule out the presence of obstruction, renal or perinephric abscesses, and other complications of pyelonephritis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F62046\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef62046 \">image 4</a>). CT scanning with contrast may be required to identify abscesses. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-complicated-urinary-tract-infection-including-pyelonephritis-in-adults#H3170583666\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute complicated urinary tract infection (including pyelonephritis) in adults&quot;, section on 'Imaging'</a>.)</p><p>Findings on ultrasonography are also frequently utilized to assess the presence of irreversible kidney disease, based upon kidney size and cortical thickness. Increased echogenicity is a nonspecific finding seen with many diffuse renal diseases that does <strong>not</strong> necessarily indicate irreversible disease. In contrast, the combination of increased echogenicity and kidney length &lt;10 cm almost always indicates untreatable disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiologic-assessment-of-renal-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Although the resistive index is often used as a marker of renal parenchymal disease, it is a nonspecific parameter. However, it can be useful in the evaluation of renal artery stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiologic-assessment-of-renal-disease/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Ultrasound is also useful in diagnosing nephrocalcinosis, which can be caused by various etiologies like medullary cystic disease, renal tubular acidosis, and hyperparathyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiologic-assessment-of-renal-disease/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]; however, it cannot be used to reliably exclude the presence of small, nonobstructing stones.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Doppler ultrasonography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doppler ultrasonography can be used to evaluate renal vascular flow in multiple disorders. These include evaluation of renal<em> </em>artery stenosis, renal vein thrombosis, and renal infarction. However, CT and magnetic resonance (MR) are more sensitive for these conditions and are usually required for confirmation. Doppler ultrasonography to screen for renal artery stenosis is a technically challenging study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiologic-assessment-of-renal-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>] and is only reliable in high-volume centers when performed and interpreted by experienced radiologists. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=establishing-the-diagnosis-of-renovascular-hypertension#H16699492\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Establishing the diagnosis of renovascular hypertension&quot;, section on 'Duplex Doppler ultrasonography'</a>.)</p><p>Doppler ultrasonography is also used to obtain the renal resistive index, which is calculated from the following formula:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; (Peak systolic velocity - end diastolic velocity) &divide; Peak systolic velocity<br/> &#160; </p></div></div><p>The normal renal resistive index is &lt;0.7. A high renal resistive index can be observed in a wide variety of disorders and is dependent primarily on extrarenal hemodynamics rather than intrarenal factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiologic-assessment-of-renal-disease/abstract/5,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,10</a>]. As a result, the renal resistive index is of <strong>no</strong> utility in the diagnosis of renal parenchymal disease. Resistive index is commonly measured in transplanted kidneys but is an insensitive and nonspecific indicator of rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiologic-assessment-of-renal-disease/abstract/6,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11,12</a>]. While the resistive index has prognostic value, this is probably related to systemic factors rather than renal abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiologic-assessment-of-renal-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Computed tomography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CT often provides complementary information to that obtained with renal ultrasonography. In particular, CT with contrast is used to evaluate complex renal cysts and possible masses detected by ultrasonography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiologic-assessment-of-renal-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Conversely, renal ultrasonography can often clarify whether indeterminant masses on CT scanning are cystic. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=simple-and-complex-renal-cysts-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Simple and complex renal cysts in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are several other indications for CT in patients with renal disease:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Noncontrast low-radiation dose CT scan is the gold standard for the radiologic diagnosis of renal stone disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F69052%7ERADIOL%2F72669\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef69052 graphicRef72669 \">image 5A-B</a>), including the detection of small stones or ureteral stones not detectable by ultrasound or stones not visualized on plain films of the abdomen, and is the appropriate initial imaging test for suspected renal colic.

However, the administration of gadolinium during MRI was strongly linked to an often severe disease called nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) among patients with reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), particularly those requiring dialysis. As a result, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended that gadolinium-based imaging be avoided, if possible, in patients with an eGFR &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>. However, the risk of NSF varies considerably among the different gadolinium compounds and may be minimal with some, so prior consultation with the radiologist is advised. The use of gadolinium in patients with reduced renal function is discussed at length elsewhere.

(See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Computed tomography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the kidneys is performed in a variety of clinical settings, including suspected renovascular hypertension, renal vein thrombosis, and in the evaluation of renal masses, including suspected or confirmed renal cell carcinoma. However, the administration of gadolinium during MRI has been linked to nephrogenic systemic fibrosis (NSF) among patients with reduced estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), particularly those requiring dialysis. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Magnetic resonance imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A plain film of the abdomen is not commonly performed as the first study in patients with suspected renal disease, although it can identify calcium-containing, struvite, and cystine kidney stones of sufficient size (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F62009\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef62009 \">image 6</a>). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Abdominal radiography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Renal arteriography is used less frequently because of the availability of noninvasive tests such as CT scanning and MRI. However, it remains useful in certain settings, such as patients with suspected polyarteritis nodosa, since it can demonstrate aneurysms and irregular constrictions in the larger vessels with occlusion of smaller penetrating arteries (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F65987\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef65987 \">image 7</a>). (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Renal arteriography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radionuclide scanning provides functional data and can determine the function of each kidney. Early detection of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) and scarring is possible with radioisotope scanning with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=technetium-tc-99m-succimer-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">technetium Tc-99m succimer</a> (DMSA) and a voiding cystourethrogram. DMSA scanning is more sensitive than intravenous urography in detecting renal scars and is the preferred test for many pediatric nephrologists and radiologists. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Radionuclide studies'</a> above and <a href=\"#H22680100\" class=\"local\">'Voiding cystourethrography'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/radiologic-assessment-of-renal-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Webb JA.
