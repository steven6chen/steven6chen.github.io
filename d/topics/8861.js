The improved survival has been attributed to a number of factors including new and more conservative use of immunosuppressive agents, improved diagnostic methods for identifying and preventing infections, and better surgical techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The specific factors (preoperative and postoperative) that increase the risk for infection in liver transplant patients will be reviewed here. The most common pathogens responsible for infection at three key time points (the first month after transplant, months 1 through 6, and after the initial six months) will also be discussed. Other issues related to liver transplantation and infections in solid organ transplant recipients are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infection-in-the-solid-organ-transplant-recipient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infection in the solid organ transplant recipient&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-for-infection-before-solid-organ-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation for infection before solid organ transplantation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prophylaxis-of-infections-in-solid-organ-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prophylaxis of infections in solid organ transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite advances in liver transplantation, morbidity and mortality due to infectious complications remain major problems. In many centers, infection is the most frequent cause of death following liver transplantation even though deaths related to infectious diseases in non-transplant settings have steadily decreased. In an autopsy series, for example, infections were the cause of death in 64 percent of 321 transplant patients who died between 1982 and 1997 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The most common types of infection were bacterial (48 percent), fungal (22 percent), and viral (12 percent). In another report, up to two-thirds of all liver transplant patients had at least one episode of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Other series have observed infection rates of 1 to 2.5 episodes per patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. Infection is the most common cause of fever in liver transplant recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several principles of infection in solid organ transplant recipients are important to recognize [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Signs and symptoms of infection are often attenuated in the setting of immunosuppression, and infection may be more difficult to diagnose.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Noninfectious causes of fever may mimic infection (eg, allograft rejection, medications).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The variety of possible pathogens is quite broad but is influenced by the timing of infection in relation to transplantation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antimicrobial agents used to treat infections can have important drug interactions with immunosuppressive medications.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection may be more severe and progress more rapidly compared with immunocompetent hosts.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection risk is determined by a patient's &quot;net state of immunosuppression&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], a balance contributed to by factors such as the dose, type, and duration of immunosuppressive therapy, the presence of indwelling devices such as catheters, nutritional status, metabolic conditions, certain immunomodulating viral infections, graft function, and underlying diseases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infection-in-the-solid-organ-transplant-recipient#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infection in the solid organ transplant recipient&quot;, section on 'Net state of immunosuppression'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Identification of risk factors for infection before transplantation permits the optimal use of strategies for preventing infections in the posttransplant setting. Although the ability to accurately predict a patient's risk of infection after transplantation remains limited, there are some risk factors that can be modified when recognized, such as the cytomegalovirus (CMV) serostatus of the transplant donor and recipient. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Herpesviruses'</a> below.)</p><p>One important risk factor is the presence of a latent or unrecognized infection in either the transplant donor or recipient. Such infections may reactivate and cause significant morbidity after the introduction of immunosuppressive therapy. As a result, potential transplant donors and recipients are routinely screened for infections such as those due to CMV and other herpesviruses, tuberculosis, hepatitis B and C, syphilis, and human immunodeficiency virus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F59792\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59792 \">table 1</a>). This is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-for-infection-before-solid-organ-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation for infection before solid organ transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Infection in the donor that is active at the time of organ procurement may also be transferred to the recipient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. For example, bacteremic donors have transmitted bloodstream infection to transplant recipients despite administration of appropriate antimicrobial prophylaxis, and liver transplant recipients may be at increased risk for donor-derived bacteremias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infection-in-the-solid-organ-transplant-recipient#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infection in the solid organ transplant recipient&quot;, section on 'Donor-derived infections'</a>.)</p><p>Pretransplant colonization of liver transplant recipients with organisms such as methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (MRSA) or vancomycin-resistant <em>Enterococcus</em> (VRE) can lead to posttransplant infection with these organisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. However, MRSA and VRE colonization are not contraindications to transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. An increased prevalence of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli (eg, extended-spectrum beta-lactamase&ndash;producing Enterobacteriaceae, including <em>Escherichia coli</em> and <em>Klebsiella pneumoniae</em>; carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae) has been observed not only in the general population but also in solid organ transplant recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Transplant recipients often have several risk factors for acquisition of resistant bacteria, such as prior antimicrobials, devices, exposure to the healthcare environment, and underlying illness.</p><p>Various other risk factors for infection after liver transplantation have been reported. Many are related to surgical complications of the transplant operation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. As an example, in a series of 101 patients, risk factors for infection included a prolonged operative time (&gt;12 hours) and reoperation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Two pretransplant variables were predictive of infection; a serum alanine aminotransferase concentration above 60 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/L</span> was associated with an increased risk of all types of infection, and a T <span class=\"nowrap\">helper/suppressor</span> ratio &le;2.8 was associated with an increased risk of viral and fungal infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>In other reports, the risk of bacterial infections was increased in patients who had undergone Roux-en-Y biliary anastomosis rather than choledochocholedochostomy, had multiple abdominal surgeries, or had CMV infection in the postoperative period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/3,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,17</a>]. Similar risk factors have been identified for posttransplant fungal infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/3,18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,18-20</a>]. Graft dysfunction and preexisting critical illness also confer an increased risk for posttransplant infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>CMV infection increases the risk of other infections, which may in part be due to the immunomodulatory effects of this virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/3,8,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8,17</a>]. Patients who develop rejection or who have poor graft function after transplant are also at increased risk of infection, at least in part because they receive a more aggressive immunosuppressive regimen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to screening potential liver donors and recipients for infection as noted above, there are some general approaches to the prevention of infections in liver transplant patients. These include vaccination, the universal administration of prophylactic antimicrobials to patients at increased risk for specific infections (both perioperative surgical prophylaxis and posttransplant prophylaxis), and preemptive therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. &quot;Targeted prophylaxis&quot; and &quot;educated avoidance&quot; are additional approaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Preventive strategies are discussed in further detail below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Vaccination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients awaiting liver transplantation should receive appropriate vaccinations before transplantation since antirejection immunosuppressive medications may prevent optimal responses to vaccination post-transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Although efficacy is decreased after transplantation, particularly in the first few months after transplant or during other periods of intensified immunosuppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], certain vaccines such as pneumococcal and influenza vaccines should be repeated after transplantation in an attempt to lower the risk for these diseases. As a general rule, live vaccines should be avoided in transplant recipients due to the risk of disseminated disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunizations-in-solid-organ-transplant-candidates-and-recipients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunizations in solid organ transplant candidates and recipients&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunizations-for-patients-with-chronic-liver-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunizations for patients with chronic liver disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Antibacterial and PCP prophylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rate of surgical site infection (SSI) is higher in liver transplant recipients compared with other solid organ transplant types and can cause considerable morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Antibiotics are administered at transplantation in an attempt to prevent SSIs, including wound and intraabdominal infection, although they do not provide complete protection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Skin and intestinal flora are common SSI pathogens, and it is important to recognize local epidemiologic patterns and recent colonizing or infecting organisms in the transplant recipient and donor when choosing antibiotics for prophylaxis. The use of antibacterial agents around the time of transplantation is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prophylaxis-of-infections-in-solid-organ-transplantation#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prophylaxis of infections in solid organ transplantation&quot;, section on 'Antibacterial prophylaxis'</a>.)</p><p>In patients without sulfonamide allergy, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> is generally administered for 6 to 12 months after liver transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], primarily to reduce the risk of <em>Pneumocystis jirovecii</em> (formerly <em>P. carinii</em>) pneumonia (PCP), but it also helps to prevent infections with <em>Listeria monocytogenes</em>, <em>Nocardia asteroides</em>, <em>Toxoplasma gondii</em>, and many common urinary, respiratory, and gastrointestinal bacterial pathogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/8,25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,25-27</a>]. One single-strength tablet is taken daily or one double-strength tablet is taken three times weekly. Routine use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis has virtually eliminated PCP infection in the posttransplant setting in comparison with a 10 to 12 percent incidence in earlier series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-pneumocystis-pneumonia-in-hiv-uninfected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of Pneumocystis pneumonia in HIV-uninfected patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In patients who are intolerant of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a>, second-line PCP prophylaxis agents can be used, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dapsone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dapsone</a>, aerosolized <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentamidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pentamidine</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atovaquone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atovaquone</a>. However, these medications do not provide the broad-spectrum activity that trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole does against pathogens other than PCP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>The most common adverse effect of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> is allergy. Myelosuppression can also occur, but it is uncommon at the doses used for prophylaxis. Oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in combination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> can affect tubular secretion of creatinine and increase serum creatinine levels without necessarily decreasing renal function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In higher doses (such as those needed to treat PCP), it can also exacerbate the nephrotoxicity of cyclosporine or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Herpesviruses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cytomegalovirus (CMV) remains the most important viral infection in liver transplant recipients. CMV infection, the presence of the virus in blood, tissue, or body fluids, should be distinguished from CMV disease, which is CMV infection accompanied by signs and symptoms of CMV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ganciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ganciclovir</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valganciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valganciclovir</a> have been incorporated into strategies designed to prevent CMV disease in patients at risk of CMV reactivation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. As a result, the incidence of CMV disease in the posttransplant setting has declined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>].</p><p>Other herpesviruses including herpes simplex virus (HSV) types 1 and 2 and varicella-zoster virus (VZV) can be significant pathogens after transplantation. Without prophylaxis, approximately 50 percent of patients with HSV will have a recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Antiviral agents used to prevent CMV infection also have activity against HSV and VZV. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-herpes-simplex-virus-type-1-infection-in-immunocompetent-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of herpes simplex virus type 1 infection in immunocompetent patients&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of genital herpes simplex virus infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccination-for-the-prevention-of-shingles-herpes-zoster\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vaccination for the prevention of shingles (herpes zoster)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Prophylactic and preemptive CMV therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients at greatest risk of CMV infection and disease are those without preexisting immunity. As a result, liver transplant recipients who are seronegative for CMV and receive an organ from a CMV-seropositive donor <span class=\"nowrap\">(D+/R-)</span> have the highest risk for developing CMV disease, while CMV-seropositive recipients (R+) have a modest risk, and CMV <span class=\"nowrap\">D-/R-</span> recipients have the lowest risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Cytomegalovirus'</a> below.)</p><p>CMV not only has direct effects on tissues that it infects but also has indirect effects resulting from its ability to modulate the immune system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. CMV infection is associated with an increased risk of bacteremia and invasive fungal infections and an almost fourfold increase in the risk of death within one year of transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-40</a>]. In addition, CMV infection has been associated with an accelerated course of hepatitis C virus recurrence and allograft loss after liver transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. Thus, strategies to reduce the risk of CMV reactivation can also reduce the risk of related infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>Several studies have described varied approaches to prevention including prophylaxis and preemptive therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/43-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-46</a>]. CMV prophylaxis refers to giving an anti-CMV drug to those at increased risk of CMV reactivation (eg, CMV <span class=\"nowrap\">D+/R-,</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">D+/R+,</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">D-/R+),</span> while preemptive therapy refers to giving an anti-CMV drug only when there is evidence of CMV replication (eg, by detection of CMV nucleic acids in serum via polymerase chain reaction [PCR] or CMV antigenemia). Both strategies reduce the risk of CMV disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=valganciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Valganciclovir</a>, a valyl-ester prodrug of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ganciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ganciclovir</a>, has a bioavailability of nearly 70 percent (compared with 7 percent for oral ganciclovir) and at doses of 900 mg daily produces serum ganciclovir levels that are similar to those measured with intravenous (IV) administration of ganciclovir administered at 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> daily.

Despite concerns raised by this trial, valganciclovir is used widely among liver transplant recipients because its bioavailability and ease of administration make it a more attractive option than the intravenous formulation of ganciclovir [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Oral ganciclovir is no longer manufactured in the United States.</p><p>Universal CMV prophylaxis has additional benefits since <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ganciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ganciclovir</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valganciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valganciclovir</a> are active against other herpesviruses including VZV, HSV, and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The use of CMV prophylaxis also reduces the risk of other infections and complications by reducing infections that occur more commonly in patients with CMV reactivation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. As an example, in a retrospective study of 192 liver transplant recipients, there was a significant reduction of bacteremia in patients who had received greater than 14 days of CMV prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In addition, CMV prophylaxis reduced the risk of biopsy-proven rejection in liver transplant recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. In a large retrospective multicenter cohort of more than 7000 hospitalized liver transplant recipients, sepsis diagnosed &gt;100 days after transplant was associated with prior CMV disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p>We recommend CMV prophylaxis in all CMV <span class=\"nowrap\">D+/R-</span> liver transplant recipients due to the high rate of CMV infection and disease in this group. It is also reasonable to use CMV prophylaxis in CMV R+ individuals, although preemptive therapy (monitoring serum CMV PCR or antigenemia and initiating therapy if positive) is an acceptable alternative. These recommendations are in accordance with the 2013 American Society of Transplantation (AST) guidelines and the 2013 International Consensus Guidelines on the Management of Cytomegalovirus in Solid Organ Transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>]. The choice of drug and duration of prophylaxis vary among transplant centers, but most centers use antiviral CMV prophylaxis for three to six months after transplant and during intensification of immunosuppression for rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

In the retrospective study noted above involving hospitalized liver transplant recipients, late-onset CMV disease occurring &gt;100 days after transplant was more common than early-onset CMV disease (4.3 versus 2 percent) and was associated with death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Late-onset CMV disease is relatively uncommon in patients who are managed with preemptive CMV therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].

However, in a study of 71 high-risk (CMV <span class=\"nowrap\">D+/R-)</span> solid organ transplant recipients, weekly virologic monitoring of patients who completed prophylaxis was ineffective at predicting CMV disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Preemptive therapy was successfully used in only 3 of 19 (16 percent) viremic patients, with no progression to CMV disease. The remaining patients with detectable viremia cleared low-level viremia spontaneously (3 patients; 16 percent) or had CMV disease (13 patients; 68 percent), either at the first detection of viremia or before preemptive therapy initiation because of rapid viral load doubling.

In addition, it is important to consider local hospital epidemiology and resistance patterns in the selection of empiric antimicrobial coverage.</p><p>Aminoglycosides are usually avoided in solid organ transplant recipients due to their nephrotoxicity, particularly in combination with calcineurin inhibitors.

In one study, renal transplant recipients with symptomatic CMV infection had higher CMV DNA loads than those without CMV disease; patients with primary CMV infection or reinfection also had higher peak viral loads than those with endogenous reactivation of CMV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. In another study, the initial CMV viral load and the rate of increase of virus in the blood correlated with the risk of developing CMV disease in liver, renal, and bone marrow transplant recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>].</p><p>Either CMV PCR or the CMV antigenemia assay should be used if tissue is not available and CMV infection is suspected. They also allow for the monitoring of viral loads once anti-CMV therapy is instituted. Patients with &quot;compartmentalized&quot; CMV (eg, enteritis or retinitis) may not have detectable CMV viremia, and therefore additional diagnostic procedures may be necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/8,91\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,91</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Other viruses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Varicella-zoster virus (VZV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6), influenza, and adenovirus may also occur during the period of one to six months following transplant. Of these, EBV is the most important because of its potential to cause posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD). Respiratory viruses (such as RSV, parainfluenza, influenza, and adenovirus) were uncommon in one prospective series of adult liver transplant recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. However, the study employed direct immunofluorescence and cell culture to identify viruses, techniques that are less sensitive than the PCR assays now commonly used to diagnose viral infections in the respiratory tract.</p><p>EBV replication can be detected in approximately 20 to 30 percent of transplant recipients and in approximately 80 percent of patients receiving antithymocyte globulin and high doses of immunosuppressants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. EBV infection has a wide range of clinical manifestations including a benign mononucleosis-like syndrome, but the most serious complication of EBV is PTLD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. A major risk factor for PTLD is primary EBV infection after transplant, which occurs when an EBV-seronegative recipient receives an organ from a seropositive donor. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p>HHV-6, the cause of roseola infantum in childhood, has become appreciated as a potential viral pathogen in several series of liver transplant recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/7,93,94\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,93,94</a>]. The virus, like other herpesviruses, remains latent after initial infection and can reactivate during times of immunosuppression. Detection of HHV-6 post-transplant has been associated with fever, rash, cytopenias, interstitial pneumonitis, and hepatitis. However, it remains unclear whether HHV-6 causes these syndromes by directly damaging tissues or via immunomodulatory effects that enhance CMV reactivation, infection by other pathogens, or allograft dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/94,95\" class=\"abstract_t\">94,95</a>]. In one report, two patients with HHV-6 infection, without concomitant CMV infection, had significant graft dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-human-herpesvirus-6-infection-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of human herpesvirus 6 infection in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Aspergillus species</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, most fungal infections following liver transplantation are caused by <em>Candida</em> spp, but <em>Aspergillus</em> infections can also occur. In one series, <em>Aspergillus</em> accounted for about 15 to 20 percent of all fungal infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. A shift in the timing of onset of invasive aspergillosis (IA) in liver transplant recipients has been observed; a study comparing cohorts of patients with IA between 1990 and 1995 and between 1998 and 2001 found that 55 percent of infections in the later cohort compared with 23 percent of those in the earlier cohort occurred at least 90 days after transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]. One potential explanation is that CMV prophylaxis may lead to a delay in IA infections, since CMV reactivation is a risk factor for invasive fungal infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>].</p><p>The most common site of aspergillosis is the lung, although it may disseminate to other sites including the central nervous system (CNS). It is the most common cause of CNS infection in liver transplant recipients, accounting for 55 percent of brain abscesses in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>]. Mortality of aspergillosis in early series of liver transplant recipients approached 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>], but more recent data suggest the outcomes may be improving [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/97,101\" class=\"abstract_t\">97,101</a>].

The risk for tuberculosis among solid organ transplant recipients is much higher than that of the general population and the posttransplant incidence ranges worldwide from 0.3 to 15 percent, depending upon the country [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>]. The disease is presumed to be largely related to reactivation of latent infection, although new infections may also occur in transplant recipients residing in endemic countries. Tuberculosis can have serious consequences when it occurs in the posttransplant setting. Disseminated infection is common in transplant recipients and is associated with a high mortality rate (29 percent in a review of 499 patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">After six months</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Opportunistic infections are uncommon beyond six months post-transplant in patients who have good graft function since immunosuppression has generally been tapered to a maintenance regimen. These patients usually develop the same types of community-acquired infections seen in the general population, although at an increased rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Transplant recipients may be more susceptible to some pathogens such as <em>Legionella </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>] and may experience more severe manifestations of certain infections such as West Nile virus infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>].</p><p>On the other hand, patients with impaired graft function or those receiving higher levels of immunosuppressive medications are at risk for the infections typically encountered during the period of one to six months after transplant. One of these is <em>Cryptococcus neoformans</em>, which usually causes meningitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cryptococcus-neoformans-meningoencephalitis-in-hiv-seronegative-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Cryptococcus neoformans meningoencephalitis in HIV-seronegative patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients on chronic immunosuppression often initially have only subtle findings of infection due to attenuation of inflammatory responses by immunosuppressants, but this may be followed by a precipitous decline in status and severe manifestations of infection. Respiratory infections due to pathogens such as <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em> and <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> can be life threatening if not promptly treated. Patients who have chronic rejection are also more susceptible to chronic viral infections, possibly from the increased immunosuppressive regimens.</p><p>Chronic or recurrent viral infections including those due to EBV, CMV, hepatitis B (HBV), hepatitis C (HCV), and human herpesviruses 6 and 7 also can lead to complications in the late posttransplant period. As an example, CMV infection can be persistent or occur following prophylaxis discontinuation or following treatment for allograft rejection, with manifestations as described above. In addition, the immunomodulatory effects of CMV and other viruses may increase the risk of opportunistic infections such as <em>P. jirovecii</em> (formerly <em>P. carinii</em>) pneumonia (PCP) and invasive aspergillosis. As mentioned above, CMV infection has also been associated with ductopenic rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>].</p><p>Chronic viral infections can also produce damage to the liver allograft (HBV and HCV) or cause secondary tumors during this period, including posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease due to EBV and hepatocellular carcinoma due to HBV or HCV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Hepatitis E virus (HEV) can also cause chronic hepatitis in liver transplant recipients and should be considered in patients with unexplained liver enzyme elevations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>].

Endemic fungal infections may represent reactivation of disease or new infection. Listeriosis has been noted in patients on chronic immunosuppression. It is usually associated with meningitis but can also cause hepatitis and bacteremia. Transmission of <em>Listeria</em> is usually through contaminated dairy products. The stable low incidence of <em>Listeria</em> can be partially attributed to some protection from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> prophylaxis for PCP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infectious-complications-in-liver-transplantation/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>].

In many centers, infection is the most frequent cause of death following liver transplantation even though deaths related to infectious diseases in non-transplant settings have steadily decreased. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identification of risk factors for infection before transplantation permits the optimal use of strategies for preventing infections in the posttransplant setting.

(See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to screening potential liver donors and recipients for infection, there are several approaches to the prevention of infections in liver transplant patients. These include vaccination, the administration of prophylactic antimicrobials to patients at increased risk for specific infections, preemptive therapy, targeted prophylaxis, and educated avoidance. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> (TMP-SMX) be administered after liver transplantation to reduce the risk of <em>Pneumocystis jirovecii</em> (formerly <em>P.</em> <em>carinii</em>) pneumonia (PCP). It is generally administered for 6 to 12 months. In addition to preventing PCP, TMP-SMX also prevents infections with other sensitive organisms including <em>Listeria monocytogenes</em>, <em>Nocardia asteroides</em>, <em>Toxoplasma gondii</em>, and many common urinary, respiratory, and gastrointestinal bacterial pathogens.

It is also reasonable to use CMV prophylaxis in CMV R+ individuals, although preemptive therapy (monitoring CMV polymerase chain reaction [PCR] or antigenemia and initiating therapy if positive) is an acceptable alternative. The choice of drug and duration of prophylaxis vary among transplant centers, but most centers use antiviral CMV prophylaxis for three to six months after transplant and during intensification of immunosuppression for rejection. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Herpesviruses'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients who do not receive CMV prophylaxis, we recommend that an antiviral with activity against HSV and VZV (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valacyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valacyclovir</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=famciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">famciclovir</a>) be given during the first three to six months after transplantation and during periods of intensified immunosuppression (treatment of graft rejection) or other &quot;stresses&quot; (concomitant infection or surgery). (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Prophylactic and preemptive CMV therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Candida</em> is the predominant fungal infection encountered after liver transplantation, with a shift toward infection due to non-albicans <em>Candida</em> spp. <em>Aspergillus</em> infections occur in patients with certain risk factors. While antifungal prophylaxis is commonly used in liver transplant recipients, the optimal patient population, dose, and duration of prophylaxis remain to be defined. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Fungal infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk of infection and types of infections differ based upon the time after transplantation, although, with changes in immunosuppressive agents over time and the institution of prophylaxis for various infections, the timeline of infection has been altered to some extent. Nevertheless, most postoperative infections can be grouped into three major periods: transplant to one month, one month to six months, and after six months. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Time course of infections'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infections occurring immediately following transplantation are similar to those seen in immunocompetent hosts following surgery, such as wound infections, pneumonia, and infections resulting from technical issues. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Transplant to one month'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Opportunistic infections tend to occur one to six months after transplant due to the cumulative effect of relatively high-dose immunosuppression.
