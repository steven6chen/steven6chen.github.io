The spectrum of PZA is relatively narrow; it demonstrates clinically significant antibacterial activity only against <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> and <em>Mycobacterium africanum </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyrazinamide-an-overview/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Issues related to the clinical use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyrazinamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pyrazinamide</a> will be reviewed here. Issues related to treatment of latent and active TB are discussed separately. (See related topics.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF ACTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The parent compound is metabolized via pyrazinamidase (PZase) to pyrazinoic acid; pyrazinoic acid is the active form of the drug [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyrazinamide-an-overview/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The mechanism of action for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyrazinamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pyrazinamide</a> (PZA) is unknown. PZA and its analog, 5-chloro-PZA, may inhibit the fatty acid synthetase I (FASI) enzyme of <em>M. tuberculosis</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyrazinamide-an-overview/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. PZA is generally considered to be a bacteriostatic agent.</p><p>PZA is thought to be more active at an acidic pH (eg, within macrophages) and against dormant or semidormant microorganisms, although the role of PZA against intracellular organisms remains uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyrazinamide-an-overview/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In one study, pyrazinoic acid remained outside of <em>M. tuberculosis</em> cells at a neutral or alkaline pH but accumulated within cells at an acidic pH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyrazinamide-an-overview/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In the same study, <em>Mycobacterium smegmatis</em> (which is not susceptible to PZA) was found to convert PZA to pyrazinoic acid but, due to an active efflux mechanism, did not accumulate the metabolite, even at an acidic pH. Other mycobacterial strains appear to have natural resistance to PZA due to lack of PZase activity or absence of transport mechanisms to take up the drug [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyrazinamide-an-overview/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>When used as part of combination therapy, PZA appears to accelerate the sterilizing effect of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoniazid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoniazid</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyrazinamide-an-overview/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In selected populations, this has enabled reduction in the duration of treatment infection due to susceptible <em>M. tuberculosis</em> isolates from nine to six months.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">RESISTANCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyrazinamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Pyrazinamide</a> (PZA) is not used as monotherapy in the treatment of <em>M. tuberculosis</em> because of the rapid development of resistance to the drug. The major mechanism of resistance to PZA arises from mutations in the gene encoding PZase, <em>pncA</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyrazinamide-an-overview/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. A number of different mutations in this gene have been demonstrated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyrazinamide-an-overview/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. Overall rates of tuberculosis resistance to PZA have been reported to be approximately 16 percent, and up to 60 percent in patients with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyrazinamide-an-overview/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOKINETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Absorption of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyrazinamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pyrazinamide</a> (PZA) is thought to be rapid after oral administration, with peak serum concentrations achieved within one to two hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyrazinamide-an-overview/abstract/1,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,12</a>]. Only minor changes in bioavailability and peak serum concentrations are demonstrated when PZA is taken with meals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyrazinamide-an-overview/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Serum concentrations have been reported to range from 30 to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> after a 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyrazinamide-an-overview/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>PZA is thought to be widely distributed in many body tissues and fluids, with a volume of distribution estimated to be 0.6 to 0.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/kg</span>. Intrapulmonary concentrations of PZA are high (4 to 40 times the reported minimum inhibitory concentration for PZA-susceptible strains in one study) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyrazinamide-an-overview/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. PZA distributes well into the cerebrospinal fluid, with concentrations reported to be similar to those observed in simultaneous serum samples. Intracellular PZA concentrations are similar to those of extracellular fluids. Children appear to have a larger volume of distribution and a slower absorption and clearance of PZA than adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyrazinamide-an-overview/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>PZA undergoes extensive hepatic metabolism. Approximately 70 percent of the dose is excreted in the urine in the form of metabolites. The half-life is approximately 9 to 10 hours in patients with normal renal and hepatic function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyrazinamide-an-overview/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The drug and its metabolites are removed by hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyrazinamide-an-overview/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DOSING AND ADMINISTRATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Daily doses are 15 to 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day (up to a maximum of 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day)</span> in children and 20 to 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day in adults (maximum of 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day)</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F73765\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73765 \">table 1</a>). Intermittent dosing is performed as part of directly observed therapy (DOT).

This study suggested that optimal dosing may be between 35 and <span class=\"nowrap\">50mg/kg/day</span> for most patients.
