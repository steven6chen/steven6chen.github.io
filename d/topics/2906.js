(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognosis-of-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognosis of heart failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Cardiac dysfunction is defined as an alteration in the relationship between preload (often defined by left ventricular filling pressure) and stroke volume. This relationship is depicted by Frank-Starling curves, which identify a shift downward and to the right as cardiac dysfunction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F58693\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58693 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Remodeling is defined as alteration in the structure (dimensions, mass, shape) of the heart (called cardiac or ventricular remodeling) in response to hemodynamic load <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cardiac injury in association with neurohormonal activation. Remodeling may be described as physiologic or pathologic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-basic-aspects/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]; alternatively, remodeling may be classified as adaptive or maladaptive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-basic-aspects/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p>The remodeling process frequently includes increases in myocardial mass. The heart can respond to environmental stimuli by growth (increased myocardial mass) or shrinkage (atrophy) with a dynamic range of at least 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-basic-aspects/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Myocardial hypertrophy is most properly defined as increased cardiomyocyte size which may occur with or without an increase in overall myocardial mass; however, the term &quot;hypertrophy&quot; has also been used to denote increased myocardial mass <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> wall thickness.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physiologic remodeling is a compensatory change in the dimensions and function of the heart in response to physiologic stimuli such as exercise and pregnancy. This type of remodeling is seen in athletes and has been called &quot;athlete's heart.&quot; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-and-classification-of-the-cardiomyopathies#H1613344\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition and classification of the cardiomyopathies&quot;, section on 'Athlete's heart'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pathologic remodeling may occur with pressure overload (eg, aortic stenosis, hypertension), volume overload (eg, valvular regurgitation), or following cardiac injury (eg, myocardial infarction, myocarditis, or idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy). In each of these settings, remodeling may transition from an apparently compensatory process to a maladaptive one [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-basic-aspects/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p>Three general patterns of remodeling have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-basic-aspects/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pressure overload leads to concentric left ventricular remodeling with or without an overall increase in myocardial mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-basic-aspects/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Concentric remodeling is characterized by increased relative wall thickness (ventricular wall thickness as compared to cavity size). With concentric hypertrophy, sarcomeres are added in parallel and individual cardiomyocytes grow thicker.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Volume overload or isotonic exercise leads to eccentric left ventricular hypertrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-basic-aspects/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Eccentric left ventricular hypertrophy is characterized by increased cardiac mass and chamber volume. Relative wall thickness may be normal, increased, or decreased. With eccentric hypertrophy, sarcomeres are added in series and individual cardiomyocytes grow longer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following myocardial infarction, stretched infarcted tissue increases left ventricular volume leading to combined volume and pressure load on noninfarcted zones and mixed <span class=\"nowrap\">concentric/eccentric</span> hypertrophy.</p><p/><p>The importance of remodeling as a pathogenic mechanism has been controversial, since factors leading to remodeling as well as the remodeling itself may be major determinants of HF prognosis. Consistent with the hypothesis that remodeling is pathogenically important in HF is the observation that angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and some beta blockers, which improve survival in patients with HF, can slow and in some cases even reverse, certain parameters of cardiac remodeling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-basic-aspects/abstract/6-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-10</a>].</p><p>In addition, an initial report indicated that reversal of remodeling with both medical therapy and a left ventricular assist device is associated with marked improvements in left ventricular function in patients with advanced heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-basic-aspects/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-therapy-of-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the therapy of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intermediate-and-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intermediate- and long-term mechanical circulatory support&quot;</a>). An analysis of clinical trial data confirms the importance of remodeling in determining prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-basic-aspects/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>The basic aspects of cardiac remodeling, such as the mechanisms involved, the factors influencing remodeling, its role in heart failure progression, and measurement of remodeling, will be reviewed here. The clinical assessment and treatment of remodeling are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-remodeling-clinical-assessment-and-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac remodeling: Clinical assessment and therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">BASIC CONCEPTS OF CARDIAC REMODELING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The different causes of cardiac remodeling share common molecular, biochemical, and mechanical pathways. The myocyte is the major cardiac cell involved in the remodeling process. Other components include the interstitium, fibroblasts, collagen, and coronary vasculature. The process of cardiac remodeling is influenced by hemodynamic load, neurohumoral activation, and other factors.</p><p>A common setting in which remodeling occurs is after myocardial infarction. In animal models and humans, left ventricular (LV) remodeling usually begins within the first few hours after the infarct and progresses over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-basic-aspects/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>]. The entire heart may be involved, as disproportionate thinning and dilation in the infarct region (ie, infarct expansion) is accompanied by a distortion in shape of the entire heart with volume-overload hypertrophy of noninfarcted myocardium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-basic-aspects/abstract/14,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,17</a>]. Patients with no or limited dilation at four weeks tend to remain stable, while those with progressive dilation over this period tend to deteriorate over time with loss of function in initially normally contracting myocardium (ie, pathologic remodeling) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-basic-aspects/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Data from the GISSI-3 trial suggest that serial electrocardiographic changes, particular involving negative T waves, can predict postinfarction remodeling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-basic-aspects/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Lack of negative T wave resolution or the late appearance of new negative T waves are associated with less recovery of wall motion abnormalities, more pronounced left ventricular enlargement, and progressive deterioration of ventricular function; in contrast, normalization of negative T waves is related to functional recovery of viable myocardium and is more useful than QRS changes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=electrocardiogram-in-the-diagnosis-of-myocardial-ischemia-and-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Electrocardiogram in the diagnosis of myocardial ischemia and infarction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Functional changes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial remodeling phase after a myocardial infarction results in repair of the necrotic area and scar formation that may, to some extent, be considered beneficial since there is an improvement in or maintenance of LV function and cardiac output [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-basic-aspects/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. This cellular rearrangement of the ventricular wall is associated with a significant increase in LV volume. Some studies have shown that this volume increase is not a prerequisite to maintaining LV function.</p><p>As the heart undergoes remodeling, it becomes less elliptical and more spherical (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F69944\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69944 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-basic-aspects/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. There are also changes in ventricular mass, composition, and volume, all of which may adversely affect cardiac function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-basic-aspects/abstract/17,18,24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18,24-26</a>].</p><p>The time course and extent of remodeling are influenced by a variety of factors including the severity of the underlying disease, secondary events (such as recurrent ischemia), neuroendocrine activation, genotype, and treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-basic-aspects/abstract/14,24,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,24,27</a>]. Following myocardial infarction, for example, the magnitude of remodeling changes is roughly related to infarct size [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-basic-aspects/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. In a human study, left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes increased progressively from hospital discharge to one year after an initial, moderately large anterior wall Q wave infarction, but remained stable in patients with an initial small inferior wall infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-basic-aspects/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>In patients with progressive postinfarction dilation, the end-systolic volume index increases progressively and LV ejection fraction (LVEF) declines due in part to the chamber enlargement itself and in part to loss of function in initially normally contracting myocardium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-basic-aspects/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. These changes are important predictors of mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-basic-aspects/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Cellular and molecular changes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Remodeling is associated with a number of cellular changes including myocyte hypertrophy, loss of myocytes due to apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-basic-aspects/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>] or necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-basic-aspects/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], and fibroblast proliferation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-basic-aspects/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>] and fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-basic-aspects/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].</p><p>Although the pathways and cells involved in LV remodeling are incompletely understood, mechanisms at the molecular level have been proposed:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As myocytes stretch, there is an increase in the local production or release of angiotensin II, norepinephrine, and endothelin. Locally generated angiotensin II is thought to play a role in these processes, in part via alterations in gene expression (see <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Role of angiotensin II'</a> below) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-basic-aspects/abstract/20,36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,36-38</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>These neurohormonal changes stimulate expression of proteins and myocyte hypertrophy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increases in angiotensin II, aldosterone, and cytokines stimulate collagen synthesis, leading to fibrosis and remodeling of the extracellular matrix.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduced nitric oxide bioactivity contributes to the cellular and interstitial growth since nitric oxide normally serves as an inhibitor of remodeling.</p><p/><p>The end result of pathologic remodeling is further deterioration in cardiac performance and increased neurohormonal activation. In addition, it has been suggested that remodeling and the myocardial changes that accompany it contribute to the pathogenesis of ventricular arrhythmias. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-ventricular-tachycardia-and-ventricular-fibrillation-during-acute-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation during acute myocardial infarction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Cardiac myocytes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Myocytes and other cardiac cell types are thought to be fundamentally involved in the remodeling process. After an insult of sufficient magnitude, myocyte numbers decrease and surviving myocytes become elongated or hypertrophied as part of a compensatory process to maintain stroke volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-basic-aspects/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]; the thickness of the ventricular wall also may increase due to myocyte hypertrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-basic-aspects/abstract/17,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,25,26</a>].</p><p>Altered loading conditions (eg, increased preload) stretch cell membranes and increase wall stress, which may play a role in inducing the expression of hypertrophy associated genes. In cardiac myocytes, this may lead to the synthesis of new contractile proteins and the assembly of new sarcomeres. It is thought that the pattern in which these proteins are laid down determines whether the cardiac myocytes elongate or increase their diameter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-basic-aspects/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The increase in wall stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-basic-aspects/abstract/25,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,37</a>] may precipitate energy imbalance and ischemia, leading to a vicious cycle of increased wall stress and wall thickness with further energy imbalance and ischemia.</p><p>Cardiac troponin I and T, which are released during myocyte injury, are elevated in some patients with heart failure (HF), even in the absence of coronary artery disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-basic-aspects/abstract/40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-42</a>]. Using a high-sensitivity assay, the level of troponin is an independent predictor of mortality that supplements the prognostic value of B-type natriuretic peptide levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-basic-aspects/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. These data suggest that troponin release may be a marker for ongoing myocyte damage. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=troponin-testing-clinical-use\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Troponin testing: Clinical use&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Collagen synthesis and degradation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The myocardium consists of myocytes tethered and supported by a connective tissue network composed largely of fibrillar collagen. Collagen is synthesized by interstitial fibroblasts and degraded by locally produced enzymes called collagenases, such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs).</p><p>The significance of collagen synthesis and degradation in cardiac remodeling and HF is supported by the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In human and animal models of remodeling after myocardial infarction, fibroblast stimulation increases collagen synthesis and causes fibrosis of both the infarcted and noninfarcted regions of the ventricle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-basic-aspects/abstract/34,35,44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35,44,45</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myocardial collagenase is present in the inactive form in the ventricle and is activated after myocardial injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-basic-aspects/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. This may contribute to an increase in chamber dimension and is a possible cause of myocyte slippage, a contributor to chamber remodeling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-basic-aspects/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an animal model of hypertension and HF, increased expression of MMPs coincided with the transition from hypertrophy to HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-basic-aspects/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a series of hypertensive patients with HF, those with reduced ejection fraction had a lower collagen volume fraction and a higher expression of MMP-1 (collagenase) than those with diastolic dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-basic-aspects/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. The increases in MMP-1 expression and collagen degradation were directly correlated with end-diastolic volume and inversely correlated with LVEF.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MMP-9 (gelatinase B) is markedly overexpressed after myocardial infarction and may be a mediator of collagen accumulation and remodeling. Mice with targeted deletion of MMP-9 or those given an MMP inhibitor have less collagen accumulation in the infarcted areas and less LV dilation than wild-type or control mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-basic-aspects/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>]. A similar benefit from MMP inhibition on attenuating remodeling was seen in another animal model of chronic volume overload [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-basic-aspects/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p/><p>On the other hand, lack of MMP-9 function may increase susceptibility to viral myocarditis. Mice with a targeted deletion of MMP-9 were found to be more susceptible to cardiac infection by coxsackie virus as evidenced by increased viral titer and cardiac fibrosis and decreased cardiac output [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-basic-aspects/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is another protein overexpressed in HF (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=natriuretic-peptide-measurement-in-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Natriuretic peptide measurement in heart failure&quot;</a>). Studies in BNP knockout mice reveal increased cardiac fibrosis in response to ventricular pressure overload, suggesting that the release of BNP from myocytes in the failing heart may protect against pathologic remodeling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-basic-aspects/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Apoptosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It has been proposed that increased apoptosis with loss of myocytes contributes to progressive LV dysfunction in chronic HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-basic-aspects/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The importance of this type of cell death in human cardiac remodeling is not firmly established. However, in myocardial samples from patients who underwent heart transplantation, apoptosis was increased more than 200-fold in the failing heart [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-basic-aspects/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Likewise, increased apoptosis is associated with the maladaptive response to sustained pressure overload (increased afterload) in the rat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-basic-aspects/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Furthermore, in a mouse model of HF, specific inhibition of apoptosis was beneficial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-basic-aspects/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Additional evidence that apoptosis is involved in adverse remodeling and HF post-myocardial infarction comes from mice in which the proapoptotic protein Bnip3 was ablated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-basic-aspects/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">FACTORS INFLUENCING CARDIAC REMODELING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a number of factors that can influence remodeling, including LV hemodynamics, hypertension, and neurohormonal activation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Changes in hemodynamic load</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early left ventricular (LV) dilation in patients with anterior wall infarction may be progressive; on the other hand, compensatory ventricular hypertrophy appears to be a delayed and limited adaptation during the first year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-basic-aspects/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The net effect of progressive ventricular dilation with insufficient reactive ventricular hypertrophy is a considerable increase in global LV wall tension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-basic-aspects/abstract/24,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,58</a>]. A number of mechanisms may be stimulated by increased wall stress which, in the absence of effective therapy, may lead to further dilation of the heart and progressive heart failure (HF) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-basic-aspects/abstract/26,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,59</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood pressure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Elevated blood pressure induces structural changes in the LV (hypertrophy, interstitial changes), which may result in diastolic dysfunction that may progress to heart failure. The functional impact of pressure overload hypertrophy may be dependent on the nature of the remodeling process. When remodeling is eccentric (left ventricular enlargement with normal relative wall thickness, but increased wall stress) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-basic-aspects/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>], a functional impairment leading to heart failure was observed. In contrast, heart failure did not occur in animals with concentric remodeling (normal chamber size, increased relative wall thickness, and normal wall stress). There was no difference between the two groups in myocardial mass or contractile function. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-implications-and-treatment-of-left-ventricular-hypertrophy-in-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical implications and treatment of left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertension&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Myocardial infarction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antecedent hypertension may be associated with greater adverse remodeling and development of HF after myocardial infarction (MI). This was demonstrated in a series of 1093 patients, 68 percent of whom underwent serial neurohormonal sampling and evaluation of LV function one to four days and three to five months post-MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-basic-aspects/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Compared with normotensives, hypertensive patients had significantly higher plasma levels of neurohormones at both time periods and a significantly greater increase in LV volumes (ie, remodeling) at five months. Normotensives, but not hypertensives, had an improvement in LV ejection fraction (LVEF) at five months. Antecedent hypertension was associated with an increased risk of heart failure requiring hospitalization at a mean follow-up of two years (12.4 versus 5.5 percent in normotensives).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurohormonal activation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Progressive HF is associated with neurohumoral activation that may be viewed initially as compensatory but may contribute to progression of the structural abnormalities. The net effect is progressive increases in the release of the three &quot;hypovolemic&quot; hormones (renin, norepinephrine, and antidiuretic hormone) that is generally proportional to the severity of the ventricular dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-basic-aspects/abstract/62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63</a>]. High plasma norepinephrine, renin activity, and antidiuretic hormone levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-basic-aspects/abstract/64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65</a>] are markers for poor survival in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-basic-aspects/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].

The data are most compelling for activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system.

As an example, an increase in ventricular load (preload), as in mitral insufficiency, modulates remodeling of the ventricle to maintain forward flow. In addition, approximately 25 percent of patients with a first myocardial infarction develop limited left ventricular dilatation within four weeks after first infarction, which helps to restore cardiac index at rest and to preserve exercise performance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-basic-aspects/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>By comparison, progressive remodeling is deleterious and associated with a poor prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-basic-aspects/abstract/18,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,28</a>]. There are no data to indicate when the transition from possible adaptive to maladaptive remodeling occurs or how this might be identified in patients. The occurrence of such a transition and its time course may be expected to vary greatly. However, once established beyond a certain phase, it is likely that remodeling actually contributes to heart failure (HF) progression. As mentioned above, an important factor in patients with a myocardial infarction is the size of the infarct. Progressive remodeling is common after an initial, moderately large anterior wall Q wave infarction, but is unusual after an initial small inferior wall infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-remodeling-basic-aspects/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5487520\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Remodeling is defined as an alteration in the structure <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> function of the heart in response to hemodynamic load <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cardiac injury.
