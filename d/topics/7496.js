It is a disease of morbidity, not mortality. It is most frequently encountered in mountaineers and other cold weather enthusiasts, soldiers, those who work in the cold, the homeless, and individuals stranded outdoors in the winter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frostbite/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. Among patients with severe frostbite, timely diagnosis and treatment is essential to maximize tissue salvage. </p><p>This topic review will discuss the classification, presentation, diagnosis, and management of frostbite. Severe hypothermia, high altitude illness, and other related illnesses are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=accidental-hypothermia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Accidental hypothermia in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-altitude-illness-physiology-risk-factors-and-general-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;High altitude illness: Physiology, risk factors, and general prevention&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-mountain-sickness-and-high-altitude-cerebral-edema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute mountain sickness and high altitude cerebral edema&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-altitude-pulmonary-edema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;High altitude pulmonary edema&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-altitude-disease-unique-pediatric-considerations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;High altitude disease: Unique pediatric considerations&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Frostbite is a severe, localized cold-induced injury due to freezing of tissue. Immersion foot (also referred to as trench foot) is a nonfreezing cold injury (NFCI) that may also cause tissue loss and long-term sequelae. Milder forms of injury include frostnip and pernio:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Frostnip refers to cold-induced, localized paresthesias that resolve with rewarming. There is no permanent tissue damage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pernio, or chilblains, is characterized by localized inflammatory lesions that can result from acute or repetitive exposure to damp cold above the freezing point. Lesions are edematous, often reddish or purple, and may be very painful or pruritic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F101018\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101018 \">picture 1</a>). Pernio is most common in young women, but both sexes and all age ranges may be affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frostbite/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Permanent damage from pernio is uncommon, with symptoms and signs generally resolving within two to three weeks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immersion foot (or trench foot) involves injury to the sympathetic nerves and vasculature of the feet. It was first described in 1914 during World War I trench warfare. It results from prolonged exposure of the feet to a combination of dampness and cold. Tight-fitting boots exacerbate the condition. Feet and occasionally hands are red, edematous, can be numb or extremely painful, and, in severe cases, can be covered with hemorrhagic bullae (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F101027\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101027 \">picture 2</a>). Tissue loss can occur.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Improved foot hygiene including better boot design and frequent sock changes resulted in a much lower prevalence among soldiers by 1917. Not just of historical significance, immersion foot was a major medical issue during the Falklands War of 1982 and still occurs, especially among the homeless [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frostbite/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The tissue destruction of frostbite is due to both immediate cold-induced cell death and the more gradual development of reperfusion-related localized inflammatory processes and tissue ischemia. Following exposure to subfreezing temperatures, ice crystals form extracellularly. If freezing is rapid, ice crystals may also form inside cells. Fluid and electrolyte fluxes cause lysis of cell membranes with subsequent cell death. An inflammatory process ensues mediated by thromboxane A2, prostaglandin F2-alpha, bradykinins, and histamine. This leads to tissue ischemia and necrosis. The initial cellular damage and the subsequent inflammatory processes are made worse in the setting of thawing followed by refreezing of the affected area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frostbite/abstract/3,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of systems to classify frostbite have been developed based on initial clinical presentation, findings on scintigraphy with technetium-99m pertechnetate, and outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frostbite/abstract/3,9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,9-11</a>].</p><p>One classification scheme categorizes frostbite injuries as superficial or deep. As described below, superficial frostbite corresponds to first and second-degree injury, while deep frostbite corresponds to third and fourth-degree injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frostbite/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p>A more useful clinical prediction tool has been developed for frostbite of the hands and feet, based on the level at which skin lesions are noted after rapid rewarming in warm water. The categories are as follow (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F111122\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111122 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade 1 frostbite is characterized by no cyanosis on the extremity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F111118\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef111118 \">picture 3</a>). This predicts no amputation and no sequelae.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade 2 involves cyanosis isolated to the distal phalanx (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F111119\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef111119 \">picture 4</a>). This predicts only soft tissue amputation and fingernail or toenail sequelae.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade 3 frostbite is characterized by intermediate and proximal phalangeal cyanosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F111120\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef111120 \">picture 5</a>). This predicts bone amputation of the digit and functional sequelae.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade 4 frostbite involves cyanosis over the carpal or tarsal bones (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F111121\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef111121 \">picture 6</a>). This predicts bone amputation of the limb with functional sequelae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frostbite/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p>The traditional classification system divides frostbite into four degrees of severity based upon the depth of tissue involvement, in similar fashion to the classification of burns:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>First-degree frostbite is very superficial and is characterized by a central area of pallor and anesthesia of the skin surrounded by edema.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Second-degree frostbite is recognized by large blisters containing clear fluid surrounded by edema and erythema, developing within 24 hours and extending to or nearly to the tips of digits (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F101059\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101059 \">picture 7</a>). The blisters may form an eschar, but this later sloughs off, revealing healthy granulation tissue. There is no tissue loss.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Third-degree frostbite differs from second-degree in that the injury is deeper and the blisters are smaller, hemorrhagic and more proximal. The skin forms a black eschar in one to several weeks (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F101022\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101022 \">picture 8</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F101023\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101023 \">picture 9</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fourth-degree frostbite, which extends to muscle and bone, involves complete tissue necrosis. Mummification occurs in 4 to 10 days.</p><p/><p>This traditional system gives clinicians a false sense of accuracy. It has caused many to treat frostbite injuries as if they were burns, with suboptimal results. Depending upon rewarming methods and complications, such as infection or trauma, first and second-degree frostbite can unexpectedly become third or fourth-degree.</p><p>The Hennepin Score, patterned after total body surface scoring systems for thermal burns, is used for research purposes to describe the extent of tissue involved and quantify tissue salvage rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frostbite/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. It is not a clinical tool.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Frostbite generally develops within minutes to hours depending on circumstances and risk factors. Risk factors for developing frostbite and cold-induced injury include any condition that increases localized heat loss or decreases heat production. Examples include increased convective heat loss due to exposure to wind or conductive heat loss due to contact with metal, the ground, or water [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frostbite/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Exhaustion, dehydration, malnutrition, or comorbidities such as peripheral vascular disease, diabetes, or mental illness may limit an individual's ability to respond to a cold stress. Alcohol abuse predisposes to frostbite as a result of acute behavioral changes, increased heat loss from vasodilation, and chronic complications of alcohol consumption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frostbite/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Other sedating or judgment impairing drugs or medications pose a similar risk. Clearly, risk is greater at low ambient temperatures, when wind chill effects are increased, and at higher altitudes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frostbite/abstract/4,16-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,16-20</a>].</p><p>Additional risk factors for developing frostbite include smoking, previous cold injury, and exposure of the hands and arms to vibration, which can elicit a Raynaud phenomenon associated with white fingers in some individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frostbite/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. Data from the United States Armed Forces suggest that soldiers who are African-American, female, or younger than 20 years of age are at increased risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frostbite/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Use of clothing that provides inadequate insulation or coverage, or is damp, too tight, or permeable to wind, can predispose to frostbite, as can use of protective ointments, such as on the face. Excessive sweating of the hands and feet increases an individual's risk of frostbite to those areas, illustrating the importance of clothing that can wick moisture away from the skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frostbite/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>While generally considered a disease associated with environmental exposure to cold, frostbite has also been reported following direct exposure to freezing materials. As an example, the application of ice packs to reduce swelling from musculoskeletal injuries can cause frostbite [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frostbite/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. It is important to tell patients to interpose a cloth between the ice pack and their skin, and to limit treatment intervals to 20 minutes with a minute or two break between applications. Fingertip contact with a metal surface at a temp of 15&deg;C (5&deg;F) can lead to frostbite within a few seconds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frostbite/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p>Case reports describe severe facial, upper airway, and esophageal frostbite from recreational inhalation of halogenated hydrocarbons. Contact with Freon, a fluorinated hydrocarbon used as a refrigerant, has been reported to cause third and fourth-degree frostbite of the hand [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frostbite/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. Frostbite of the foot has been described resulting from the discharge of a carbon dioxide fire extinguisher on a sprained ankle in an attempt to reduce edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frostbite/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Some researchers hypothesize that individual variation in cold-induced vasodilation (CIVD) corresponds to the risk of frostbite. One small, observational study of United States Marines during winter deployment suggests that faster and greater CIVD may decrease risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frostbite/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because there is no formal reporting system for cases of frostbite, data on incidence and prevalence are derived from selected subpopulations, generally consisting of individuals at greater than average risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frostbite/abstract/22,25,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,25,32</a>]. Based upon such studies, the areas of the body most susceptible to frostbite appear to be the hands, feet, face (including nose and cheeks), and ears.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Areas most frequently affected by frostbite include the ears, nose, cheeks, chin, fingers, and toes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F101058\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101058 \">picture 10</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F101026\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101026 \">picture 11</a>). Frostbite of the cornea has been reported in individuals who keep their eyes open against very strong winds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frostbite/abstract/7,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,33</a>]. Patients often complain of cold, numbness, and clumsiness of the affected area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frostbite/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Before rewarming, the skin is insensate, white or grayish-yellow in color, and hard or waxy to touch (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F101025\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101025 \">picture 12</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F101024\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101024 \">picture 13</a>). As noted above, bullae containing clear or bloody fluid may develop after thawing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F101059\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101059 \">picture 7</a>), depending on the depth of the injury. In cases of delayed presentation to medical care, eschar or other signs of tissue necrosis may be observed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F101022\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101022 \">picture 8</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F101023\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101023 \">picture 9</a>). Any patient with cyanosis proximal to the distal phalanx of any digit after rapid rewarming is at risk for necrosis of the affected tissue and aggressive therapy (eg, thrombolysis in suitable candidates) may be needed. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Hospital-based management'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnosis is generally made on clinical grounds, based on the context of the injury, signs, and symptoms. Diagnostic studies&ndash;namely bone scanning&ndash;are helpful in determining the existence of comorbidities, the extent of frostbite injury, and prognosis. Because frostbite is a disease of morbidity, not mortality, more immediate life-threats, such as coexisting hypothermia, must be identified and addressed first. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=accidental-hypothermia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Accidental hypothermia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H317501307\"><span class=\"h1\">IMAGING STUDIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radiologic studies can help to determine the extent of tissue involvement, response to therapy, and long-term tissue viability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frostbite/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The most important study for patients with signs of or at risk for tissue necrosis from frostbite is technetium (Tc)-99m scintigraphy (ie, bone scan). The appropriate role for each modality is described below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Plain radiographs</strong> are not useful initially except to screen for trauma-related fractures. Late (weeks to months) radiographic findings in frostbite include bony destruction and, in children, damage to growth plates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frostbite/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Frostbite arthritis often spares the thumbs, most likely because patients wrap them within clenched fists during the exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frostbite/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Standard or digital subtraction angiography</strong> can be used to identify patients suitable for thrombolytic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frostbite/abstract/37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-39</a>]. Unlike technetium-99m scintigraphy, angiography does not visualize the microcirculation soon after injury, including in bone.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Technetium (Tc)-99m scintigraphy</strong> (ie, bone scan) can be used to identify candidates suitable for thrombolytic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frostbite/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. It is also used to predict the long-term viability of affected tissue, with the goal of allowing early debridement or amputation of dead or dying areas while preserving viable tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frostbite/abstract/11,14,41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,14,41,42</a>]. In candidates for treatment with tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), technetium scanning is used immediately after thawing. For patients who are not candidates for tPA, technetium scanning on day 2 following injury may avoid the need for the traditional several-week delay in surgical intervention while awaiting demarcation between viable and nonviable zones. Scintigraphy has also been used to monitor response to a topical therapy protocol by demonstrating the effect of treatment on involved tissue microvasculature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frostbite/abstract/9,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,43</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limited retrospective data suggest that <strong>single-photon emission computed tomography</strong> (SPECT), a nuclear bone scan processed similarly to a computed tomography (CT) scan, combined with conventional CT <span class=\"nowrap\">(SPECT/CT),</span> may be able to identify non-salvageable tissue, allowing more accurate determination of the extent of tissue destruction and autoamputation than a conventional bone scan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frostbite/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some researchers claim that <strong>magnetic resonance imaging</strong> (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) may be superior to bone scans in establishing tissue viability. In case reports they have permitted visualization of occluded blood vessels and better demonstrated the line of demarcation between ischemic and nonischemic tissue. However, experience with MRI and MRA in this setting is limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frostbite/abstract/8,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,45</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment can be divided into prehospital interventions and definitive care. The approach described below is based on animal studies, observational data, clinical experience, and relatively small number of clinical trials. Management of hypothermia is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=accidental-hypothermia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Accidental hypothermia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Prehospital care</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get the patient to a warm environment as soon as possible.

This would result in worse tissue damage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If prehospital warming is attempted, options include placing the affected area in warm (not hot) water or warming it using body heat (eg, placing frostbitten fingers in the axillae).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not rub frostbitten areas in an attempt to rewarm them; this can cause further tissue damage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid the use of stoves or fires to rewarm frostbitten tissue. Such tissue may be insensate and burns can result [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frostbite/abstract/8,33,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,33,46</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Hospital-based management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the patient has reached the hospital, definitive care consists of rapid rewarming, wound care, efforts to enhance tissue viability, and prevention of complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frostbite/abstract/20,47-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,47-49</a>]. Among patients with severe frostbite, timely diagnosis and treatment is essential to maximize limb and digit salvage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frostbite/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Note that the management of other, more serious conditions, such as severe hypothermia or internal hemorrhage from major trauma, takes priority over the treatment of frostbite. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=accidental-hypothermia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Accidental hypothermia in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-management-of-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial management of trauma in adults&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1943419999\"><span class=\"h3\">Rewarming</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rewarming is most effectively accomplished by immersing the affected area in water heated to 37 to 39&deg;C (98.6 to 102.2&deg;F), ideally in a whirlpool so a steady temperature can be maintained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frostbite/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Gentle active motion of the extremity while rewarming may help. Care should also be taken to avoid trauma to the injured area against the container walls during treatment. Higher temperatures do not warm the injured area appreciably faster and cause the warming process to be much more painful. Dry heat is difficult to regulate and is not recommended.</p><p>Thawing is usually complete when the tissue is red or purple and soft to the touch. This usually takes 15 to 30 minutes. Rewarming of frostbitten tissue may be painful. Appropriate analgesia, generally opioids, should be administered.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3806635444\"><span class=\"h3\">Thrombolysis for severe injury presenting within 24 hours</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because frostbite is associated with vascular thrombosis of affected tissue, administration of intravenous or intra-arterial tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), along with intravenous or intra-arterial heparin or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enoxaparin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">enoxaparin</a>, has been used for therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frostbite/abstract/37,40,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,40,51</a>].</p><p>In patients at high risk for life-altering amputation (eg, multiple digits, proximal amputation), <strong>without contraindications</strong> to the use of tPA, who present within 24 hours of injury, we suggest treatment with intra-arterial tPA plus intra-arterial heparin. In facilities not capable of using intra-arterial tPA, we suggest using intravenous tPA, and intravenous heparin. The use of intravenous tPA and subcutaneous low molecular weight heparin (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enoxaparin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">enoxaparin</a>) is also reasonable at centers that prefer this regimen. Hennepin County Medical Center (Minneapolis, USA) has found that treatment with intravenous tPA and subcutaneous enoxaparin is effective and more easily accomplished than treatment with intra-arterial tPA (see protocol below). Controlled trials comparing intra-arterial and intravenous tPA for the treatment of severe frostbite have yet to be conducted.</p><p>Whenever possible, treatment should be performed at or in consultation with a center experienced in the use of tPA for frostbite.

(See <a href=\"#H1902794625\" class=\"local\">'Prostacyclin therapy for severe injury presenting within 48 hours'</a> below.)</p><p>The degree of frostbite should be assessed using the extent of cyanosis immediately after rewarming, as described in the classification section [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frostbite/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Patients with cyanosis proximal to the interphalangeal joints should be evaluated with technetium scanning or CT angiography. If circulation is absent proximal to the interphalangeal joints, tPA should be given, unless contraindicated.

Vasospasm, especially with reexposure to cold, is common and may be permanent. The severity of complications generally correlates with the severity of the original injury. The sequelae of nonfreezing cold injuries (NFCIs) are similar but often more debilitating than those produced by frostbite [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frostbite/abstract/12,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,66</a>].</p><p>Short-term complications include gangrene and infection of the affected area (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F101022\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101022 \">picture 8</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F101023\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef101023 \">picture 9</a>). Autoamputation may take many weeks to occur. Therapeutic amputation is necessary if deep infection develops before the autoamputation of nonviable tissue. Rarely, acute compartment syndrome may develop and require emergency decompression.</p><p>Throbbing pain that begins two to three days after rewarming may persist for weeks or months, even after nonviable tissue demarcates. Intermittent paresthesias beginning after one week are thought to be due to ischemic neuritis and may last for months. Burning, electric shock sensations may also occur. Hyperhidrosis is common and may be a cause as well as an effect of frostbite.</p><p>Cold exposure is contraindicated for six months after minor injury and for at least 12 months after any significant cold injury. Special precautions to protect previously injured tissue may need to be taken for several years if not indefinitely to prevent further damage. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> below.)</p><p>Longer-term complications include hypersensitivity to the cold; patients remain at increased risk for developing frostbite [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/frostbite/abstract/8,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,67</a>]. Late and long-term or permanent sequelae include scarring, tissue atrophy, arthritis, bony abnormalities, and peripheral neuropathy, including hyper or hypoesthesia of digits with decreased proprioception and chronic pain.
