NS is clinically characterized by the classic triad of congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma, a specific hair shaft abnormality termed trichorrhexis invaginata (&quot;bamboo hair&quot;), and an atopic diathesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/netherton-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>NS is one of the most severe disorders of cornification. Infants typically present at birth with a generalized scaling erythroderma and have a high risk of life-threatening complications, such as hypernatremic dehydration, failure to thrive, and sepsis. In older children, a wide range of allergic manifestations may occur, including severe atopic dermatitis, asthma, hay fever, and markedly elevated serum levels of immunoglobulin E. &#160;</p><p>This topic will review the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of NS.

More than 70 distinct <em>SPINK5</em> mutations specific to an individual or family have been reported. </p><p><em>SPINK5</em> encodes a multidomain serine protein kinase known as lymphoepithelial Kazal type inhibitor (LEKTI). Most mutations, whether small base <span class=\"nowrap\">deletions/insertions,</span> nonsense, or splice site mutations, lead to premature stop codons and protein truncation, resulting in defective expression of LEKTI. </p><p>LEKTI functions as a &quot;super&quot; serine protease inhibitor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/netherton-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Among the proteases it directly inhibits are several kallikreins, especially kallikrein 5 (KLK5). Kallikreins are critical epidermal proteases, important for regulating skin desquamation, inflammation, and maintaining skin barrier integrity. Importantly, the constitutive overactivity of kallikrein 5 (KLK5) and its related peptidases is present in utero; thus, at birth, the epidermal barrier is greatly impaired and there is dramatic upregulation of inflammatory signaling molecules. Specific <em>SPINK5</em> polymorphisms, especially 420Lys (420K), have been associated with atopic dermatitis and atopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/netherton-syndrome/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>].</p><p>LEKTI activity is influenced by local pH; the neutral pH of the deeper aspects of the epidermis stimulates its activity, while the gradient to a more acidic pH in the outer layers of the epidermis impairs its activity, allowing KLK5 (among others) to become active, leading to protein degradation and desquamation of the outer epidermal layers in an organized, regulated fashion. In NS, LEKTI deficiency results in KLK5 activation in all levels of the epidermis, leading to premature degradation of the corneodesmosomal components of the epidermal barrier. This profoundly and continuously degraded epidermal barrier leads to chronic inflammation, superficial desquamation (ichthyosiform erythroderma), and the KLK5-mediated activation of protease-activated receptor-2, which leads to production of a variety of proinflammatory cytokines including thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), a cytokine strongly upregulated in atopic dermatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/netherton-syndrome/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p>TSLP activates Langerhans cells, which induce T cell differentiation into Th2 cells after migration to draining regional lymph nodes. Additional cytokines upregulated in the setting of LEKTI deficiency include macrophage-derived cytokine, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-8, and thymus- and activation-regulated cytokine. In the setting of LEKTI deficiency, these overly activated pathways are constitutive and unremitting. Further emphasizing the importance of KLK5 in the pathogenesis of NS are the findings that KLK5-deficient, LEKTI-deficient mice exhibit a normalized phenotype without the majority of cutaneous and clinical findings present when KLK5 is functional [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/netherton-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. LEKTI is also expressed in the thymus, the importance of which is unknown. </p><p>The constitutive protease activity in NS skin leads not only to degradation of the stratum corneum cell adhesion but also to degradation of secreted lamellar body (LB) protein contents, including two ceramide-generating enzymes (acidic sphingomyelinase and beta-glucocerebrosidase), resulting in a profound barrier defect, which contributes to increased risk of infection. Studies have shown that antimicrobial proteins such as the cathelicidin LL-37, which typically present in normal skin, are reduced in NS. LL-37 is typically loaded in LB to be secreted during cornification of the epidermis. Although LL-37 loading into LB is normal in NS and LB secretion is accelerated, the levels of LL-37 rapidly become undetectable after LB secretion, likely due to degradation by the high levels of active epidermal proteases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/netherton-syndrome/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H269521972\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>NS is characterized by the classic triad of congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma, a specific hair shaft abnormality termed trichorrhexis invaginata, and allergic manifestations with elevated serum levels of immunoglobulin. However, the phenotype of NS may be quite variable among patients and even within families. </p><p>Some patients may present with a milder phenotype, possibly associated with residual expression of lymphoepithelial Kazal type inhibitor (LEKTI) in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/netherton-syndrome/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In other patients, one or more of the classic features may not be present, and changes in the phenotype severity may occur over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/netherton-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Of note, the original patient described by Netherton had significant improvement in her skin and hair findings as she aged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/netherton-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Clear genotype-phenotype correlations have not been identified, although in a small number of Japanese patients a link has been found between LEKTI domain deficiency and clinical manifestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/netherton-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. There are also reports of mutations associated with early lethality or very severe manifestations of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/netherton-syndrome/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2842798364\"><span class=\"h2\">Neonatal findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neonates with NS are often premature and may exhibit diffuse ichthyosiform erythroderma at birth (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F109528\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef109528 \">picture 1</a>). There are reports of NS infants being born with a collodion membrane, although this is not common, if it occurs at all. Hair is usually sparse and grows slowly. Congenital alopecia may be noted. </p><p>Newborns with NS are quite labile in the first few weeks of life. They have a high risk of life-threatening complications, including hypernatremic dehydration and hypothermia due to extensive transepidermal water loss. The risk of infection and sepsis is also elevated. Other complications include severe failure to thrive and enteropathy with villous atrophy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-and-infantile-erythroderma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal and infantile erythroderma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Additionally, as the epidermal barrier is substantially impaired, the risk of transcutaneous absorption is extremely high in these infants. Topical medications should be avoided or used with great caution. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1839034577\"><span class=\"h2\">Cutaneous manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Beyond the neonatal period, the cutaneous findings of NS are variable and tend to improve over time. However, in some patients, a generalized scaling erythroderma may be persistent and at times severe enough to be mistaken for other forms of ichthyosis, such as autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis. </p><p>Most patients evolve with age to a milder cutaneous phenotype, with erythematous patches and scaling mimicking an eczematous eruption such as atopic dermatitis. The erythema may be symmetrical and exhibit patterned shapes. Pustular lesions, which can mimic pustular psoriasis, have also been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/netherton-syndrome/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. </p><p>Eventually, many patients will manifest ichthyosis linearis circumflexa (ILC), which is the distinctive cutaneous feature of NS. ILC usually appears after two years of age and is characterized by migratory serpiginous erythematous plaques with peripheral double-edged scaling (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F87482\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87482 \">picture 2</a>). ILC is variable in severity and extent and waxes and wanes with time. In some patients with proven serine protease inhibitor of Kazal type 5 (<em>SPINK5</em>) gene mutations, ILC is the only clinical manifestation of NS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/netherton-syndrome/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p>Some patients develop during adulthood striking hypertrophic papillomas in the flexures, most commonly in the inguinal folds, gluteal cleft, and groin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/netherton-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Human papillomavirus DNA, including DNA of epidermodysplasia verruciforms-associated beta-papillomavirus, has been detected in some of these lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/netherton-syndrome/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p>There are a few isolated reports of skin malignancies, including multiple basal cell carcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas, occurring at an early age in patients with NS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/netherton-syndrome/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. The overall incidence of this phenomenon is not known.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1236121910\"><span class=\"h2\">Hair abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In many NS patients, the hair is typically lusterless, dry, short, and hard to style or manage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F109572\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef109572 \">picture 3</a>). Some patients with longer hairs may have visible nodes along the hair shafts. </p><p>The pathognomonic finding of trichorrhexis invaginata (TI) of hair and eyebrows (&quot;bamboo hair&quot; or &quot;ball and socket deformity&quot;) may be often detected on trichogram or trichoscopy by one year of age. However, in some patients with genotyped <em>SPINK5</em> mutations, TI may be absent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/netherton-syndrome/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2265879658\" class=\"local\">'Hair examination'</a> below.)</p><p>Other hair shaft defects that may occur in NS include trichorrhexis nodosa (TN) and pili torti. TN is characterized by nodes along the hair shaft that result from separation and fraying of cortical fibers due to disruption of the overlying cuticular cells. Affected hairs may fracture through these weak points in the hair shaft, which appear like two brooms or brushes thrust together end to end.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1407640831\"><span class=\"h2\">Atopic manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with NS have elevated immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels and eosinophilia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/netherton-syndrome/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Manifestations of atopy may become apparent in the neonatal period and increase during childhood. They include atopic dermatitis, which can be severe; food allergies, which are often severe and multiple; hay fever; and asthma. Angioedema and anaphylaxis, especially to foods, have also been reported. The levels of specific IgE to multiple allergens typically increase with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/netherton-syndrome/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3893669320\"><span class=\"h2\">Extracutaneous manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with NS may show a mild developmental delay, short stature and growth hormone deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/netherton-syndrome/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], intellectual disability, recurrent cutaneous and systemic infections, and pancreatic insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/netherton-syndrome/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4210898210\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of NS may be difficult, due to the variability of the clinical presentation and its change over time. A high index of suspicion is required for patients manifesting a mild or incomplete phenotype. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3013019253\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical suspicion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>NS should be suspected in all neonates and infants presenting with ichthyosiform erythroderma, since approximately 20 percent of congenital erythrodermas are thought to result from this disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/netherton-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>In older children, the presence of serpiginous erythematous plaques with typical double-edged scale (ichthyosis linearis circumflexa, [ILC]) on the trunk and extremities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F87482\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87482 \">picture 2</a>) suggests NS. This diagnosis should also be considered in children with recalcitrant atopic eczema that does not respond to standard treatment.</p><p>In both children and adults, the presence of sparse and fragile hair in association with eczematous lesions resembling atopic dermatitis should raise suspicion of NS and prompt careful microscopic or dermoscopic examination of hairs and eyebrows for trichorrhexis invaginata (TI). (See <a href=\"#H2265879658\" class=\"local\">'Hair examination'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1273671674\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Routine histopathologic examination is generally not helpful for the diagnosis of NS. However, it can be helpful to differentiate NS from other disorders that present with similar clinical manifestation. Immunostaining for lymphoepithelial Kazal type inhibitor (LEKTI) may support the diagnosis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2850435534\"><span class=\"h3\">Histopathologic findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Skin biopsies of NS typically exhibit psoriasiform hyperplasia, with skin inflammation and thinning and a diminished granular layer. Additional findings include <span class=\"nowrap\">sub/intracorneal</span> splitting, clear cells in the upper <span class=\"nowrap\">epidermis/stratum</span> corneum, dyskeratosis, a dermal inflammatory infiltrate including neutrophils <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> eosinophils, and vascular dilatation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/netherton-syndrome/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Electron microscopy of NS exhibits findings associated with abnormal differentiation and accelerated desquamation including granular layer diminution, retained nuclei in the stratum corneum, and premature lamellar body (LB) secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/netherton-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1506324574\"><span class=\"h3\">LEKTI immunostaining</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many NS patients exhibit absent LEKTI staining in the epidermis. Some patients with &quot;leaky&quot; mutations allowing slight residual LEKTI expression will exhibit diminution of LEKTI. In contrast, a patchy LEKTI staining may be occasionally seen in patients with atopic dermatitis or psoriasis but not in NS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/netherton-syndrome/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2265879658\"><span class=\"h2\">Hair examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a patient suspected to have NS, the examination of the hair and eyebrows under a microscope (trichogram) or a dermatoscope (trichoscopy) can confirm the presence of TI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/netherton-syndrome/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. In TI, the distal part of the hair shaft collapses into the proximal aspect of the shaft due to a defect in keratinization of the internal root sheath, creating the bamboo-like node which gives the defect its name (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F109572\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef109572 \">picture 3</a>). Due to this structural weakness, the hairs break easily, leaving behind a cup-shaped end to the fractured hair (the so-called &quot;golf-tee&quot; hairs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/netherton-syndrome/abstract/2,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,29</a>]. </p><p>Because in most cases only a small percentage of hairs are affected, the appropriate evaluation of hair in these patients should involve the sampling of numerous hairs from various areas of the scalp. Often hundreds of hairs must be examined to find an example of TI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/netherton-syndrome/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The presence of TI even in a single hair, in association with typical skin findings, is considered sufficient to make the diagnosis of NS. Trichoscopy may aid in this by allowing examination of hairs in vivo on the patient </p><p>Prior to harvesting, the hairs can be rubbed between the fingers to accentuate any underlying defects. In difficult cases, the eyebrows should be examined, as they can exhibit a higher frequency of hair shaft abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/netherton-syndrome/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p>The so-called &quot;matchstick&quot; hairs have been described in the eyebrows of some NS patients. Characterized by short hair shafts with a bulging tip similar to an unstruck match, these hairs are likely equivalent to &quot;golf-tee&quot; scalp hairs and represent hair shafts that have fractured through an area of TI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/netherton-syndrome/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2836562932\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Due to the increasing availability of rapid exome sequencing and mutation analysis, genetic testing for serine protease inhibitor of Kazal type 5 (<em>SPINK5</em>) gene mutations has become the initial test in patients suspected to have NS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/netherton-syndrome/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Genetic testing will identify a germline <em>SPINK5</em> mutation and confirm the diagnosis in approximately 66 to 75 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/netherton-syndrome/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p>Mutational analysis is available from several laboratories in the United States and other countries. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1680233296\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of NS is made based upon the presence of one or more of the following criteria in addition to allergic disease (ie, atopic dermatitis, atopic diathesis, food allergies, hay fever, history of anaphylaxis, elevated IgE levels, eosinophilia):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Typical skin lesions &ndash; Scaling erythroderma, ILC</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Typical hair findings &ndash; TI, &quot;golf-tee&quot; and &quot;matchstick&quot; hairs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of NS in a sibling</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identification of a germline <em>SPINK5</em> mutation by DNA sequencing</p><p/><p>Genetic testing will identify a germline <em>SPINK5</em> mutation and confirm the diagnosis in approximately 66 to 75 percent of cases; in some patients, the diagnosis of NS relies upon clinical suspicion and findings. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3983248614\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In neonates, the cutaneous manifestations of NS may closely resemble other infantile erythrodermas, particularly nonbullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma (CIE) and erythrodermic psoriasis.

It is characterized by congenital erythroderma, hyperhidrosis, and diffuse fine skin scaling. Peeling of the palms and soles beginning in childhood and worsened by immersion in water or occlusion occurs. In contrast with NS, AREI is not associated with a severe alteration of the skin barrier function, atopy, and hair abnormalities.

(See <a href=\"#H2066686047\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The phenotype of NS is variable. Newborns typically present with severe scaly erythroderma and a high risk of life-threatening complications, including hypernatremic dehydration, hypothermia, and sepsis. (See <a href=\"#H2842798364\" class=\"local\">'Neonatal findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients evolve with age to a milder cutaneous phenotype, with erythematous patches and scaling mimicking an eczematous eruption such as atopic dermatitis. Eventually, many develop the characteristic ichthyosis linearis circumflexa (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F87482\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87482 \">picture 2</a>). Hair findings include the trichorrhexis nodosa and the pathognomonic trichorrhexis invaginata.

(See <a href=\"#H1407640831\" class=\"local\">'Atopic manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of NS is based upon the characteristic skin and hair features, presence of elevated serum levels of IgE and atopic manifestations, and the demonstration of germline mutations in the <em>SPINK5</em> gene.
