This trend may reflect size selection, as larger defects remain patent while smaller defects close spontaneously.</p><p/><p>A similar overall prevalence of PFO (26 percent) was noted in a series of 581 subjects &ge;45 years of age who underwent TEE as part of an evaluation of potential stroke risk factors in the community [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patent-foramen-ovale/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, the incidence was stable with increasing age in contrast to the modest decline in the autopsy study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patent-foramen-ovale/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The prevalence of PFO is higher in patients with cryptogenic stroke, particularly those under age 55 years in whom PFO is more likely to play a causal role. Approximately 40 percent of ischemic strokes in adults under 55 are cryptogenic. In the prospective PFO-ASA study of 581 patients with cryptogenic stroke (mean age 42), 37 percent had a PFO alone and another 9 percent had a PFO with an atrial septal aneurysm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patent-foramen-ovale/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. A similar prevalence of PFO (39 percent) was noted among 250 older patients (mean age 59) with cryptogenic stroke in the Patent Foramen Ovale in Cryptogenic Stroke Study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patent-foramen-ovale/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In addition, the patients with cryptogenic stroke had a significantly higher rate of a large PFO compared with patients with a stroke of known cause (20 versus 9.7 percent). (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Cryptogenic stroke'</a> below.)</p><p>Although most individuals with PFO are asymptomatic, a PFO can serve as a pathway for venous to arterial transit of emboli (paradoxical emboli) via right-to-left shunting when the pressure in the right atrium exceeds that in the left atrium. A transient right-to-left gradient is sufficient to induce shunting and commonly occurs in patients without net right-to-left shunting (ie, those with no net shunt or a net left-to-right shunt). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-septal-abnormalities-pfo-asd-and-asa-and-risk-of-cerebral-emboli-in-adults#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Atrial septal abnormalities (PFO, ASD, and ASA) and risk of cerebral emboli in adults&quot;, section on 'Paradoxical emboli'</a>.)</p><p>A transient right-to-left gradient occurs in normal individuals during early ventricular systole and with Valsalva maneuver (eg, straining to defecate, coughing, lifting or pushing heavy objects). Among 148 patients with a PFO in the community-based series cited above, 57 percent had right-to-left shunting at rest, and 92 percent had right-to-left shunting with straining or coughing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patent-foramen-ovale/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EMBRYOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During fetal development, a PFO is required for oxygenated blood to flow from the right to the left atrium. Starting at week four of pregnancy, the septum primum and septum secundum form and fuse in the following sequence (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F77749\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77749 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patent-foramen-ovale/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The septum primum grows from the primordial atrial roof toward the endocardial cushions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The endocardial cushions grow toward each other and then fuse, dividing the atrioventricular canal into right and left sides.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The net effect is creation of the foramen primum. As the septum primum continues to grow toward the endocardial cushions, perforations develop in the septum primum. These perforations then fuse, forming the foramen secundum, which allows oxygenated blood to flow from the right to the left atrium. The foramen primum closes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A second membrane, the septum secundum, grows from the right side of the septum primum. The septum secundum eventually overlaps part of the foramen secundum, forming an incomplete septal partition that becomes the foramen ovale. The remaining septum primum forms a flap-like valve over the foramen ovale.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oxygenated blood from the inferior vena cava crosses the PFO, providing oxygenated blood for the systemic circulation. In contrast, most blood from the superior vena cava flows through the tricuspid valve and enters the right ventricle.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At birth, either or both of two factors contribute to flap closure against the septum secundum: Oxygen filling the alveoli causes the pulmonary arterioles to open, resulting in reductions in right heart pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance; and the increasing amount of blood returning from the pulmonary circulation may raise left atrial pressure.</p><p/><p>Flap fusion is complete by age two in 70 to 75 percent of children, with the remaining 25 to 30 percent having a PFO. Why PFOs fail to close is not known, but familial and genetic factors may be important. This possibility was suggested in a study that compared 62 patients under age 60 with an ischemic stroke and 62 matched controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patent-foramen-ovale/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The prevalence of a PFO in female siblings of patients with a PFO was 77 percent, compared with 25 percent in female siblings of those without a PFO (odds ratio 9.8); there was no such association in men.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSOCIATION WITH OTHER DEFECTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PFO is often associated with other cardiac anomalies, including atrial septal aneurysm and Chiari networks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Atrial septal aneurysm</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An atrial septal aneurysm (ASA) is defined as redundant and mobile interatrial septal tissue in the region of the fossa ovalis with phasic excursion of at least 10 to 15 mm during the cardiorespiratory cycle.

A Chiari network is a more fenestrated mobile structure consisting of a network of filamentous structures and fibers in the right atrium that originate from the region of the Eustachian and thebesian valves at the orifice of the inferior vena cava, with attachments to the upper wall of the right atrium or atrial septum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patent-foramen-ovale/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. A Chiari network is present in 2 to 3 percent of normal hearts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patent-foramen-ovale/abstract/11,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13</a>].

However, a prominent Eustachian valve or Chiari network may maintain an embryonic right atrial flow pattern into adulthood with blood from the inferior vena cava being preferentially directed toward the interatrial septum. As a result, these structures may favor persistence of a PFO and formation of an ASA or flow through a PFO, indirectly facilitating paradoxical embolism.</p><p>The association between Chiari network and PFO was illustrated in a review of 1436 consecutive patients referred for transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patent-foramen-ovale/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A Chiari network was found in 29 patients (2 percent): 24 (83 percent) had a PFO and seven (24 percent) had an ASA.

The most important potential manifestation is ischemic stroke due to a paradoxical embolism. The following is a brief summary, since most of these manifestations are discussed in detail separately.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Cryptogenic stroke</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cryptogenic stroke, which accounts for approximately 20 to 40 percent of ischemic strokes, is defined as a stroke that occurs in the absence of an identified cardioembolic or large vessel source and with a distribution that is not consistent with small vessel disease. Most of these strokes are embolic. There is an increased prevalence of PFO in patients who have had a cryptogenic stroke; thus, paradoxical embolism via PFO is likely one mechanism for stroke in this population. On the other hand, there is evidence that PFO alone is not associated with an increased risk of recurrent stroke.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence and pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">TEE, TTE, and ICE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among the ultrasound methods for detection of right-to-left shunts, only TEE and ICE enable visualization of the site of the shunt (eg, PFO, atrial septal defect [ASD], or pulmonary arteriovenous malformation) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F78654\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef78654 \">movie 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56656\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef56656 \">movie 2</a>). Echocardiography (TTE or TEE) can also detect other cardiac abnormalities associated with embolic events such as ASA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F65962\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef65962 \">movie 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F50099\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef50099 \">movie 4</a>), intracardiac mass (eg, vegetation, tumor, or thrombus). TEE is generally more sensitive than TTE for identifying potential sources of cardiac embolus including ASA, vegetations, atrial mass, or thrombus and thoracic aortic plaque. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=echocardiography-in-detection-of-cardiac-and-aortic-sources-of-systemic-embolism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Echocardiography in detection of cardiac and aortic sources of systemic embolism&quot;</a>.)</p><p>TEE and ICE enable visualization of the flap of the atrial septum covering the foramen ovale as well as passage of agitated saline contrast through the foramen. Contrast that has passed through a pulmonary arteriovenous malformation may be visualized entering the left atrium via the pulmonary veins. In addition, color Doppler imaging on TEE or ICE (and occasionally on TTE) may reveal flow through a PFO at rest <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> with maneuvers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patent-foramen-ovale/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. In a small series, PFO detection by contrast and color Doppler TEE correlated well with autopsy findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patent-foramen-ovale/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>The timing of the appearance of agitated saline contrast (bubbles) in the left heart on echocardiography (TTE, ICE, or TEE) can help distinguish intracardiac shunting (via PFO or ASD) from pulmonary arteriovenous shunting. Early contrast appearance in the left heart (within three beats of contrast appearance in the right heart) suggests intracardiac shunting, while late shunting (after three to five beats) is more consistent with pulmonary arteriovenous shunting. However, the data supporting this timing rule are limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patent-foramen-ovale/abstract/44-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-46</a>] and exceptions occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patent-foramen-ovale/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>].</p><p>The relative efficacy of TTE and TEE has been evaluated in a number of comparative studies.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In general, TEE and ICE have been found to be more sensitive than TTE for PFO detection, although the reported sensitivity of TEE has varied widely (11 to 85 percent of shunts detected by TEE) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patent-foramen-ovale/abstract/28-30,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30,48</a>]. Variation in the sensitivity of TTE is likely related to variation in image quality.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some later studies have reported that TTE with second harmonic imaging (routinely employed using newer echocardiography systems) had greater sensitivity than TEE for shunt detection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patent-foramen-ovale/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>]. Potential causes of reduced sensitivity of TEE include ineffective Valsalva maneuver in sedated patients with the TEE probe interfering with glottic closure and reduced right atrial pressures due to fasting and sedation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patent-foramen-ovale/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. A limitation of these studies is that a positive TTE or TEE served as the standard for shunt detection, so the rate of false positive results cannot be ascertained.</p><p/><p>A separate concern is reduction in sensitivity of echocardiography when images are stored digitally rather than on analog videotape. Although digital acquisition and storage of echocardiographic images are generally recommended by the American Society of Echocardiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patent-foramen-ovale/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>], digital data compression by the approved Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) method may result in loss of some visual information. A study comparing digital TTE and analog TTE results found that digital TTE had poor sensitivity for detection of right to left shunts as compared with analog TTE (50, 63, and 39 percent for rest, Valsalva, and late shunts, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patent-foramen-ovale/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Longer recorded clip length (&ge;13 seconds) was associated with only modest improvement in sensitivity (50, 67, and 46 percent, respectively).</p><p>Other factors that influence the sensitivity of echocardiography for shunt detection are the site of injection of agitated saline contrast (greater sensitivity with femoral rather than brachial venous injection) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patent-foramen-ovale/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>] and the number of bubbles (typically three) required for test positivity.</p><p>In summary, TEE with contrast at rest, with cough, and following Valsalva is generally considered the most definitive diagnostic test, although second harmonic TTE in patients with good acoustic windows may offer equal or greater sensitivity. Among those with cryptogenic stroke or other clinical indication to evaluate for PFO, we suggest starting with TTE, with TEE performed if TTE is negative or nondiagnostic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Transmitral Doppler</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A preliminary study of 44 patients evaluated the test performance of TMD echocardiography with agitated saline contrast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patent-foramen-ovale/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The sensitivity and specificity of TMD were 100 and 96 percent when compared with TEE; measures of bubble passage by this technique correlated well with the PFO opening diameter measured with TEE. The role of TMD is uncertain since clinical experience is limited.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Transcranial Doppler</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, TCD is a potential alternative to TEE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patent-foramen-ovale/abstract/30,33-37,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,33-37,39</a>]. TCD has advantages compared with TEE of being noninvasive and easy to perform at the bedside. On the other hand, TCD can only detect a right-to-left shunt, not the location of the shunt.</p><p>TCD is performed by placing a probe against the side of the skull just above the zygomatic arch (ie, over the middle cerebral artery). A contrast agent (typically agitated saline) is injected and Doppler ultrasonography is performed at baseline and after a Valsalva maneuver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patent-foramen-ovale/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=contrast-echocardiography-contrast-agents-safety-and-imaging-technique\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Contrast echocardiography: Contrast agents, safety, and imaging technique&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although early studies suggested that TCD was highly specific but less sensitive than TEE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patent-foramen-ovale/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>], later studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patent-foramen-ovale/abstract/32,34,35,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,34,35,38</a>] indicated that these studies are comparable for detection of right-to-left shunts, as concluded in a 2004 report from the American Academy of Neurology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patent-foramen-ovale/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. However, TEE and ICE are considered a better test because it also provides anatomic information about the site and size of the shunt and possible presence of an atrial septal aneurysm and other possible causes of stroke such as aortic atherosclerosis, intracardiac masses, and infective endocarditis. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Atrial septal aneurysm'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=embolism-from-aortic-plaque-thromboembolism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Embolism from aortic plaque: Thromboembolism&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=embolism-from-atherosclerotic-plaque-atheroembolism-cholesterol-crystal-embolism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Embolism from atherosclerotic plaque: Atheroembolism (cholesterol crystal embolism)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-adults-with-suspected-native-valve-endocarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and evaluation of adults with suspected native valve endocarditis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Safety</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although intravenous administration of agitated saline contrast for ultrasound detection of shunts has generally been considered safe, case reports suggest that cerebral ischemic events may rarely result from passage of bubbles into the systemic circulation (via an intracardiac shunt or pulmonary arteriovenous malformation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patent-foramen-ovale/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>]. Although data on techniques to enhance safety are lacking, suggestions include thorough agitation to minimize bubble size, vertical position of the injecting syringe to aid withholding of large bubbles and avoidance of additional contrast injections once a large shunt has been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/patent-foramen-ovale/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>].</p><p>The safety of TEE is discussed separately.
