The treatment of these sexually transmitted infections (STIs) has evolved over the years, mainly due to the emergence of antibiotic resistance. </p><p>Urogenital, anogenital, pharyngeal, and ocular gonococcal infections that are not associated with bacteremic or ascending spread of the pathogen to other organs are considered uncomplicated. This topic will address the treatment of these gonococcal infections, with a focus on urogenital infections. The discussion in this topic is largely consistent with the 2015 sexually transmitted disease (STD) treatment guidelines from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-uncomplicated-neisseria-gonorrhoeae-infections/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of gonorrhea are discussed elsewhere.

Single-dose therapy decreases the reliance on patient adherence, which can negatively affect eradication rates and increase the risk of drug resistance. Because of progressive development of drug resistance to various classes of antibiotics, at present, only one drug, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a>, meets these strict treatment efficacy goals with single-dose therapy, few adverse effects, and relatively low rates of drug resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-uncomplicated-neisseria-gonorrhoeae-infections/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, decreasing susceptibility to this agent over time threatens the ability to effectively treat <em>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</em> and has prompted recommendations for use of a combination therapy to treat gonococcal infections. <strong>This recommendation has been a major change in the management of a common disease, although many health care providers remain unaware of it. </strong>(See <a href=\"#H7889004\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotic resistance'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1115841\" class=\"local\">'Approach to treatment'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1115804\"><span class=\"h2\">Copathogens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The selection of antibiotics for the treatment of gonorrhea must also include the possibility of copathogens, such as <em>Chlamydia trachomatis </em>and<em> Mycoplasma genitalium</em>, which can cause cervicitis in women and urethritis in men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-uncomplicated-neisseria-gonorrhoeae-infections/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. Some epidemiologic surveys have shown a coinfection rate for <em>C. trachomatis</em> of up to 46 percent among men and women with gonorrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-uncomplicated-neisseria-gonorrhoeae-infections/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Subsequently, gonococcal infections were treated with penicillins, but by 1989, &gt;5 percent of cases of gonorrhea were caused by strains that produced a plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase and &gt;17 percent were associated with chromosomally-mediated resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-uncomplicated-neisseria-gonorrhoeae-infections/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> has uniformly developed increasing minimum inhibitory concentrations (ie, decreasing susceptibility) to antibiotics employed for treatment, followed by frank resistance, thus progressively reducing available therapeutic options [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-uncomplicated-neisseria-gonorrhoeae-infections/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Most of the data on gonococcal drug resistance is inferred through in vitro susceptibility data and epidemiologic surveys, rather than through clinical trials demonstrating increased treatment failure rates. In the United States, trends in drug resistance have been monitored by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-sponsored Gonococcal Isolate Sensitivity Project (GISP), which was created in 1986 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-uncomplicated-neisseria-gonorrhoeae-infections/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Similar programs have been collecting data on <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> antimicrobial resistance in other regions of the world [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-uncomplicated-neisseria-gonorrhoeae-infections/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. Such surveillance programs have demonstrated increased resistance worldwide to multiple classes of antibiotics, including penicillins, tetracyclines, macrolides, and fluoroquinolones, with documented cross-resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-uncomplicated-neisseria-gonorrhoeae-infections/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. An especially alarming trend in <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> drug resistance has been the progressive decrease in susceptibility to the cephalosporins. </p><p>The emerging threat of antimicrobial-resistant gonorrhea is more evident among men who have sex with men (MSM) than among men who have sex exclusively with women (MSW). Surveillance data from GISP which included more than 34,000 episodes of symptomatic gonorrhea found that isolates from MSM were significantly more likely to demonstrate antimicrobial resistance to all the antibiotic classes noted above, including cephalosporins, than isolates from MSW [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-uncomplicated-neisseria-gonorrhoeae-infections/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p>In the setting of these trends, there has been renewed interest in other antibiotic classes, such as the aminoglycosides, which have been used for <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> in some regions without evidence of increasing resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-uncomplicated-neisseria-gonorrhoeae-infections/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

However, trends in increasing mean minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> for both agents, indicating decreasing susceptibility, have been reported worldwide and have led to changes in the recommendations for use of these agents.

However, surveillance uses lower breakpoints to determine decreasing susceptibility in order to increase the sensitivity for detecting trends in emerging resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-uncomplicated-neisseria-gonorrhoeae-infections/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H365932\"><span class=\"h3\">Cefixime</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surveillance of <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> samples in the United States demonstrates that the percentage of isolates with elevated <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefixime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefixime</a> MICs (&ge;0.25 <span class=\"nowrap\">micrograms/mL)</span> increased from 0.1 percent in 2006 to 1.4 percent in 2010, then declined to 0.5 percent in 2015 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-uncomplicated-neisseria-gonorrhoeae-infections/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Among 23 European countries reporting on cefixime susceptibility in the World Health Organization Gonococcal Surveillance Programme (GASP), four countries (Belgium, Denmark, Greece, and Norway) reported resistance rates &ge;5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-uncomplicated-neisseria-gonorrhoeae-infections/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Although no confirmed treatment failures with cefixime have been reported in the United States as of 2017, such failures have been reported in Canada, Europe, and Japan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-uncomplicated-neisseria-gonorrhoeae-infections/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>]. Furthermore, in a retrospective study of patients treated for culture-confirmed <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> infection with a single oral dose of cefixime 400 mg at a Canadian clinic, 13 of 133 patients who returned for a test of cure were again culture positive, and nine (6.8 percent) were considered treatment failures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-uncomplicated-neisseria-gonorrhoeae-infections/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. With regards to location of infection, clinical failure occurred in 4 of 76 urethral, 2 of 7 pharyngeal, and 3 of 39 rectal infections (5.3, 28.6, and 7.7 percent, respectively). Although the possibility that some of these cases represented reinfection instead of treatment failure cannot be definitively excluded, these data highlight the increasing concern of the inadequacy of cefixime for gonococcal infections.</p><p>In light of domestic MIC trends and international treatment failures, the CDC recommends that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefixime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefixime</a> should not be a preferred agent for the treatment of gonorrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-uncomplicated-neisseria-gonorrhoeae-infections/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

However, because of trends in antimicrobial resistance and the lack of new, effective antimicrobials in advanced product development for use in the treatment of gonorrhea, the CDC recommends combination therapy for suspected or documented gonorrhea with ceftriaxone plus either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a>, regardless of chlamydial coinfection status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-uncomplicated-neisseria-gonorrhoeae-infections/abstract/1,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,24</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H278540\" class=\"local\">'Preferred regimen for urogenital infection'</a> above.)</p><p>The rationale for recommending dual therapy is mainly related to concerns regarding the early emergence of cephalosporin resistance and the paucity of alternative first-line agents. Although there are no clinical data to suggest that dual therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> decreases the emergence of resistance, some experts have suggested that a theoretical basis for dual therapy against <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> could be extrapolated from evidence from other pathogens that demonstrates lower rates of resistance with the use of agents that act upon different molecular targets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-uncomplicated-neisseria-gonorrhoeae-infections/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, treatment failure of a pharyngeal infection following dual therapy has been reported in a heterosexual man from the United Kingdom who initially had both urogenital and pharyngeal infection; decreased susceptibility to ceftriaxone and azithromycin was subsequently detected in the post-treatment pharyngeal isolate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-uncomplicated-neisseria-gonorrhoeae-infections/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>Additionally, there are real concerns regarding the efficacy of the second agent used (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a>) against gonococcal isolates in the event that resistance renders the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a> ineffective. The prevalence of resistance to doxycycline is substantial and to azithromycin is increasing, and such trends may considerably limit the utility of these agents.

However, in light of emerging antibiotic resistance data and because treatment failure has significant public health implications related to ongoing transmission of infection, ceftriaxone as a single agent for gonococcal infections <strong>is no longer recommended</strong>. Instead, ceftriaxone should be administered in combination with another agent. (See <a href=\"#H1115932\" class=\"local\">'Rationale for dual therapy'</a> above.)</p><p>Earlier studies that predated the emergence of decreasing susceptibility to the cephalosporins had suggested that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a> dosed intramuscularly at either 125 mg or 250 mg resulted in microbiologic cure in 99 percent of uncomplicated urogenital and anorectal infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-uncomplicated-neisseria-gonorrhoeae-infections/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In a meta-analysis of trials comparing cephalosporins and other agents for treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhea, higher cure rates were reported with ceftriaxone 250 mg than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefixime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefixime</a> 400 mg (OR 1.77, 95% CI 1.11-2.8) with equivalent side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-uncomplicated-neisseria-gonorrhoeae-infections/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Thus, extensive data and clinical experience indicate that ceftriaxone is safe and effective for the treatment of uncomplicated gonorrhea at urogenital and anorectal sites and support its use as the preferred agent (in combination with a second agent) despite the need for parenteral administration. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4238252706\"><span class=\"h3\">Dosing of ceftriaxone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States, the CDC recommended dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a> is 250 mg, which is an increase from 125 mg dose recommended prior to 2011 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-uncomplicated-neisseria-gonorrhoeae-infections/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This recommendation was based on scattered reports of cephalosporin treatment failures and the increasing identification of isolates with decreased susceptibility to cephalosporins (eg, increased minimal inhibitory concentration [MICs]) (see <a href=\"#H77502526\" class=\"local\">'Cephalosporins'</a> above). In addition, pharyngeal infection, which is often asymptomatic and may accompany infection at other sites, is more difficult to eradicate than gonococcal infections at other sites and may serve as a reservoir of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-uncomplicated-neisseria-gonorrhoeae-infections/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. A cure rate for pharyngeal gonorrhea of 98 percent has been documented among patients who received a 250 mg dose of ceftriaxone, thus supporting the use of this dosage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-uncomplicated-neisseria-gonorrhoeae-infections/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].

Culture for test of cure also allows for susceptibility testing.

However, all specimens except for one rectal sample at 14 days were culture negative, and one case was a documented reinfection.

Isolates should also be submitted to CDC for susceptibility testing.</p><p>The optimal management of suspected treatment failure is uncertain, as there are minimal data evaluating efficacy of different regimens in this situation. Since many suspected treatment failures are reinfections, the CDC recommends treatment with the same regimen as recommended for initial therapy (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a> 250 mg IM and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> 1 gram orally, each as a single dose) after obtaining specimens for culture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-uncomplicated-neisseria-gonorrhoeae-infections/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. If the suspected failure followed treatment with an oral cephalosporin and azithromycin, retreatment with ceftriaxone 250 mg IM and azithromycin 2 gram orally, each as a single dose, is recommended. Higher antibiotic doses may be able to overcome moderately elevated minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) in some cases of treatment failure.

Azithromycin is given orally as a single dose (1 g) while doxycycline is given twice daily for seven days (100 mg). Azithromycin and doxycycline also have activity against chlamydia, which is a common copathogen. (See <a href=\"#H1115841\" class=\"local\">'Approach to treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-chlamydia-trachomatis-infection#H5622559\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of Chlamydia trachomatis infection&quot;, section on 'Treatment of uncomplicated genital chlamydia infection'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pharyngeal infections may be somewhat more difficult to cure and may serve as an important reservoir of infection. (See <a href=\"#H7889046\" class=\"local\">'Pharyngeal infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnant women with uncomplicated gonorrheal infection should be treated with dual therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> since <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> should be avoided during pregnancy. In addition to retesting three months following therapy, pregnant women at continued high risk for gonococcal infection should be retested during the third trimester. (See <a href=\"#H279639\" class=\"local\">'Pregnant women'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of the penicillin allergic patient depends upon the clinical suspicion of true allergy and the type of the allergy (eg, morbilliform rash versus IgE-mediated reactions, such as urticaria). (See <a href=\"#H279612\" class=\"local\">'Penicillin allergic patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persons diagnosed with a sexually transmitted infection are at high risk for HIV infection and should be offered testing. (See <a href=\"#H4144118\" class=\"local\">'HIV counseling and testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who finish a recommended regimen for treatment of uncomplicated gonorrheal infections do not need to return for a test of cure. A test of cure with culture, if available, is performed seven days following therapy for any patient who receives an alternate regimen (eg, a cefixime-based regimen) for oropharyngeal gonococcal infection. Patients who continue to be symptomatic should be re-evaluated for treatment failure or other sexually transmitted infections. All patients with documented gonococcal infection should be retested three months following treatment to evaluate for reinfection. (See <a href=\"#H22560004\" class=\"local\">'Patient follow-up'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7889102\" class=\"local\">'Postgonococcal urethritis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment failure is suspected in individuals with persistent or recurrent symptoms soon (eg, three to five days) after completing therapy for a documented gonococcal infection. If reinfection is unlikely, relevant specimens (eg, urethral, oropharyngeal, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> rectal samples depending on exposure) should be submitted for culture and NAAT for <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em> and isolates sent for susceptibility testing. These cases should also be reported to governmental public health agencies. (See <a href=\"#H2836827\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring for and managing treatment failure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of sexual partners is essential for preventing reinfection and controlling the spread of <em>N. gonorrhoeae</em>. For sex partners of patients with documented gonococcal infection, we suggest not routinely employing expedited partner therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Instead, we prefer evaluation and management through traditional strategies of public health or patient notification. However, if a heterosexual partner cannot be evaluated and managed in this manner, delivery of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefixime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefixime</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> through expedited partner therapy is a reasonable approach.
