In people with paradoxical vocal fold motion, also called PVFM, the vocal cords either stay shut or open only a little (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F95901\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef95901 \">figure 1</a>). This makes it hard to breathe and causes the other symptoms of PVFM.</p><p>The vocal cord problem that causes the symptoms of PVFM doesn't happen all the time. It can happen in response to exercise, or after someone has had a breathing tube put in. Sometimes it just happens on its own, too.</p><p>Another term for PVFM is &quot;vocal cord dysfunction.&quot; (The vocal cords and vocal folds are the same thing.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91122603\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of PVFM?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wheezing or making a whistling sound when you breathe</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Throat tightness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A feeling that you are choking</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble speaking</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cough</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91122616\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes, if you have symptoms of PVFM, see your doctor or nurse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91122629\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for PVFM?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes, there is a test. Asthma and PVFM cause many of the same symptoms, so if your doctor suspects you have PVFM, he or she will first do breathing tests to check you for asthma. If the doctor still suspects PVFM, he or she can put a small tube down your throat with a camera and light on the end. This tube, called a laryngoscope, allows the doctor to look at your vocal cords and see if they move normally. It's possible you'll need other tests to make sure something else is not going on, but this is the main test for PVFM.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91122642\"><span class=\"h1\">How is PVFM treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The vocal cord problem that causes the symptoms of PVFM usually goes away on its own. While it is going on, doctors might do 1 or more of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Give you oxygen to breathe</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ask you to pant (because this can sometimes make the vocal cords open up)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Put you on a device called &quot;continuous positive airway pressure,&quot; or CPAP, which gently blows air into your nose</p><p/><p>If these treatments don't work and you are having a very hard time breathing, doctors can do other things, such as put a tube down your throat to help you breathe. But treatments like those are not usually needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91122655\"><span class=\"h1\">Can PVFM be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes, with the right treatment, PVFM can be prevented. Treatment involves working with a speech and language pathologist, or &quot;SLP&quot; for short. An SLP can teach you special ways to breathe and talk so that your vocal cords don't close up on you. He or she can also teach you special ways to relax and breathe when you are having problems, so that you can start breathing normally again as quickly as possible.</p><p>Sometimes it is hard to believe that you have PVFM instead of asthma, because PVFM and asthma have many of the same symptoms and can be hard to tell apart. In fact, many people with PVFM are diagnosed with asthma first by mistake.</p><p>The problem is, if you don't actually have asthma, medicines for asthma are not much help. If PFVM and not asthma is causing your symptoms, try to accept your new diagnosis and learn how to manage it. In time, the new treatment will work much better than the treatments for asthma.</p><p>Your doctor or nurse might also prescribe treatment for acid reflux in case reflux is bothering your vocal cords. Postnasal drip from allergies or sinus problems can also bother the vocal cords, so you might need treatment for these. Sometimes, people can have both PVFM and asthma and need treatment for both problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H91122668\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=asthma-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Asthma in adults (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
