In addition to physiologic changes and medical issues that may arise during this period, health care providers should be aware of the psychological needs of the postpartum mother and sensitive to cultural differences that surround childbirth, which may involve eating particular foods and restricting certain activities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-postpartum-period-physiology-complications-and-maternal-care/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This topic will provide an overview of issues related to the postpartum period. Many of the specific issues are discussed in detail in separate topics.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2604369366\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION OF THE POSTPARTUM PERIOD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is consensus that the postpartum period begins upon delivery of the infant. The end is less well defined but is often considered the six to eight weeks after delivery because the effects of pregnancy on many systems have largely returned to the prepregnancy state. However, all organ systems do not return to baseline within this period, and the return to baseline is not necessarily linear over time. For this reason, some authors describe women as postpartum for as long as 12 months after delivery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTPARTUM FINDINGS AND CHANGES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Shivering</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postpartum shivering or chills are observed in 25 to 50 percent of women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-postpartum-period-physiology-complications-and-maternal-care/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Shivering usually starts 1 to 30 minutes postdelivery and lasts for 2 to 60 minutes. The cause is not known; it may be a response to a fall in body temperature following labor, fetal-maternal bleeding, micro-amniotic emboli, placental separation, anesthesia, bacteremia, or administration of certain drugs (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3439307031\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment is supportive with warm blankets <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> warm air. Anesthesia-related shivering can be treated pharmacologically. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adverse-effects-of-neuraxial-analgesia-and-anesthesia-for-obstetrics#H885147716\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adverse effects of neuraxial analgesia and anesthesia for obstetrics&quot;, section on 'Shivering'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Uterine involution</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H722333968\"><span class=\"h3\">Signs and symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immediately after delivery of the placenta, the uterus begins to return to its nonpregnant size and condition, a process termed uterine involution. Contraction of the interlacing myometrial muscle bundles constricts the intramyometrial vessels and impedes blood flow, which is the major mechanism preventing hemorrhage at the placental site. Myometrial retraction (brachystasis) is a unique characteristic of the uterine muscle that enables it to maintain its shortened length following successive contractions. In addition, large vessels at the placental site thrombose, which is a secondary hemostatic mechanism for preventing blood loss. Inadequate myometrial contraction will result in atony (ie, a soft, boggy uterus), which is the most common cause of early postpartum hemorrhage. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-postpartum-hemorrhage#H100823213\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of postpartum hemorrhage&quot;, section on 'Focal or diffuse atony'</a>.)</p><p>Immediately after delivery, the fundus is normally firm, nontender, globular, and located midway between the symphysis pubis and umbilicus. In the next 12 hours, it rises to just above or below the umbilicus, then recedes by approximately 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/day</span> to again lie midway between the symphysis pubis and umbilicus by the end of the first postpartum week. It is not palpable abdominally by two weeks postpartum and attains its normal nonpregnant size by six to eight weeks postpartum. This process is modestly affected by predelivery uterine overdistention, multiparity, and cesarean delivery (the uterus is slightly larger in these cases), and by breastfeeding (the uterus is slightly smaller in women who are breastfeeding) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-postpartum-period-physiology-complications-and-maternal-care/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The weight of the uterus decreases from approximately 1000 g immediately postpartum to 60 g six to eight weeks later.</p><p>Although assessment of uterine size is routinely performed in the early postnatal period, there is no evidence that uterine size is predictive of complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-postpartum-period-physiology-complications-and-maternal-care/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1200898081\"><span class=\"h3\">Findings on ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The normal sonographic appearance of the postpartum uterus is illustrated by the following representative studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a prospective, longitudinal study that performed ultrasound examinations on postpartum days 1, 3, 7, 14, 28, and 56 in 42 women with uncomplicated vaginal term deliveries, the uterus was most often empty in the early puerperium (days 1 and 3), fluid and debris were seen in the entire cavity in the middle part of the puerperium (day 14), while the late puerperium (days 28 and 56) was characterized by an empty cavity that appeared as a thin white line [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-postpartum-period-physiology-complications-and-maternal-care/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Endometrial gas was occasionally seen. Gas in the uterine cavity may be seen after cesarean delivery or after manual evacuation of the placenta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-postpartum-period-physiology-complications-and-maternal-care/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another study of 40 women who underwent ultrasound examination 48 hours after vaginal delivery, 16 had intrauterine echogenic material, which was not associated with the amount or duration of bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-postpartum-period-physiology-complications-and-maternal-care/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Others have made similar observations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-postpartum-period-physiology-complications-and-maternal-care/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>].</p><p/><p>These observations suggest that the presence of echogenic material can be a normal finding and need not change clinical management in patients who do not have heavy bleeding or signs of uterine infection. However, in women with fever <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bleeding, an echogenic mass may represent retained products of conception (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F73717\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef73717 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-postpartum-period-physiology-complications-and-maternal-care/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondary-late-postpartum-hemorrhage#H4267008826\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondary (late) postpartum hemorrhage&quot;, section on 'Retained products of conception'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H629529854\"><span class=\"h2\">Lochia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The basal portion of the decidua remains after the placenta separates. This decidua divides into two layers: The superficial layer is shed and the deep layer regenerates new endometrium, which covers the entire endometrial cavity by the 16<sup>th</sup> postpartum day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-postpartum-period-physiology-complications-and-maternal-care/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Normal shedding of blood and decidua is referred to as lochia rubra <span class=\"nowrap\">(red/red-brown)</span> and lasts for the first few days following delivery. Vaginal discharge then becomes increasingly watery, called lochia serosa (pinkish brown), which lasts for two to three weeks. Ultimately, the discharge turns yellowish white, the lochia alba. Microscopically, lochia consists of serous exudate, erythrocytes, leukocytes, decidua, epithelial cells, and bacteria.</p><p>The total volume of postpartum lochial secretion is 200 to 500 mL, which is discharged over a mean duration of one month [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-postpartum-period-physiology-complications-and-maternal-care/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Up to 15 percent of women continue to pass lochia for six to eight weeks, the time of the standard postpartum visit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-postpartum-period-physiology-complications-and-maternal-care/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The duration of lochia does not appear to be related to lactation or to the use of either estrogen-containing or progesterone-only contraceptives, but women with bleeding diatheses may be prone to longer duration of passing lochia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-postpartum-period-physiology-complications-and-maternal-care/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Cervix</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After delivery, the cervix is soft and floppy. Small lacerations can be found at the margins of the external os. The cervix remains 2 to 3 cm dilated for the first few postpartum days and is less than 1 cm dilated at one week. The external os never resumes its pregravid shape; the small, smooth, regular circular opening of the nulligravida becomes a large, transverse, stellate slit after childbirth (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F72718\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72718 \">figure 1</a>). Histologically, the cervix does not return to baseline for up to three to four months after delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-postpartum-period-physiology-complications-and-maternal-care/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Vagina and vulva</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The vagina is capacious and smooth immediately after delivery. It slowly contracts, but not to its nulligravid size; rugae are restored in the third week as edema and vascularity subside. The hymen is replaced by multiple tags of tissue called the carunculae hymenales (myrtiformes). Fascial stretching and trauma during childbirth result in pelvic muscle relaxation, which may not return to the pregravid state. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-incontinence-and-pelvic-organ-prolapse-associated-with-pregnancy-and-childbirth\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinary incontinence and pelvic organ prolapse associated with pregnancy and childbirth&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Abdominal wall</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The abdominal wall is lax postpartum but regains most, if not all, of its normal muscular tone over several weeks; however, separation (diastasis) of the rectus abdominis muscles may persist. Long-term sequelae may include abdominal discomfort and cosmetic issues. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rectus-abdominis-diastasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rectus abdominis diastasis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Reproductive hormones</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The fall and disappearance of the beta-subunit of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) postpartum follows a biexponential curve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-postpartum-period-physiology-complications-and-maternal-care/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. The median time of elimination was 12 days in pregnant women who underwent peripartum hysterectomy in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-postpartum-period-physiology-complications-and-maternal-care/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, the duration is longer when the uterus is left in situ: hCG values typically return to normal nonpregnant levels two to four weeks after term delivery but can take longer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-postpartum-period-physiology-complications-and-maternal-care/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The most serious concern in women with rising hCG levels postpartum is gestational trophoblastic disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydatidiform-mole-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hydatidiform mole: Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'hCG'</a>.)</p><p>Gonadotropins and sex steroids are at low levels for the first two to three weeks postpartum. In studies using urinary pregnanediol levels to measure ovulation in nonlactating women, the mean return of menstruation following delivery ranged from 45 to 64 days postpartum and the mean time to ovulation ranged from 45 to 94 days, but occurred as early as 25 days postpartum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-postpartum-period-physiology-complications-and-maternal-care/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Seventy percent of women will menstruate by the 12<sup>th</sup> postpartum week, and 20 to 71 percent of first menstruations are preceded by ovulation, and thus the cycle is potentially fertile.</p><p>Some women report hot flashes in the postpartum period, with resolution over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-postpartum-period-physiology-complications-and-maternal-care/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The cause is unknown but may be due to thermoregulatory dysfunction, initiated at the level of the hypothalamus by estrogen withdrawal after delivery of the placenta. In addition, the initial hyperprolactinemic state associated with breastfeeding depresses estrogen production. The plasma prolactin concentration increases rapidly during suckling and is mediated through stimulation of nerve endings in the nipple-areolar complex.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1274591175\"><span class=\"h3\">Effect of breastfeeding on ovulatory hormones</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The degree to which breastfeeding suppresses gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion is modulated by the intensity of the breastfeeding and maternal nutritional status and body mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-postpartum-period-physiology-complications-and-maternal-care/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. Lactation represents a metabolic energy burden. When nutrition is adequate and basal body mass and composition are normal, intensive lactation is less likely to result in prolonged suppression of GnRH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-postpartum-period-physiology-complications-and-maternal-care/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. When nutrition is inadequate to meet the energy demands of both daily living and lactation, GnRH suppression is more likely to persist for an extended time period, resulting in prolonged oligo- or anovulation.</p><p>During exclusive breastfeeding, approximately 40 percent of women will remain amenorrheic at six months postpartum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-postpartum-period-physiology-complications-and-maternal-care/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In observational studies performed in the United Arab Emirates, the median duration of postpartum amenorrhea in breastfeeding women was seven months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-postpartum-period-physiology-complications-and-maternal-care/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Amenorrhea during breastfeeding may be related, in part, to higher prolactin levels compared with women who become ovulatory while breastfeeding, since prolactin inhibits pulsatile GnRH release from the hypothalamus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-postpartum-period-physiology-complications-and-maternal-care/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In one study, some women who exclusively breastfed (at least six episodes of <span class=\"nowrap\">suckling/day</span> totalling more than 80 minutes in 24 hours) had elevated basal prolactin levels and amenorrhea for one year or more after delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-postpartum-period-physiology-complications-and-maternal-care/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>The overall physiology of lactation and lactational amenorrhea are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-of-lactation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology of lactation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postpartum-contraception-initiation-and-methods#H2517339107\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postpartum contraception: Initiation and methods&quot;, section on 'Impact of lactation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3894215431\"><span class=\"h2\">Breast engorgement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Breast engorgement results in breast fullness and firmness, which is accompanied by pain and tenderness. The affected area varies from primarily areolar involvement in some mothers, more peripheral involvement in others, and, in some mothers, both peripheral and areolar involvement. Primary engorgement is due to interstitial edema and onset of copious milk production. It typically occurs between 24 and 72 hours postpartum, with a normal range of one to seven days; peak symptomatology averages three to five days postpartum. Secondary engorgement typically occurs later if the mother's milk supply exceeds the amount of milk removed by her infant.</p><p>Breast engorgement is uncomfortable and may give rise to a mild temperature elevation for a short time; however, any fever should prompt an investigation to rule out an infectious source (see <a href=\"#H183549243\" class=\"local\">'Fever/infection/wound complications'</a> below). The condition spontaneously resolves over a few days, but supportive care (warm compresses or a warm shower before feeding to enhance let-down and facilitate milk removal, cool compresses after or between feedings, mild analgesics such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> [paracetamol] or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a>) is appropriate and reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=common-problems-of-breastfeeding-and-weaning#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Common problems of breastfeeding and weaning&quot;, section on 'Engorgement'</a>.)</p><p>In women who are not breastfeeding, the use of a tight brassiere and avoidance of breast stimulation suppresses lactation in 60 to 70 percent of patients and is the recommended treatment; there are no high-quality studies comparing use of nondrug approaches to no treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-postpartum-period-physiology-complications-and-maternal-care/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Drug therapy is not recommended for suppression of lactation because the risks associated with all of the currently available drugs outweigh any benefit. As an example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bromocriptine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bromocriptine</a>, which was used in the past, has been associated with various complications such as stroke, myocardial infarction, seizures, and psychiatric problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin and hair</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Striae, if present, fade from red to silvery but are permanent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal skin may remain lax if extensive rupture of elastic fibers occurred during pregnancy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chloasma resolves, although the exact timing is not known.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The increase in the ratio of &quot;growing&quot; or anagen hair relative to the &quot;resting&quot; or telogen hair during pregnancy reverses in the puerperium.

Contraction of the uterus and loss of lochial fluid and excess intra- and extracellular fluid leads to an additional loss of 5 to 15 pounds (2 to 7 kg) during the puerperium. Approximately one-half of gestational weight gain is lost in the first six weeks after delivery, with a slower rate of loss through the first six months postpartum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-postpartum-period-physiology-complications-and-maternal-care/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

Within the first 10 minutes following a term vaginal delivery, the cardiac output and stroke volume increase by approximately 60 and 70 percent, respectively. At one hour postpartum, both the cardiac output and stroke volume remain increased (by approximately 50 and 70 percent, respectively) while the heart rate decreases by 15 percent; blood pressure remains unchanged. The increases in stroke volume and cardiac output most likely result from improved cardiac preload from auto transfusion of utero placental blood to the intravascular space. As the uterus decompresses following delivery, a reduction in the mechanical compression of the vena cava allows for further increases in cardiac preload.</p><p>A study that evaluated cardiac output and stroke volume in 15 healthy nonlaboring patients at 38 weeks of gestation and again at 2, 6, 12, and 24 weeks postpartum demonstrated a gradual diminution in cardiac output from 7.42 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span> at 38 weeks of gestation to 4.96 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span> at 24 weeks postpartum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-postpartum-period-physiology-complications-and-maternal-care/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

Postpartum nerve deficits are usually mononeuropathies that result from compression, stretch, transection, or vascular injury.

The rationale for screening include that postpartum depression is common, the combination of screening and adequate support improves clinical outcomes, and treatment (particularly with cognitive behavioral therapy) is associated with symptom remission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-postpartum-period-physiology-complications-and-maternal-care/abstract/113\" class=\"abstract_t\">113</a>]. Direct and indirect evidence support a net benefit from screening and an absence of harm. Depression screening is performed at the routine postpartum visit, but consideration should be given to additional earlier screening and follow-up in patients at high risk for depression. Screening is appropriate whether or not the patient has a prior history of depression or depressive disorder.
