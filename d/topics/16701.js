This approach can minimize the risk of drug-drug interactions, while at the same time prevent both discontinuation and depressive symptoms that may otherwise occur from abrupt drug withdrawal. In a cross-taper, the dose of the current antidepressant is gradually reduced and then stopped, while simultaneously the new antidepressant is started and titrated up to the therapeutic range. Cross-tapering typically occurs over a one to two week period, but for patients who have previously demonstrated sensitivity to side effects or discontinuation symptoms, cross-tapering is extended over three to four weeks. Cross tapering is consistent with multiple treatment guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/switching-antidepressant-medications-in-adults/abstract/2-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6</a>]. </p><p>However, cross-tapering is contraindicated if the two antidepressants can cause moderate to severe drug-drug interactions. In these situations, the current antidepressant is tapered and stopped, and the new drug is then started, either immediately or after a washout period. As an example, when patients are switched to a monoamine oxidase inhibitor (MAOI), the current antidepressant must first be tapered and then discontinued; the next step is a washout period, after which the MAOI is started (see <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Switching to or from MAOIs'</a> below). Specific interactions of antidepressants with each other and with other medications may be determined using the drug interactions tool (Lexi-Interact Online) included in UpToDate. This tool can be accessed from the UpToDate online search page or through the individual drug information topics in the section on Drug interactions. &#160;</p><p>In certain situations, another alternative to cross-tapering is directly (immediately) switching from one antidepressant to another. In a direct switch, the current antidepressant is abruptly stopped and the new drug is started the next day at the equivalent dose (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F53818\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53818 \">table 1</a>). It is reasonable to directly switch between antidepressants that share pharmacodynamic profiles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/switching-antidepressant-medications-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]; this is often most evident when switches occur within the same drug class, such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). &#160; </p><p>Switching antidepressants may also involve abruptly discontinuing the current antidepressant if it causes a severe adverse reaction. We generally wait a few days (eg, two to three) before starting the new antidepressant. </p><p>When switching antidepressants, discontinuation symptoms that occur as a result of stopping the current drug may be mistaken as adverse side effects of the new drug that is started. Discontinuation symptoms are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=discontinuing-antidepressant-medications-in-adults#H209967\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Discontinuing antidepressant medications in adults&quot;, section on 'Discontinuation symptoms'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H207718\"><span class=\"h2\">Specific switches</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Each section below describes specific antidepressant switches and aspects that may vary from the standard approach of cross-tapering.

Nevertheless, starting the new SSRI at a lower dose is a reasonable alternative because patients occasionally have idiosyncratic side effects to particular SSRIs. Switching between SSRIs is generally the simplest antidepressant switch because SSRIs overlap in their mechanism of action, and the new SSRI usually prevents discontinuation symptoms that may otherwise occur when the current SSRI is stopped. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=discontinuing-antidepressant-medications-in-adults#H209967\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Discontinuing antidepressant medications in adults&quot;, section on 'Discontinuation symptoms'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">SSRI to SNRI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Switching directly (immediately) from most SSRIs to the equivalent dose of a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F53818\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53818 \">table 1</a>) is typically well-tolerated because SNRIs have strong serotonergic properties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/switching-antidepressant-medications-in-adults/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. However, if patients switch from a high dose of an SSRI, cross-tapering is preferable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/switching-antidepressant-medications-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Standard approach'</a> above.)</p><p>Patients switching from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoxetine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paroxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paroxetine</a> to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=duloxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">duloxetine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venlafaxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">venlafaxine</a> should start the SNRI at low doses. Fluoxetine and paroxetine strongly inhibit the hepatic enzyme CYP2D6, which metabolizes duloxetine and venlafaxine; inhibition of the enzyme thus increases the SNRI serum concentrations. In addition, inhibition of CYP2D6 may affect the efficacy of venlafaxine. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=serotonin-norepinephrine-reuptake-inhibitors-snris-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects#H276509267\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs): Pharmacology, administration, and side effects&quot;, section on 'Venlafaxine'</a>.)</p><p>Inhibition of CYP2D6 is present to some degree until the SSRI is completely cleared; most SSRIs are cleared in approximately five days, but <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoxetine</a> persists in the system for up to five weeks due to its long half-life. Completely tapering off the SSRI prior to starting an SNRI can prevent problems caused by drug-enzyme interactions, but is usually impractical because doing so risks exacerbating the patient's psychiatric illness. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H735483140\"><span class=\"h3\">SSRI to tricyclic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common method used to switch from an SSRI to a tricyclic antidepressant is a cross-taper (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Standard approach'</a> above). Tricyclics should be started at low doses when cross-tapering them with an SSRI, particularly with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoxetine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluvoxamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluvoxamine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paroxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paroxetine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/switching-antidepressant-medications-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Fluoxetine and paroxetine strongly inhibit the hepatic enzyme CYP2D6 and fluvoxamine potently inhibits CYP1A2. These enzymes are involved in the metabolism of many tricyclics and inhibition increases tricyclic serum concentrations (several-fold higher in some cases), which can result in toxicity. Tricyclic serum levels can be checked during cross-tapering for added safety, but this is not standard practice. &#160;</p><p>Inhibition of CYP2D6 is present to some degree until the SSRI is completely cleared; most SSRIs are cleared in approximately five days, but <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoxetine</a> persists in the system for up to five weeks due to its long half-life.

In a direct switch, the current antidepressant is abruptly stopped and the new drug is started the next day at the equivalent dose (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F53818\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53818 \">table 1</a>). A reasonable alternative is to start the new SSRI at a lower dose. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Between SSRIs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To switch from an SSRI to a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI), we generally switch directly to the equivalent dose of the SNRI (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F53818\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53818 \">table 1</a>). However, if patients switch from a high dose of an SSRI, cross-tapering is preferable. In addition, patients switching from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoxetine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paroxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paroxetine</a> to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=duloxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">duloxetine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venlafaxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">venlafaxine</a> should start the SNRI at low doses. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'SSRI to SNRI'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To switch from SNRIs to antidepressants other than monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), we generally cross-taper over a two to three week period. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'SNRI to other antidepressants'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To switch to or from an atypical antidepressant, we generally cross-taper.

In addition, we wait two weeks between discontinuing an MAOI and starting a different antidepressant.
