Within this category, tumors from many primary sites with varying biology are represented. Improved radiologic and pathologic methods including gene expression profiling, immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, and positron emission tomography (PET) have improved diagnosis and allowed prediction of the site of tumor origin in most patients with CUP. However, the anatomic primary site usually cannot be detected, so that CUP patients remain a clinically distinct group. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-classification-and-management-of-cancers-of-unknown-primary-site\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the classification and management of cancers of unknown primary site&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Adenocarcinomas of unknown primary site comprise approximately 70 percent of CUPs. In autopsy series, although tumors may arise from a wide variety of primary sites, the most frequently identified sites are lung, pancreas, hepatobiliary tree, and kidney, together accounting for approximately two-thirds of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenocarcinoma-of-unknown-primary-site/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Adenocarcinomas of the breast and prostate are identified infrequently at autopsy, despite being the most common cancers in women and men, respectively. In 20 to 30 percent of patients, no primary site can be identified. Large autopsy series include patients who were not evaluated with modern imaging such as computerized tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET), and therefore published data may not accurately reflect the current patient population with adenocarcinoma of unknown primary. </p><p>In patients with adenocarcinomas of unknown primary site, the focus is on identifying specific subsets in which disease-oriented therapy may be more effective than empiric therapy; this is based upon a combination of clinical features, IHC, and gene expression profiling. </p><p>The diagnosis and management of patients with adenocarcinoma of unknown primary are reviewed here. </p><p>The diagnosis and management of the other CUPs are discussed separately.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-classification-and-management-of-cancers-of-unknown-primary-site\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the classification and management of cancers of unknown primary site&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=poorly-differentiated-cancer-from-an-unknown-primary-site\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Poorly differentiated cancer from an unknown primary site&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=head-and-neck-squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-unknown-primary\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuroendocrine-neoplasms-of-unknown-primary-site\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuroendocrine neoplasms of unknown primary site&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-unknown-primary-site\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Squamous cell carcinoma of unknown primary site&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=axillary-node-metastases-with-occult-primary-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Axillary node metastases with occult primary breast cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4121242786\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION AND COURSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of adenocarcinoma of unknown primary site increases with age. The clinical presentation is determined by the sites of metastatic tumor involvement, which are frequently multiple and often include the liver, lungs, lymph nodes, and bones. Many patients with adenocarcinoma of unknown primary have widespread metastases and poor performance status at diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F72901\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72901 \">table 1</a>). The outlook for most of these patients is poor, although this is influenced by the site of metastases and extent of tumor burden. </p><p>In an analysis of almost 19,000 patients with CUPs (70 percent with adenocarcinoma) from the Swedish Cancer Registry from 1987 to 2008, the median survival for those with adenocarcinoma was three months, with a 17 percent one-year survival rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenocarcinoma-of-unknown-primary-site/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Another analysis from this cancer registry found that there was an improvement over time in overall survival (OS) in patients with adenocarcinoma (median OS of approximately six months for periods 2001 to 2008 versus four months for 1987 to 1993) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenocarcinoma-of-unknown-primary-site/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>However, small subsets of patients have a more favorable outlook, and initial evaluation should attempt to identify these patients. Additional diagnostic tests including improved immunohistochemical (IHC) stains and gene expression profiling (molecular cancer classifier assays) have improved the identification of the site of tumor origin, and improved the prognosis of selected patients when treated with site-specific therapy. Empiric chemotherapy also results in modest survival improvement for patients with good performance status. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation of the tumor specimen'</a> below and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Specific patient subgroups'</a> below and <a href=\"#H315626628\" class=\"local\">'Treatment for patients not included in specific subgroups'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2278671403\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL CLINICAL EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial studies for a patient with CUP should focus on determining the extent of metastatic disease, as well as identifying those patients whose tumors were likely to have arisen in a treatable primary site. </p><p>At a minimum, this initial evaluation should include a thorough history and physical examination, complete blood count, urinalysis, basic serum chemistries, and computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis. In men, assessment should incorporate a prostate examination and measurement of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA). In women, the evaluation should include a pelvic examination and mammography. Breast MRI should be performed in the setting of a negative mammogram in women with adenocarcinoma involving the axillary lymph nodes. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Women with axillary lymph node metastases'</a> below.)</p><p>Positron emission tomography (PET) is an additional standard diagnostic staging procedure that may be useful in certain presentations. In a number of retrospective series, PET identified a primary site in approximately 40 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenocarcinoma-of-unknown-primary-site/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. However, in the single existing prospective study, PET was not superior compared with CT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenocarcinoma-of-unknown-primary-site/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Therefore, the use of PET should be restricted to the evaluation of patients with specific clinical presentations (eg, squamous carcinoma in cervical lymph nodes or those with a single metastasis).</p><p>Exhaustive imaging and endoscopic testing should not be performed, since these studies rarely detect the primary site in the asymptomatic patient and confusion can result from false-positive results. Instead, the presence of specific signs or symptoms, or specific findings on biopsy, should guide the choice of additional studies. Colonoscopy should be performed in patients with intraabdominal metastases who have a <span class=\"nowrap\">CK20+/CK7-</span> immunohistochemical (IHC) staining pattern, a positive CDX-2 IHC stain, or a gene expression profile predictive of colorectal cancer. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation of the tumor specimen'</a> below.)</p><p>Commonly measured serum tumor markers (carcinoembryonic antigen [CEA], cancer antigen [CA] 19-9, CA 15-3, CA 125) are generally not useful as diagnostic or prognostic tests. However, they are commonly elevated and may be useful in following the response to therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenocarcinoma-of-unknown-primary-site/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION OF THE TUMOR SPECIMEN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Carcinoma of unknown primary is, by definition, a metastatic tumor for which pretreatment evaluation does not reveal a primary site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenocarcinoma-of-unknown-primary-site/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In cases of suspected CUP, a biopsy of the most accessible site should be performed, preferably using a core needle or excisional biopsy to obtain sufficient tissue for all necessary studies. Adenocarcinoma can usually be distinguished from other histologies by light microscopic examination. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and additional studies should be guided by the tumor histology, as described below. Treatment should then proceed based on results of these assessments (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F86664\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef86664 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2835562428\"><span class=\"h2\">Light microscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of adenocarcinoma is usually based upon the identification of glandular structures that are formed by the neoplastic cells. These features are shared by all adenocarcinomas, and the site of the primary tumor usually cannot be determined by light microscopy. Although certain morphologic features can be associated with a particular tumor type (eg, papillary features with ovarian cancer and signet ring cells with gastric cancer), they generally are not sufficiently specific to provide a definitive diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H75486546\"><span class=\"h3\">Special considerations for poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma is usually made when only minimal glandular formation is seen on histologic examination or in tumors that lack glandular differentiation but stain positively for mucin. Adenocarcinoma, poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma, and poorly differentiated carcinoma are histologic diagnoses that represent a spectrum of tumor differentiation rather than well-demarcated entities. Different pathologists may use somewhat different criteria for each of these diagnoses.</p><p>The light microscopic diagnosis of poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma should be interpreted with caution, since some of these patients have a distinctive tumor biology and responsiveness to systemic chemotherapy. For this reason, evaluation and treatment of patients with poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma of unknown primary should follow the guidelines outlined for poorly differentiated carcinoma of unknown primary, including the use of IHC staining, a molecular cancer classifier assay, and electron microscopy (if necessary) to identify potentially chemotherapy-responsive cancer and rule out other tumor types such as hematologic malignancies, sarcomas, neuroendocrine carcinomas, or germ cell tumors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=poorly-differentiated-cancer-from-an-unknown-primary-site#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Poorly differentiated cancer from an unknown primary site&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunohistochemistry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although IHC may suggest the most likely primary site (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F54258\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54258 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F56518\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56518 \">table 2</a>), in most cases, it is not specific enough for definitive identification of the site of origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenocarcinoma-of-unknown-primary-site/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Involvement of a pathologist experienced in CUP cases is an essential component of the workup [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenocarcinoma-of-unknown-primary-site/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>In a few situations, IHC provides strong evidence regarding the primary site (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F62750\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62750 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F56518\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56518 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenocarcinoma-of-unknown-primary-site/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Positive staining for prostate-specific antigen (PSA) is quite specific for prostate cancer and should be included in the evaluation of men with adenocarcinoma of unknown primary site. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Positive staining for thyroglobulin in concert with thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) is relatively specific for thyroid cancer. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pattern of results with CK20 and CK7 may be particularly helpful in suggesting a primary site (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F62750\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62750 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F58475\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58475 \">table 4</a>). CK20 is a low molecular weight cytokeratin that is normally expressed in the gastrointestinal epithelium, urothelium, and in Merkel cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenocarcinoma-of-unknown-primary-site/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. CK7 is expressed by tumors of the lung, ovary, endometrium, and breast, but not in tumors of the lower gastrointestinal tract.</p><p/><p>Thus, the phenotype <span class=\"nowrap\">CK20+/CK7-</span> supports the diagnosis of a colorectal carcinoma. The utility of this staining pattern was illustrated in a study of 93 autopsy cases of adenocarcinoma of known primary site involving the liver, in which a <span class=\"nowrap\">CK20+/CK7-</span> pattern correctly predicted a colorectal primary in 17 of 21 cases (81 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenocarcinoma-of-unknown-primary-site/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In the same study, a <span class=\"nowrap\">CK20+/CK7+</span> pattern predicted a cancer of pancreatic or biliary origin in 11 of 14 cases (79 percent). The <span class=\"nowrap\">CK20-/CK7+</span> group was too heterogeneous to be classified adequately by these two antibodies. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Gene expression profiling (molecular cancer classifier assays)'</a> below.) </p><p>However, in other circumstances, IHC results are less likely to conclusively identify the primary site. As an example, IHC staining for the estrogen (ER) or progesterone receptor (PR) suggests metastatic breast cancer in women with adenocarcinoma of unknown primary. However, other primary sites (ovary, endometrium, nonreproductive organs) may also express these markers. Another example is TTF-1, which is a marker for both lung adenocarcinomas and small cell carcinomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenocarcinoma-of-unknown-primary-site/abstract/10,15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,15-17</a>].</p><p>In other patients with adenocarcinoma of unknown primary, batteries of IHC stains have been used to suggest the most likely primary site (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F54258\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54258 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F56518\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56518 \">table 2</a>). These panels have included CK20 and CK7, gross cystic disease fluid protein 15, breast cancer antigen (BCA) 225, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), vimentin, and cancer antigen (CA) 19-9 and 125 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenocarcinoma-of-unknown-primary-site/abstract/14,18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,18-20</a>]. Although suggestive, these stains are not specific enough to dictate treatment in most patients. Even when batteries of IHC stains are used, the results strongly suggest a single cancer type in only 33 percent of CUP patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenocarcinoma-of-unknown-primary-site/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>None of these IHC results have been prospectively evaluated for accuracy in identifying the primary site in patients with carcinoma of unknown primary site. Likewise, no studies have addressed the question of whether treatment based upon these IHC &quot;diagnoses&quot; improves the outcome for these patients. Thus, the results of IHC staining should be interpreted in conjunction with the clinical presentation and histologic findings.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Gene expression profiling (molecular cancer classifier assays)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The role of gene expression profiling in the diagnostic evaluation of patients with CUP remains controversial, but is gaining more widespread acceptance. The authors feel there are adequate aggregate data to support: 1) the diagnostic accuracy of molecular cancer classifier assays [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenocarcinoma-of-unknown-primary-site/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>], and 2) their therapeutic value in guiding site-specific therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenocarcinoma-of-unknown-primary-site/abstract/24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-27</a>]. While awaiting results from larger, more definitive studies, the authors suggest the use of gene expression profiling in the management of patients for whom other clinical and pathologic assessments have not identified a primary site of disease. This is in contrast to guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), which does not consider gene signature profiling for tissue of origin to be a part of standard management at this time, suggesting its use judiciously on a case-by-case basis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenocarcinoma-of-unknown-primary-site/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The diagnostic accuracy of the molecular cancer classifier assays is accepted; however, their effect on patient outcomes is not yet considered definitive. </p><p>The rationale for gene expression profiling is that specific profiles are observed in cancers from different sites of origin, reflecting the different profiles of the normal tissues of origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenocarcinoma-of-unknown-primary-site/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The molecular cancer classifier assay enables prediction of a tissue of tumor origin based on detection of site-specific gene expression profiles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenocarcinoma-of-unknown-primary-site/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Gene expression profiling should not be confused with comprehensive molecular profiling or sequencing, which is performed for the purpose of detecting actionable molecular alterations in the cancer. </p><p>Several molecular cancer classifier assays, using either reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) or gene microarray technology, are commercially available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenocarcinoma-of-unknown-primary-site/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>] and provide results with a turnaround time of one to two weeks. Although these assays have not been directly compared, they all accurately identified the tissue of origin in approximately 85 percent of patients with advanced CUPs. In retrospective studies, several molecular cancer classifier assays predicted a probable primary tumor site in most CUP patients, and most predictions were consistent with the clinical and pathologic features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenocarcinoma-of-unknown-primary-site/abstract/21,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,32,33</a>]. However, confirmation of the accuracy of gene expression profiling in patients with CUP is difficult, since the anatomic primary site rarely becomes manifest in these patients.</p><p>As an example, in a series of 24 patients in whom subsequent clinical follow-up identified the latent primary site, gene expression profiling of the initial metastatic site biopsy correctly identified the primary site in 18 (75 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenocarcinoma-of-unknown-primary-site/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. More often, the primary site is never identified clinically. In a group of 171 such patients identified retrospectively, the original biopsy material was adequate for analysis in 149 (87 percent), and gene expression profiling suggested a single diagnosis in 144 cases (97 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenocarcinoma-of-unknown-primary-site/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. By contrast, IHC suggested a single site in 33 percent of cases, and was consistent with two or more sites in the remainder. The predictions of gene expression profiling and IHC correlated closely when IHC was able to predict a single site of origin (77 percent of cases), but were consistent in less than 50 percent when IHC suggested two or more sites. </p><p>The impact of gene expression profiling predictions on therapeutic results in patients with CUP is not fully established. However, developing data are promising and discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H315626636\" class=\"local\">'Site-specific therapy directed by gene expression profiling'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECIFIC PATIENT SUBGROUPS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The group of patients with adenocarcinoma of unknown primary site contains several clinically defined subgroups for which specific therapy is available. All patients who fit into one of these subgroups after the clinical and pathologic evaluations have been completed should receive specific therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Women with peritoneal carcinomatosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In women, adenocarcinoma causing diffuse peritoneal involvement without an obvious primary tumor usually originates in the ovary or in extraovarian tissues with similar histogenesis. Disease-directed therapy can result in a relatively favorable outlook in these patients compared with adenocarcinoma of unknown primary site of nonovarian origin.

Many have morphologic features that are typical for epithelial ovarian carcinoma, such as papillary configuration or psammoma bodies. In such cases, this syndrome has been termed serous carcinoma of the peritoneum (SCP) or multifocal extraovarian serous carcinoma. However, some patients may present with a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma that does not exhibit a papillary configuration (analogous to poorly differentiated epithelial ovarian carcinomas); they should be approached similarly to those with typical serous histology.

In both series, approximately 45 percent of patients predicted to have colorectal cancer by molecular cancer classifier assay had atypical IHC staining, and would not have been identified by standard pathologic evaluation. Although prospective data are needed, the survival documented in these retrospective studies, which is similar to patients with advanced colon cancer, suggests accurate identification by molecular profiling.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Adenocarcinoma of unknown primary in a single site</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In occasional patients, only a single metastatic lesion is identified after a complete staging evaluation.

The possibility of an unusual primary site (eg, apocrine, eccrine, or sebaceous carcinoma) mimicking a metastatic lesion should be considered, but can usually be excluded on the basis of clinical or pathologic features.</p><p>In most of these patients, other metastatic sites become evident within a relatively short time. A positron emission tomography (PET) scan may be helpful to rule out additional unrecognized sites of metastatic disease prior to definitive local therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenocarcinoma-of-unknown-primary-site/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].

Local treatment sometimes results in long disease-free intervals.</p><p>The benefit of surgical resection of more than one metastatic lesion in patients with CUP is not well-documented. Since this approach is recommended in highly selected patients with several tumor types (eg, renal carcinoma, colon cancer with liver metastases, non-small cell lung cancer [NSCLC]), it may also be reasonable in occasional patients with CUP.</p><p>In some instances (eg, after resection of a solitary brain metastasis), local radiation therapy may also be appropriate to maximize the chance of local control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenocarcinoma-of-unknown-primary-site/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>].

However, a primary site can now be predicted in many of these patients using IHC and gene expression profiling. Adjuvant therapy is reasonable to consider if indicated in the management of the tumor type predicted.

In addition, accurate prediction of the tissue of origin could lead to appropriate testing for actionable gene mutations. For example, a prediction of non-small cell lung cancer could lead to the identification of an <em>EGFR</em> or <em>ALK</em> mutation, with specific therapeutic implications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenocarcinoma-of-unknown-primary-site/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

Although a randomized trial is the only way to provide a definitive answer to this question, the available data strongly suggest that site-directed therapy directed by gene expression profiling improves outcome for patients with CUP. Gene expression profiling should be included as part of the diagnostic workup of patients with CUP in whom other methods have not identified a specific cancer type, and we suggest subsequent site-specific therapy, particularly in patients predicted to have responsive tumor types. </p><p>In the largest prospective study to date, newly diagnosed, previously untreated patients with CUP had tumor biopsy material submitted for a 92-gene reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) molecular cancer classifier assay and then received site-specific treatment based upon the assay prediction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenocarcinoma-of-unknown-primary-site/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Of the 252 patients whose biopsies contained sufficient tumor, 247 (98 percent) had a tissue of origin predicted. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The median survival of the 194 patients who received site-specific therapy was 12.5 months, which compares favorably to the historical results in which patients were treated with empiric drug regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenocarcinoma-of-unknown-primary-site/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Patients who had predictions of more responsive tumor types had longer median survival than those with less responsive types (13.4 versus 7.6 months). The median survival of patient groups with different specific tumor predictions varied widely, and generally mirrored the expected survival of patients with the predicted cancer types (biliary tract 7 months, pancreas 8 months, colon 13 months, ovarian 30 months, and breast cancer not reached at &gt;24 months).</p><p/><p>Other studies also support the use of site-specific treatment based on gene expression profiling results. In one study, a molecular cancer classifier assay was assessed in a group of 216 CUP patients, which resulted in the prediction of a specific primary site in 87 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenocarcinoma-of-unknown-primary-site/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Treatment received by 114 of these patients was examined retrospectively. Thirty-one patients who received treatment known to be effective for their assay diagnosis had a median survival of 13.6 months, as compared with a six-month median survival for the 61 patients who received empiric chemotherapy predicted ineffective for their assay diagnosis. In a separate prospective trial, 45 CUP patients were treated with an empiric regimen of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carboplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carboplatin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paclitaxel</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=everolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">everolimus</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adenocarcinoma-of-unknown-primary-site/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

An increasing number of targeted therapies are known to be active against specific molecular targets. In addition, new immunomodulatory drugs have proven effective against several tumor types that can present as CUP (eg, non-small cell lung cancer [NSCLC], urothelial carcinoma). Clinical trials addressing the efficacy of these new modalities in CUP are needed. While awaiting results from clinical trials, additional testing for specific actionable mutations, based on the site of origin predicted by immunohistochemistry (IHC) or gene expression profiling, should be considered. For example, for a patient with CUP predicted to be of lung origin by these studies, the presence of an activating epidermal growth factor receptor (<em>EGFR</em>) mutation would be an appropriate indication to initiate treatment with an EGFR inhibitor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cancer of unknown primary site (CUP) is defined as a metastatic tumor whose primary site cannot be identified during pretreatment evaluation and accounts for 4 to 5 percent of all invasive cancers.

Additional evaluation may be warranted based on the findings of clinical and pathologic assessment.

While guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) for the evaluation of an occult primary do not consider gene expression profiling for tissue of origin to be a part of standard management at this time, the authors feel there are adequate aggregate data to support its use for diagnosis and site-directed treatment for patients in whom other clinical and pathologic studies have not identified a primary site.
