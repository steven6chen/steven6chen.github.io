The prevalence of this disorder is 1 to 2 percent of the general population in the United States and is believed to be similar around the world [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-standard-management-and-patient-education/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Associated angioedema occurs in at least 50 percent of patients with CU and usually affects the lips, cheeks, periorbital areas of the face, extremities, and genitals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-standard-management-and-patient-education/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>This topic will discuss the initial and most commonly used therapies for CU, as well as counseling of individuals with this disorder. Treatment of CU that is refractory to standard management and the diagnosis, pathogenesis, and prognosis of CU are presented separately.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-angioedema-pathogenesis-and-causes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of angioedema: Pathogenesis and causes&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urticarial-vasculitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urticarial vasculitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-urticarias\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical urticarias&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cold-urticaria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cold urticaria&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In this review, the term chronic urticaria (CU) refers to patients with isolated chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU), as well as those with both urticaria and angioedema. There are several closely related terms that are used in the CU literature.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12466492\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic idiopathic urticaria and chronic spontaneous urticaria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The terms &quot;chronic urticaria,&quot; &quot;chronic idiopathic urticaria,&quot; and &quot;chronic spontaneous urticaria&quot; are used interchangeably in this review. Chronic urticaria is the most general term and is used less in the literature over time because it is nonspecific and would often be used to describe patients with a mixture of idiopathic urticaria and physical urticaria (ie, hives triggered by physical stimuli, such as heat, cold, pressure applied to the skin, exercise, water, vibration, and sunlight). Physical urticaria, also called &quot;inducible urticaria,&quot; is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-urticarias\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical urticarias&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The term &quot;chronic spontaneous urticaria&quot; is increasingly used instead of CIU or CU. This term refers to CU in which appearance of lesions is not triggered by consistent or identifiable factors, and it specifically excludes the physical urticaria syndromes or other inducible forms of urticaria. We prefer this term over the others, although it is not as familiar to nonspecialists, so we continue to use the generic term CU.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic autoimmune urticaria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some studies distinguish between patients with and without positive autologous serum skin tests (ASSTs) or other laboratory indicators of an autoimmune process. The terms &quot;chronic autoimmune urticaria&quot; or &quot;autoantibody associated urticaria&quot; are variably used. In this review, this distinction is mentioned only if a study found a difference between these two patient groups. The performance and interpretation of an ASST is reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-urticaria-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-pathogenesis-and-natural-history#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic urticaria: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, pathogenesis, and natural history&quot;, section on 'Autoimmune theory'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1913277857\"><span class=\"h1\">GUIDELINES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment guidelines and practice parameters for the management of chronic urticaria (CU) have been published by professional allergy and dermatology groups worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-standard-management-and-patient-education/abstract/1,6-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6-13</a>]. In all cases, management begins with a careful clinical history to detect and minimize aggravating factors, followed by initial treatment with H1 antihistamines. If symptoms persist, most guidelines suggest increasing the dose of H1 antihistamine, changing agents, or both. When symptoms are refractory to these measures, guidelines differ somewhat as to the next steps, although most suggest the addition of an H2 antihistamine or antileukotriene agents (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F110675\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110675 \">figure 1</a>). The approach described here is consistent with the 2014 American practice parameter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-standard-management-and-patient-education/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT EDUCATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic urticaria (CU) causes marked distress to patients because it is physically uncomfortable, waxes and wanes unpredictably, interferes with work, school, and sleep, and is often difficult to treat. The severity and duration of symptoms vary among individuals, and the underlying cause is not known in most cases. Furthermore, it can be misinterpreted by others to be infectious, and patients may stay home to avoid embarrassment. All of these factors contribute to patient frustration and anxiety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-standard-management-and-patient-education/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Reassurance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with CU are often frustrated and fearful, and reassurance is an important component of successful management. There are several important concepts to relay to patients with CU:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CU is rarely a sign of another underlying disease. When it is, the hives are usually accompanied by other systemic symptoms that are noticeable to the patient <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the clinician.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CU is rarely permanent. Almost 50 percent of patients experience remission within one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-standard-management-and-patient-education/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, for those in whom the disorder persists beyond one year, approximately 14 percent will still have symptoms beyond five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-standard-management-and-patient-education/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CU is not an allergic reaction and it rarely puts the patient at any acute risk. This can be confusing to patients because acute urticaria and angioedema are manifestations of allergic reactions, which can be life-threatening. However, CU is limited to the skin and mucosal tissues and does not involve other organ system as an allergic reaction can. Also, the angioedema that sometimes accompanies CU tends to be milder and rarely compromises the airway.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The symptoms of CU can be successfully managed in the majority of patients.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Avoidance of exacerbating factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CU, by definition, has no external cause or triggering stimulus that explains all episodes. However, there are various factors that can exacerbate CU. The evaluation and diagnosis of persistent urticaria are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-urticaria-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-pathogenesis-and-natural-history\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic urticaria: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, pathogenesis, and natural history&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Once the diagnosis of <span class=\"nowrap\">CU/angioedema</span> has been established, the clinician should begin educating the patient about management, including avoidance of factors that can aggravate the condition (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F98751\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef98751 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Physical factors</strong> &ndash; A substantial subset of patients with CU have some flares that are triggered by physical stimuli. Educating patients about this can help them avoid these stimuli or simply make sense of their symptoms. As an example, heat (hot showers, extreme humidity) is a common trigger for many CU patients, and tight clothing or straps can also aggravate symptoms. In contrast, patients in whom physical factors are the <strong>main</strong> trigger for symptoms are more appropriately diagnosed as having a physical urticarial syndrome, such as cholinergic urticaria or delayed-pressure urticaria. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-urticarias\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical urticarias&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cold-urticaria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cold urticaria&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Anti-inflammatory medications</strong> &ndash; Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) worsen symptoms in many patients. After the ingestion of NSAIDs, patients may develop worsening of urticaria as quickly as 15 minutes or as delayed as 24 hours, although most patients report symptoms within 1 to 4 hours. In a study of 68 children with CU and no history of previous reactions to NSAIDs, challenge-proven <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> sensitivity was found in 10 to 24 percent, most often manifesting as lip angioedema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-standard-management-and-patient-education/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In adults with CU, 20 to 40 percent will experience worsening symptoms after ingesting NSAIDs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-standard-management-and-patient-education/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Once the NSAID is stopped, most patients return to the baseline state in a few hours to two days, although some may continue to have increased symptoms for up to two weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-standard-management-and-patient-education/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Dietary manipulations (controversial)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For most patients with CU, dietary manipulations are not indicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-standard-management-and-patient-education/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. It is particularly important to explain to patients that an undiscovered allergy to food or food additives is <strong>not</strong> likely to be responsible for their symptoms. Immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated food reactions are not a cause of CU, and testing for food allergy is not necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-standard-management-and-patient-education/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-urticaria-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-pathogenesis-and-natural-history#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic urticaria: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, pathogenesis, and natural history&quot;, section on 'Foods and food additives'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergic-and-asthmatic-reactions-to-food-additives#H10181207\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Allergic and asthmatic reactions to food additives&quot;, section on 'Patients with chronic urticaria'</a>.)</p><p>Although CU is not a manifestation of IgE-mediated food allergy, food can cause fluctuations in the symptoms of CU that are noticeable to patients. This is believed to be due to the presence of &quot;pseudoallergens,&quot; which are substances in food that exacerbate CU. Pseudoallergens include naturally occurring aromatic compounds in certain foods (many fruits and vegetables, seafood, others), as well as artificial preservatives and dyes in processed foods. Diets free of pseudoallergens are difficult to follow because the array of foods that must be avoided is so broad (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F68566\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68566 \">table 2</a>). The limited clinical relevance of pseudoallergens in CU is also supported by the observation that patients in whom CU has remitted are able to eat anything without recurrence of urticaria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-standard-management-and-patient-education/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>We do <strong>not</strong> routinely advise CU patients to adopt pseudoallergen-free diets because adherence is so difficult, and dietary modifications are not supported by most practice parameters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-standard-management-and-patient-education/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, if a patient is very motivated to try these diets, we do not object. The utility of pseudoallergen-free diets and low-histamine diets in CU has been evaluated in a few uncontrolled studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-standard-management-and-patient-education/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One prospective study concluded that adherence to a diet low in pseudoallergens was helpful, since 73 percent of 64 CU patients had either cessation or a significant reduction of symptoms within two weeks of adopting a pseudoallergen-free diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-standard-management-and-patient-education/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. However, only 19 percent of those who improved developed symptoms when subsequently challenged with individual pseudoallergens on provocation tests, suggesting that no single substance was responsible and that benefit was dependent upon the strict avoidance of multiple foods.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast to the high rates of response in this study, a subsequent larger study of 140 patients placed on a pseudoallergen-free diet found that only 28 percent had a strong or partial response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-standard-management-and-patient-education/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The foods and other substances that are prohibited in a pseudoallergen-free diet are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F68566\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68566 \">table 2</a>). Several weeks of adherence to this diet may be necessary for clinical improvement.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3658100086\"><span class=\"h1\">STEPWISE APPROACH TO TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A stepwise approach is advocated by the 2014 American guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-standard-management-and-patient-education/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This is similar, although not identical, to guidelines from groups in the United Kingdom and Europe (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F110675\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110675 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-standard-management-and-patient-education/abstract/1,7,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7,13</a>].

In addition, patients differ in their responsiveness to glucocorticoids in both the dose and duration of treatment required to control symptoms. The following are example regimens:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We typically begin with a dose of 40 mg daily (in the morning, with food) for two to three days. Once symptoms are controlled, the dose should be tapered down to 10 mg daily or less, which can typically be done in increments of 10 mg.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other experts suggest 35 to 40 mg initially, given once daily (with food) for five to seven days, followed by tapering by 5 mg every two to three days. Occasionally, patients require higher initial doses or longer courses (eg, three weeks).</p><p/><p>Rebound worsening of urticaria may occur with tapering or discontinuation of systemic glucocorticoids. If this occurs, we return to the last effective dose and then try to taper again more gradually. Some authors suggest that once the dose has been reduced to 20 mg daily, the frequency of administration may be changed to every other day, and then the dose tapered further.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1481423613\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSESSING CONTROL OF SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Control of symptoms should be assessed at each visit.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H500548145\"><span class=\"h2\">Validated questionnaires</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Questionnaires have been developed and validated for monitoring patients with urticaria.

A score of &lt;12 on the UCT identifies patients with poorly controlled chronic urticaria (CU), and a score of &ge;12 identifies those with well-controlled symptoms. An improvement in 3 points is a minimal response, and an improvement of &ge;6 points is a marked response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-standard-management-and-patient-education/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3662866889\"><span class=\"h2\">Maintenance therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many patients with CU require multiple medications to control symptoms fully. Once symptoms have come under control, the patient should be maintained on those agent(s) for a period of time before withdrawal of medications is considered.</p><p>For the majority of patients, we generally recommend three months of good control prior to tapering therapies. The optimal duration of maintenance therapy in a variable disease like CU has not been studied, and we would alter this suggestion for specific situations. For example, patients whose symptoms were easily and completely controlled with one or two agents may begin to taper therapy after one month or two of well-controlled symptoms. We extend the period of control further than three months for patients with one or more of the following characteristics:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms that were present for years, were very severe, or were difficult to control</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Concomitant physical urticarias, which tend to be longer lasting than simple CU</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms that are mostly controlled, but still present at a low level</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2096978744\"><span class=\"h2\">Discontinuing therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At any point in therapy, we discontinue agents that have been deemed ineffective, including antihistamines in patients who are completely antihistamine-resistant. In patients responsive to antihistamine therapy, we gradually reduce antihistamine doses every two to four weeks, beginning with first-generation agents. Other agents can be tapered in a similar fashion.

There were seven subjects who did not respond to 20 mg of desloratadine, but did respond to 20 mg of levocetirizine.

Both groups had improved urticarial scores on cetirizine 20 mg daily, but only the group that remained on the higher dose had continued improvement, with worsening symptoms in the group whose cetirizine dose was reduced. Thus, this study suggests that the higher dose is more effective. However, in another small observational study, increasing cetirizine from 10 mg once daily to 10 mg three times daily improved disease control in only 1 of 22 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-standard-management-and-patient-education/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fexofenadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Fexofenadine</a> has not been shown to be more effective at doses higher than 60 mg twice daily.

The first-generation antihistamines are similarly effective compared with newer second-generation antihistamines, but with more adverse effects.</p><p>In children younger than two years of age, first-generation, sedating antihistamines should be avoided, as these drugs can cause paradoxical agitation, and over-the-counter cold remedies containing them have been linked to a small number of deaths in this age group.

First-generation antihistamines, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyzine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyzine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxepin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxepin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenhydramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diphenhydramine</a>, can enhance the QTc-prolonging effect when combined with other QTc-prolonging agents (eg, anti-arrhythmic drugs, macrolides, fluoroquinolones) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57431\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57431 \">table 4</a>). Therefore, combinations of such drugs should be avoided (when possible), particularly in patients at elevated risk (eg, those with congenital long QT syndrome, electrolyte abnormalities, recent myocardial infarction, or uncompensated heart failure). High doses of doxepin are potentially cardiotoxic and should be avoided in susceptible individuals with heart disease. It is the author's approach to use extra caution in older adults chronically taking first-generation antihistamines at doses greater than 50 mg daily and to obtain a baseline electrocardiogram in such individuals. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-long-qt-syndrome-definitions-causes-and-pathophysiology#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired long QT syndrome: Definitions, causes, and pathophysiology&quot;, section on 'Medications'</a>.)</p><p>Studies of first-generation antihistamines in adults, at usual doses, have shown tolerance to performance impairment after three to five days of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-standard-management-and-patient-education/abstract/59-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">59-61</a>]. Studies in patients with CU given higher doses are lacking, although many patients with CU seem to tolerate high doses without difficulty. Based upon this information, some authors suggest a gradual titration of first-generation antihistamines. As an example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyzine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyzine</a> can be started at 10 to 25 mg daily and increased in 10 to 25 mg increments every five to seven days to a maximum of 25 to 50 mg four times daily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-standard-management-and-patient-education/abstract/24,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,62</a>].</p><p>Another approach is to administer first-generation antihistamines as a single dose in the evening, in combination with a second-generation antihistamine given in the morning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-standard-management-and-patient-education/abstract/2,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,62</a>]. However, in a randomized, double-blind crossover study of 24 patients with CU, this approach (ie, 15 mg <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levocetirizine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levocetirizine</a> in the day, with 50 mg <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyzine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyzine</a> at night) was compared with second-generation agents alone (10 mg levocetirizine twice daily) for periods of five days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-standard-management-and-patient-education/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Wheals and pruritus were reduced by both treatments, and sleep quality was similar. However, daytime somnolence was statistically reduced in patients in the levocetirizine monotherapy group, but remained unchanged from baseline in the hydroxyzine group. The clinical relevance of this change is unknown, and the assessment of daytime somnolence was not validated. In addition, given the long half-life of hydroxyzine, five days is likely an insufficient time to study its efficacy or tolerance. Furthermore, the initial starting dose of 50 mg of hydroxyzine is higher than is typically recommended. The American practice parameters recommend dose advancement of evening doses of first-generation antihistamines in those that have failed higher doses of second-generation antihistamines <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> H2 antihistamines and leukotriene-receptor antagonists.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">H2 antihistamines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients whose symptoms are not adequately controlled on H1 antihistamines alone may experience modest improvement with the addition of an H2-antagonist antihistamine. A meta-analysis concluded that there was insufficient evidence upon which to make recommendations about the use of H2 antihistamines in CU because the available studies were old and at risk for bias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-standard-management-and-patient-education/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. International guidelines do not include H2 antihistamines as an option [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-standard-management-and-patient-education/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

These two drugs are metabolized by the same liver enzymes, and the benefit may be due to increased serum concentrations of one or both drugs, rather than a true synergistic effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-standard-management-and-patient-education/abstract/69,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">69,70</a>]. The same effect was not observed with cimetidine and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cetirizine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cetirizine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-standard-management-and-patient-education/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>], whereas the combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ranitidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ranitidine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=famotidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">famotidine</a>, which do not affect liver enzymes, was shown to be helpful in other studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-standard-management-and-patient-education/abstract/72,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,73</a>]. Thus, until more conclusive data are available, a trial of H2 antihistamines can be considered as additive therapy in patients whose symptoms do not respond adequately to H1 antihistamines alone. If not effective, the H2 antagonist should be discontinued.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Systemic glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systemic (usually oral) glucocorticoids are effective in controlling symptoms in most patients with CU. However, administration beyond several weeks is not justified for a disorder that, in itself, has an excellent long-term prognosis, since glucocorticoids have predictable and significant adverse effects. In addition, a retrospective study found that the addition of glucocorticoids to antihistamines during the initial weeks of treatment did not hasten the time required to achieve control of symptoms, compared with treatment with antihistamines alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-urticaria-standard-management-and-patient-education/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. Thus, there is no evidence that glucocorticoids have a disease-modifying effect. We view glucocorticoids as rescue therapy that should be used to attain temporary control of severe symptoms.
