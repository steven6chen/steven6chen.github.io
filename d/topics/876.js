In term infants, the hemoglobin level typically reaches an average nadir of 11 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> at approximately 8 to 12 weeks after birth.</p><p>In preterm infants who are already born with a lower hematocrit, this decline, referred to as anemia of prematurity (AOP), occurs earlier and is more pronounced in its severity than the anemia seen in term infants. The AOP will be reviewed here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary cause of anemia of prematurity (AOP) is the impaired ability to increase serum erythropoietin (EPO) appropriately in the setting of anemia and decreased tissue availability of oxygen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-of-prematurity/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Circulating and bone marrow red cell progenitors respond to EPO, if present, indicating that the impaired erythropoiesis is due to lack of EPO, not a failure to respond to the hormone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-of-prematurity/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. Other hematopoietic growth factors (eg, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor) are not affected.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Impaired erythropoietin production</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>EPO is produced by the fetal liver and the cortical interstitial cells of the kidney in response to hypoxia. Its production is regulated by the transcription factor hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-1). Its primary function is to regulate erythrocyte production. EPO does not cross the placenta in humans, and fetal production increases with gestational age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-of-prematurity/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>].</p><p>Production of EPO in adults depends on the oxygen saturation of hemoglobin and tissue oxygen delivery, and is inversely proportional to central venous oxygenation. Although EPO levels in preterm infants with AOP increase slightly with hypoxia, they are lower than those seen in older children and adults with the same level of anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-of-prematurity/abstract/2,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=regulation-of-erythropoiesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Regulation of erythropoiesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In AOP, the specific mechanisms leading to the discrepancy between serum EPO concentration and the severity of the anemia are uncertain. Proposed pathogenetic pathways involve the site of EPO production and the developmental regulation of transcription factors in the liver versus the kidney.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The liver is the principal site of EPO production in the fetus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-of-prematurity/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. The feedback increase in hepatic EPO mRNA in response to anemia or hypoxia may be less than that of the kidney [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-of-prematurity/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. EPO mRNA expression in the kidney is present in the fetus, and increases significantly after 30 weeks gestation, suggesting that the switch to the kidney as the main site of EPO production is developmentally regulated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The fetal or neonatal environment may alter the response to hypoxic signals by the liver. Support for this hypothesis comes from the observation that hepatic transplantation from fetal and neonatal lambs into adult sheep increased EPO production by the transplanted liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-of-prematurity/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transcriptional regulatory factors, such as HIF-1, may contribute to low levels of EPO in preterm infants. These factors activate target genes, including those encoding EPO, in response to decreased cellular oxygen concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-of-prematurity/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. They appear to be developmentally regulated in some fetal tissues, which might account for the decreased expression of EPO in response to anemia in preterm infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-of-prematurity/abstract/1,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Other factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although AOP is directly due to impaired EPO production, several other factors can contribute to anemia in preterm infants, including blood loss from phlebotomy, reduced red blood cell life span, and iron depletion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Blood loss from phlebotomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preterm infants frequently develop an early anemia that is primarily due to iatrogenic blood loss due to phlebotomy for blood tests. The volume of blood loss increases with illness severity and decreasing gestational age. In one report, withdrawal of blood in excess of that required for laboratory studies contributed to iatrogenic blood loss by 2 to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per week [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-of-prematurity/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. However, efforts to reduce blood loss from phlebotomy have resulted in changes in clinical practice to limit blood sampling for essential testing and the use of microtechniques, which have reduced iatrogenic blood loss.</p><p>The impact of clinical practice on phlebotomy and blood testing was illustrated in a study of very low birth weight (VLBW) infants (BW &lt;1500 g) cared for in two neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-of-prematurity/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Phlebotomy losses increased with decreasing gestational age and increasing illness severity, as measured by the Score for Neonatal Acute Physiology (SNAP). The average losses due to phlebotomy differed between the two NICUs and resulted in increased average blood transfusion requirements in the NICU with the greater volume of blood loss. However, this difference was not associated with differences in the days of oxygen therapy or mechanical ventilation, risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, or growth rate by day 28 of life. These findings suggest that the additional use of blood in one of the NICUs was discretionary rather than necessary, as clinical outcomes did not differ.</p><p>These studies indicate that blood loss due to phlebotomy in preterm infants may be greater than is necessary for the care of the neonate. They emphasize the need for nursery policies to ensure that only the minimal volume required for testing is drawn, and unnecessary tests are avoided.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Reduced red blood cell life span</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Red blood cell survival in newborn term infants is approximately 60 to 80 days, but decreases with decreasing gestational age to a range of 45 to 50 days in extremely low birth weight infants (ELBW) (BW below 1000 g) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-of-prematurity/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The reduced red cell life span contributes to the severity of anemia. Increased susceptibility to oxidant injury may contribute to shortened red cell survival in the neonate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-of-prematurity/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-survival-normal-values-and-measurement\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell survival: Normal values and measurement&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Iron depletion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although it is not involved in its pathogenesis, iron depletion may impair recovery from AOP. Because of their rapid growth rate, preterm infants have increased utilization and depletion of iron stores and, as noted above, blood loss from phlebotomy. The administration of iron does not inhibit the fall in hemoglobin concentration due to AOP. However, in term infants, it reduces the incidence of iron deficiency anemia in the first year of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-of-prematurity/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iron-deficiency-in-infants-and-children-less-than12-years-screening-prevention-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Iron deficiency in infants and children &lt;12 years: Screening, prevention, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Low levels of other nutrients, such as vitamin B12 or folate, do not appear to contribute to neonatal anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-of-prematurity/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In one randomized trial, the combination of folate, vitamin B12, iron, and EPO compared with control therapy improved the ELBW infant's chance of remaining transfusion free (38 versus 5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-of-prematurity/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">OXYGEN DELIVERY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oxygen delivery is the rate at which oxygen is transported from the lungs to the microcirculation. It is determined by the product of cardiac output and arterial oxygen content. The arterial oxygen content is the amount of oxygen bound to hemoglobin plus the amount of oxygen dissolved in arterial blood. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxygen-delivery-and-consumption\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oxygen delivery and consumption&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Oxygen delivery is dependent upon:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac output</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemoglobin concentration</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oxygen carrying capacity (affinity) of hemoglobin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arterial oxygen saturation and oxygen tension</p><p/><p>In preterm infants with anemia, physiologic changes, which aim at maintaining adequate oxygen delivery, compensate for a significant decrease in hemoglobin, and are similar to those seen in older children and adults. These include increases in heart rate and stroke volume, which improve cardiac output [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-of-prematurity/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>However, anemic preterm infants may be less able to maintain oxygen delivery because of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Concomitant respiratory disease, such as respiratory distress syndrome and bronchopulmonary dysplasia, resulting in hypoxia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limitations on maximum arterial oxygen saturation and oxygen tension for infants requiring respiratory support, because hyperoxia increases the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia and retinopathy of prematurity.

The concentration of HbF in an infant born at 28 weeks gestation is approximately 90 percent, and decreases to approximately 60 percent at 10 weeks after birth, a value that is similar to that of an infant newly born at 38 weeks gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-of-prematurity/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL AND LABORATORY FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anemia of prematurity (AOP) typically occurs at 3 to 12 weeks after birth in infants less than 32 weeks gestation. The onset of AOP is inversely proportional to the gestational age at birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-of-prematurity/abstract/1,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,29,30</a>]. The anemia typically resolves by three to six months of age.</p><p>In a study of 40 very low birth weight (VLBW) infants, average hemoglobin concentrations fell from 18.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> at birth to a mean nadir of 9.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> at six weeks of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-of-prematurity/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Values of 7 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> were common even in the absence of significant phlebotomy losses. Hematocrit values were lowest in the smallest infant with average nadirs of 21 percent in infants with birth weights (BW) less than 1000 g, and 24 percent in infants with BW between 1000 and 1500 g.</p><p>Many infants are asymptomatic despite having hemoglobin values less than 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-of-prematurity/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. However, other infants with AOP are symptomatic at similar or even higher hemoglobin levels because of a reduced capacity to maintain adequate oxygen by other means in compensation for AOP. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Oxygen delivery'</a> above.)</p><p>Symptoms associated with AOP include tachycardia, poor weight gain, increased requirement of supplemental oxygen, or increased episodes of apnea or bradycardia. In a prospective study of preterm infants with BW less than 1500 g, the risk of apnea that lasted for more than 10 seconds rose with decreasing hematocrit values for both infants greater and less than 32 weeks gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-of-prematurity/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In addition, the frequency of apneic events detected by continuous monitoring of chest impedance and oxygen saturation decreased after red blood cell transfusion.</p><p>The following laboratory findings in addition to anemia are characteristic of AOP:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peripheral blood smear demonstrates normocytic and normochromic red blood cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The reticulocyte count is low, and red blood cell precursors in the bone marrow are decreased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-of-prematurity/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum concentrations of erythropoietin (EPO) are low in preterm infants during the first postnatal month compared with adults (9.7 versus 15.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/mL)</span> and remain inappropriately low for the extent of anemia through the second postnatal month [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-of-prematurity/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinicians who care for preterm infants should anticipate the development of anemia of prematurity (AOP). Optimal nutrition (eg, iron supplementation) should be provided and patients monitored for signs of anemia. Blood sampling should be limited to essential testing, and microtechniques should be used to minimize blood loss due to phlebotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-of-prematurity/abstract/19,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,35</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Blood loss from phlebotomy'</a> above.)</p><p>Red blood cell transfusions are primarily used to treat infants with AOP.

As a result, all preterm infants who are breastfed should receive iron supplementation of 2 to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day through the first year of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-of-prematurity/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Infants who receive iron-fortified formula need less additional supplementation than those who are exclusively breastfed, because for a given volume, iron-containing formula contains a higher concentration of iron than breast milk. Low iron-containing preterm formulas should not be used as they do not adequately provide the necessary iron required for these patients.

Thereafter, in healthy, growing preterm infants, it is not necessary to routinely monitor <span class=\"nowrap\">HCT/Hb</span>. Infants with persistent illness (eg, bronchopulmonary dysplasia) or surgical issues may require monitoring.</p><p>In asymptomatic infants, measuring a reticulocyte count at approximately four to six weeks after birth is used to evaluate whether a red blood cell (RBC) transfusion may be needed. Although no clearly defined biological markers have been identified to indicate when a RBC transfusion should be given in a preterm infant, an absolute reticulocyte <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;100,000/microL</span> (&lt;2 percent) is often used as a criterion for RBC transfusion in asymptomatic infants with a low HCT (less than 20 percent) or Hb (less than 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span>.

However, transfusion is a temporary measure and has the disadvantages of further inhibiting erythropoiesis and being associated with risks of transmitted infection, graft-versus-host disease, and toxic effects of anticoagulants or preservatives.

The indications for transfusions, specific blood products available for transfusion, and the administration of transfusion in the neonate are discussed in detail separately.

ESAs have also been proposed as neuroprotective agents that reduce poor long-term neurodevelopment outcome, however it is uncertain whether prophylactic administration is neuroprotective (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=long-term-neurodevelopmental-outcome-of-preterm-infants-epidemiology-and-risk-factors#H1722017090\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Long-term neurodevelopmental outcome of preterm infants: Epidemiology and risk factors&quot;, section on 'Potential neuroprotective agents'</a>). </p><p>However, the administration of EPO has not been accepted widely because it appears to have limited efficacy in decreasing the number of blood donors to which the infant is exposed via transfusion, whether EPO is administered early (within the first week of life) or late (at or after eight days of life). Data on the outcome of early and late EPO administration are presented in the following two sections.</p><p>A more effective approach to reduce the number of donor exposures for the preterm infant than routine administration of EPO is to limit the amount of blood drawn, follow restrictive guidelines for red blood cell transfusion, and to use satellite packs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-of-prematurity/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Satellite packs involve dividing one unit of donor blood into multiple smaller aliquots, which allows repeated transfusions from the same donor to the individual infant.

Many of these infants had received blood transfusions prior to enrollment in the trials. The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>EPO reduced the risk of receiving one or more red blood cell transfusions (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.74-0.85).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>EPO slightly reduced the number of red blood cell transfusions (weighted mean difference of -0.57, 95% CI -0.68 to -0.45).

In addition, infants in the EPO group had a lower risk of developing necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC, RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.52-91), neurodevelopmental impairment at 18 to 22 months' corrected age, intraventricular hemorrhage, and periventricular leukomalacia. &#160;</p><p/><p>In summary, early EPO is associated with only a small reduction in the number of transfusions, which is likely to be of limited benefit. In contrast to previous systematic review, there was no association between EPO and the risk of ROP stage &ge;3. In addition, EPO appears to have a neuroprotective effect but there are conflicting results, and the quality of the evidence for neurodevelopmental outcome at 18 to 22 months' corrected age was rated as poor. </p><p>Based on the available evidence, we recommend <strong>not</strong> to routinely administer EPO within the first eight days of life because the limited benefits do not warrant the cost of the intervention until there are further data that show a clinically significant neuroprotective effect. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Late EPO use</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Late administration of EPO reduces the number of transfusions, but the limited benefit does not justify its use. This was illustrated in a 2014 meta-analysis that evaluated the effects of late EPO administration (at or later than eight days of age) compared with placebo or no intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-of-prematurity/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Most of these infants had received blood transfusions prior to enrollment in the trials. The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>EPO reduced the risk of receiving one or more red blood cell transfusions (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.64-0.79).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>EPO reduced the number of red blood cell transfusions (weighted mean difference of -0.22, 95% CI -0.38 to -0.06).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There was no difference in the volume of blood transfused (mean difference -1.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg,</span> 95% CI -5.8 to 2.6).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>EPO had no effect on the rates for ROP, mortality, sepsis, intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), periventricular leukomalacia (PVL), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), hypertension, length of hospital stay, or long-term neurodevelopmental outcome. However, there was a trend towards an increased risk of ROP associated with EPO administration (RR 1.27, 95% CI 0.99-1.64). </p><p/><p>Late administration of EPO reduced the mean number of transfusions by a little less than one transfusion per infant. This small benefit of EPO was diminished due to the exposure of previous blood transfusions before eight days of life, and the use of satellite packs that would mitigate against additional donor exposure in the control group. As a result, we recommend NOT to routinely administer EPO after eight days because its limited benefit of limiting exposure to blood donors does not justify its cost.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H197405534\"><span class=\"h3\">Comparison early versus late use</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There appears to be no benefit of early EPO administration compared with late administration in reducing the number of transfusions, the amount of red cells transfused, or number of donor exposures per infant. This was illustrated in a meta-analysis of two trials (262 patients), which was updated in 2012, that found no statistical benefit of early EPO administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-of-prematurity/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Use of EPO in preterm infants appears to be safe.

In preterm infants, the decline occurs earlier, is more pronounced, and is called anemia of prematurity (AOP). AOP typically occurs at 3 to 12 weeks after birth in infants less than 32 weeks gestation. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other contributors to anemia in the preterm infant include iron depletion, blood loss due to phlebotomy, and a reduced red blood cell life span in preterm infants compared with that of full term infants and adults. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Other factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preterm infants are at particular risk for impaired oxygen delivery with anemia because of the increased likelihood of concomitant respiratory disease, high levels of hemoglobin F, and the need to avoid hyperoxia, which increases the risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Oxygen delivery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many infants remain asymptomatic despite having hemoglobin levels below 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span>. However, other infants may be symptomatic at similar or even higher hemoglobin levels. Symptoms include tachycardia, poor weight gain, increased requirement of supplemental oxygen, or increased frequency of apnea or bradycardia. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Clinical and laboratory features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The laboratory findings characteristic of AOP include normocytic and normochromic red blood cells, low reticulocyte count, and low erythropoietin levels. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Clinical and laboratory features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AOP may require treatment with red blood cell (RBC) transfusion. However, transfusion is a temporary measure and has potential adverse effects, such as infection and graft-versus-host disease. Guidelines for RBC transfusion based upon a restrictive policy in the neonate are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-transfusions-in-the-newborn#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell transfusions in the newborn&quot;, section on 'Indications'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Administration of recombinant human erythropoietin (EPO) appears to have limited efficacy in decreasing the number of blood donors to which the infant is exposed. It is a costly intervention, and the available evidence suggest limited clinical benefit. As a result, we recommend <strong>not</strong> to routinely administer EPO to preterm infants (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Erythropoiesis stimulating agents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A more effective approach to reduce the number of donor exposures for the preterm infant than routine administration of EPO is combination of limiting the amount of blood drawn, a restrictive policy for red cell transfusions, and the use of satellite packs, which allow for repeated transfusions from the same donor to the individual infant. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-transfusions-in-the-newborn#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell transfusions in the newborn&quot;, section on 'Target hemoglobin or hematocrit'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-transfusions-in-the-newborn#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell transfusions in the newborn&quot;, section on 'Administration'</a> and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H203863435\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Joyce M Koenig, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anemia-of-prematurity/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Ohls RK.
