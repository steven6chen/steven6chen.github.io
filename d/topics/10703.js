There is a narrow window during which this can be accomplished, since the benefit of reperfusion decreases over time.</p><p>This topic will review the use of mechanical thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke. The approach to reperfusion therapy for acute ischemic stroke, including the use of intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alteplase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alteplase</a> (recombinant tissue plasminogen activator or tPA), is reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-reperfusion-therapy-for-acute-ischemic-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to reperfusion therapy for acute ischemic stroke&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intravenous-thrombolytic-therapy-for-acute-ischemic-stroke-therapeutic-use\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intravenous thrombolytic therapy for acute ischemic stroke: Therapeutic use&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2890518052\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF REPERFUSION THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For eligible patients with acute ischemic stroke, intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alteplase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alteplase</a> (recombinant tissue plasminogen activator or tPA) is first-line therapy, provided that treatment is initiated within 4.5 hours of clearly defined symptom onset (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F71462\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71462 \">table 1</a>). Because the benefit of alteplase is time dependent, it is critical to treat patients as quickly as possible. Eligible patients should receive intravenous alteplase without delay even if mechanical thrombectomy is being considered. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intravenous-thrombolytic-therapy-for-acute-ischemic-stroke-therapeutic-use\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intravenous thrombolytic therapy for acute ischemic stroke: Therapeutic use&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Mechanical thrombectomy is indicated for patients with acute ischemic stroke due to a large artery occlusion in the anterior circulation who can be treated within 24 hours of the time last known to be well (ie, at neurologic baseline), regardless of whether they receive intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alteplase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alteplase</a> for the same ischemic stroke event, as discussed in the sections that follow.</p><p>Two issues may limit the widespread clinical use of mechanical thrombectomy. First, only an estimated 10 percent of patients with acute ischemic stroke have a proximal large artery occlusion in the anterior circulation and present early enough to qualify for mechanical thrombectomy within 6 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-thrombectomy-for-acute-ischemic-stroke/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. Second, only a few stroke centers have sufficient resources and expertise to deliver this therapy. However, eligible patients can receive standard treatment with intravenous tPA if they present to hospitals where thrombectomy is not an option, and those with qualifying anterior circulation strokes can then be transferred, a strategy called &quot;drip and ship&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-thrombectomy-for-acute-ischemic-stroke/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], to tertiary stroke centers where intra-arterial thrombectomy is available.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2703898498\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFICACY OF MECHANICAL THROMBECTOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early intra-arterial treatment with second-generation mechanical thrombectomy devices is safe and effective for reducing disability and is superior to standard treatment with intravenous thrombolysis alone for the treatment of acute ischemic stroke caused by a documented large artery occlusion in the proximal anterior circulation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F116247\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef116247 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F116248\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef116248 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3922659376\"><span class=\"h2\">Benefit of early treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Five multicenter, open-label randomized controlled trials (MR CLEAN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-thrombectomy-for-acute-ischemic-stroke/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], ESCAPE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-thrombectomy-for-acute-ischemic-stroke/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], SWIFT PRIME [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-thrombectomy-for-acute-ischemic-stroke/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], EXTEND-IA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-thrombectomy-for-acute-ischemic-stroke/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], and REVASCAT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-thrombectomy-for-acute-ischemic-stroke/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]) demonstrated that early intra-arterial treatment with second-generation mechanical thrombectomy devices is safe and effective for reducing disability and is superior to standard treatment with intravenous thrombolysis alone for ischemic stroke caused by a documented large artery occlusion in the proximal anterior circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-thrombectomy-for-acute-ischemic-stroke/abstract/1,11-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,11-17</a>]. The number needed to treat (NNT) for one additional person to achieve functional independence in these trials ranged from approximately 3 to 7.5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-thrombectomy-for-acute-ischemic-stroke/abstract/6-10,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-10,18,19</a>].</p><p>In a meta-analysis of these trials, with pooled patient-level data for 1287 subjects, the rate of functional independence (ie, a 90-day modified Rankin scale [mRS] score of 0 to 2) was significantly greater for the intervention group compared with the control group (46 versus 27 percent, odds ratio [OR] 2.35, 95% CI 1.85-2.98) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mechanical-thrombectomy-for-acute-ischemic-stroke/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Similarly, mechanical thrombectomy led to significantly reduced disability as indicated by an improvement of &ge;1 points on the mRS at 90 days (adjusted OR 2.49, 95% CI 1.76-3.53). Mechanical thrombectomy was beneficial across a wide range of patient subgroups, including age &ge;80 years, high initial stroke severity, and those not treated with intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alteplase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alteplase</a>. There was no significant difference between the mechanical thrombectomy and control groups for rates of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage or 90-day mortality.</p><p>When the positive results of the MR CLEAN trial were announced in late 2014, the remaining trials were stopped early on the basis of positive interim efficacy analyses.

The method of intra-arterial therapy was left to the discretion of the local interventionalist, but mechanical thrombectomy with retrievable stents was used in 82 percent. Approximately 90 percent of subjects in both groups received intravenous thrombolysis (median time to treatment: 80 minutes) prior to randomization. Assessment was blinded, and analysis was by intention-to-treat.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Compared with usual therapy, the group assigned to intra-arterial treatment had significantly improved outcomes at 90 days as determined by lower scores on the mRS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F75411\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75411 \">table 2</a>) (adjusted common odds ratio [OR] 1.67, 95% CI 1.21-2.30). The intra-arterial treatment group had a significantly higher rate of functional independence (ie, an mRS score of 0 to 2) at 90 days compared with usual treatment (32.6 versus 19.1 percent, absolute risk difference, 13.5 percent, 95% CI 5.9-21.2).

Among patients assigned to the thrombectomy group, the median time from symptom onset to first reperfusion was 241 minutes. At 90 days after treatment, the thrombectomy group had a significantly higher rate of functional independence (defined as an mRS score of 0 to 2) compared with the control group (53 versus 29 percent) and a significantly lower mortality rate (10 versus 19 percent). The NNT for one additional patient to achieve functional independence was 4.2.

Patients with large areas of infarction on advanced neuroimaging were excluded. At 90 days, thrombectomy led to a shift to lower disability levels on the mRS and to a significantly higher rate of functional independence, defined by an mRS of 0 to 2 (60 versus 35 percent).

Thrombectomy led to higher rates of functional independence at 90 days (44 versus 28 percent; NNT 6.3) and a reduction in disability over the range of the mRS (adjusted OR for a one point improvement in the mRS score, 1.7, 95% CI 1.05-2.8). There were no significant differences in the rates of symptomatic intracerebral hemorrhage or mortality.

Approximately 55 percent of the patients in the trial had a &quot;wake-up&quot; stroke (ie, they were last known to be well before going to bed and stroke symptoms were first noted upon awakening). Patients were randomly assigned to thrombectomy plus standard care or to standard care alone (control). The trial was stopped early for efficacy at the first interim analysis.

Approximately one-half of the patients in the trial had a &quot;wake-up&quot; stroke. Patients assigned to thrombectomy were treated with stent retrievers or aspiration catheters. At 90 days, the percentage of patients who were functionally independent, defined as a modified Rankin scale score of 0 to 2, was higher with endovascular therapy compared with medical therapy alone (45 versus 17 percent, difference 28 percent), and therefore the number needed to treat for one additional patient to achieve functional independence was 3.6.
