The goals of this plan are to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treat your coronary heart disease &ndash; Even after your CABG, some of the heart's blood vessels can still have areas that are narrow (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F61785\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61785 \">figure 1</a>). Also, your heart muscle might have been damaged before your CABG. Your doctor's plan can help lower the chances that these problems will affect your life in the future.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Help you feel better and have more energy</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12914316\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I take care of my wounds?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor or nurse will tell you how to take care of any wounds on your chest, legs, or arms. It's important to watch for signs of an infection, especially during the first 2 weeks after your surgery. Call your doctor or nurse right away if you have any of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever higher than 100.4&deg;F (38&deg;C)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>New pain or pain that is worse in your chest or around your chest wound</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A very fast heartbeat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A wound that is bleeding, draining pus, or has redness around it</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12914323\"><span class=\"h1\">Do I need to take medicines?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Most people need to take at least 2 heart medicines every day. Doctors can prescribe different types of heart medicines. The medicines can help you live longer and prevent blockages in your blood vessels from getting worse. Some also help treat chest pain and other heart symptoms.</p><p>If you have high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes (high blood sugar), your doctor will likely prescribe medicines to treat those conditions.</p><p>It's important to take your medicines exactly the way your doctor says. Let your doctor or nurse know if you have any side effects or problems with the medicines. You should also let him or her know if you can't afford your medicines. There are often ways to solve these problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12914330\"><span class=\"h1\">What is cardiac rehab?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cardiac rehab (short for &quot;cardiac rehabilitation&quot;) is a program that your doctor might recommend for you. At cardiac rehab, doctors, nurses, and other health professionals teach you how to keep your heart healthy. They will help you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercise safely &ndash; Getting regular exercise can help keep your heart healthy. Your doctor or nurse will work with you to make an exercise program that is safe for you. He or she will tell you how often and how hard to exercise.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Each time you exercise, make sure to warm up for 5 to 10 minutes first. Then you can do &quot;aerobic exercise&quot; for at least 20 minutes. Aerobic exercise raises your heart rate and includes activities such as walking, swimming, and jogging. After you work out, make sure to cool down for 5 to 10 minutes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Improve your diet &ndash; Eating the right foods can help keep your heart healthy. Fruits, vegetables, and foods with fiber can help prevent heart disease and strokes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F79063\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79063 \">figure 2</a>). Try to avoid eating foods that can make heart disease worse. These include &quot;trans&quot; fats, which are found in many fast foods. &quot;Saturated&quot; fats, which are found in red meats and many cheeses, can also worsen heart disease. Eating a healthy diet also means limiting white sugar.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lose weight, if you are overweight.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Quit smoking, if you smoke &ndash; Stopping smoking can lower your chance of getting or dying from heart disease. To quit, you can try nicotine patches, gum, or nasal sprays. (Nicotine is the main drug in cigarettes.) You can also try a prescription medicine to help stop cigarette cravings.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cope with feeling sad or worried &ndash; Many people feel sad or worried after CABG. Your doctor, nurse, or counselor can help you with these feelings and, if needed, treat your depression.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduce the stress in your life &ndash; Stress can worsen heart disease.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12914337\"><span class=\"h1\">When can I have sex again?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Check with your doctor about when it is safe to start having sex again. If you had a heart attack, the timing will depend on your heart attack and if you still have symptoms.</p><p>After CABG, some people are less interested in sex or do not enjoy sex as much. This can be a side effect of certain heart medicines. It can also happen if people are sad or worried about having a heart attack during sex. If you have problems with sex, let your doctor or nurse know. He or she might be able to treat those problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12914344\"><span class=\"h1\">When can I drive again?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Check with your doctor. He or she might not want you to drive again until your chest has healed from your surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12914351\"><span class=\"h1\">Which symptoms should I watch for?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It's important to watch for chest pain or symptoms of a heart attack (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F52579\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52579 \">figure 3</a>). But it is uncommon for people to have a heart attack in the months after CABG.</p><p>If you think you might be having a heart attack, <strong>call for an ambulance right away (in the US and Canada, dial 9-1-1)</strong>. Do not try to get to the hospital on your own.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12914358\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Coronary artery bypass graft surgery (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-attack-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Heart attack (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medicines-after-a-heart-attack-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medicines after a heart attack (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chest-pain-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chest pain (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=quitting-smoking-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Quitting smoking (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Exercise (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diet-and-health-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Diet and health (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-blood-pressure-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: High blood pressure in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-cholesterol-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: High cholesterol (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-for-type-2-diabetes-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Treatment for type 2 diabetes (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sex-problems-in-men-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Sex problems in men (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sex-problems-in-women-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Sex problems in women (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=reducing-the-costs-of-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Reducing the costs of medicines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=coronary-heart-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Coronary heart disease (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Coronary artery bypass graft surgery (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-cholesterol-and-lipids-hyperlipidemia-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: High cholesterol and lipids (hyperlipidemia) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diet-and-health-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Diet and health (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=quitting-smoking-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Quitting smoking (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-blood-pressure-treatment-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: High blood pressure treatment in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=preventing-complications-in-diabetes-mellitus-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Preventing complications in diabetes mellitus (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sexual-problems-in-men-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Sexual problems in men (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sexual-problems-in-women-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Sexual problems in women (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-attack-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Heart attack (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
