Unfortunately, the hospital environment is often poorly conducive to sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poor-sleep-in-the-hospital-contributing-factors-and-interventions/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Pain, anxiety, medication effects, medical interventions, and the acute illness itself all contribute to decreased quality and quantity of sleep in hospitalized patients. As a result, issues related to sleep and sleep disorders are important to inpatient care.</p><p>This review will discuss the evaluation, consequences, and management of sleep disturbances in hospitalized adult patients. The evaluation and management of obstructive sleep apnea and other sleep disorders in the inpatient setting is reviewed separately.

All of these changes become more pronounced with worsening severity of illness as well as in the immediate postoperative period. In some cases, sleep impairments persist well beyond the acute illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poor-sleep-in-the-hospital-contributing-factors-and-interventions/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2208521007\"><span class=\"h2\">Poor sleep quality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients regularly report poor quality sleep during hospitalization across a range of inpatient settings, perhaps most notably in the intensive care unit (ICU) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poor-sleep-in-the-hospital-contributing-factors-and-interventions/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. Impaired sleep quality has been cited by ICU patients as one of the main stressors during admission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poor-sleep-in-the-hospital-contributing-factors-and-interventions/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]</p><p>Small studies using inpatient polysomnography (PSG) have verified that ICU patients experience significant alterations in their sleep architecture, to an extent that traditional rules for scoring sleep stages may not be applicable in some critically ill patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poor-sleep-in-the-hospital-contributing-factors-and-interventions/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep is highly fragmented, with prolonged sleep latencies, frequent arousals, poor nocturnal sleep efficiency, an increase in stage 2 (N2) sleep, a reduction or absence of deep or slow wave (N3) sleep, and a reduction or absence of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poor-sleep-in-the-hospital-contributing-factors-and-interventions/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>REM sleep is often absent on the night following surgery, followed by a significant rebound of REM sleep on subsequent nights [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poor-sleep-in-the-hospital-contributing-factors-and-interventions/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p/><p>Circadian rhythm disturbances can be particularly severe in ICU patients. While patients in non-ICU settings tend to maintain typical circadian cycles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poor-sleep-in-the-hospital-contributing-factors-and-interventions/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], patients in the ICU may have circadian rhythms that are significantly delayed or even absent, particularly in very ill or septic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poor-sleep-in-the-hospital-contributing-factors-and-interventions/abstract/22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-25</a>]. The phase delay seen in some patients is likely related to a free-running circadian pacemaker [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poor-sleep-in-the-hospital-contributing-factors-and-interventions/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>] that may not be responsive to bright light [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poor-sleep-in-the-hospital-contributing-factors-and-interventions/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], the strongest external cue that helps align endogenous circadian rhythms with the environment. An absence or misalignment of the circadian rhythm with the sleep-wake cycle can result in fragmented and inadequate sleep.

For many acutely ill patients, sleep appears to be spread around the clock, with 40 to 60 percent of sleep occurring during typical waking daytime hours (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F107170\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef107170 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poor-sleep-in-the-hospital-contributing-factors-and-interventions/abstract/12,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,16,17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H319707057\"><span class=\"h2\">Consequences of poor sleep</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The consequences of acute and chronic sleep deprivation in the general population are increasingly recognized. Data on the impact of poor sleep quality and sleep loss during hospitalization are more limited, but many of the same effects observed in the general population are relevant to the inpatient setting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insufficient-sleep-definition-epidemiology-and-adverse-outcomes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Insufficient sleep: Definition, epidemiology, and adverse outcomes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cognitive and neurobehavioral consequences &ndash; Sleep deprivation leading to cognitive impairment and neurobehavioral changes is well documented in the outpatient setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poor-sleep-in-the-hospital-contributing-factors-and-interventions/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. These consequences have not been systematically studied in inpatients, where it is often more difficult to discern a cause and effect relationship. While it has long been postulated that a lack of sleep in the ICU setting may be a risk factor for delirium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poor-sleep-in-the-hospital-contributing-factors-and-interventions/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], the association between the two conditions remains to be defined in hospitalized patients, and more studies are needed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Respiratory function &ndash; Acute sleep deprivation under experimental conditions impairs several parameters of respiratory function, including chemosensitivity and control of ventilation, genioglossus muscle activity, inspiratory muscle endurance, and spirometry (in patients with chronic obstructive lung disease) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poor-sleep-in-the-hospital-contributing-factors-and-interventions/abstract/29-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-32</a>]. In a study of 27 patients admitted to the medical ICU for hypercapnic respiratory failure requiring noninvasive ventilation, early sleep disturbances on days 2 to 4 of admission were risk factors for late noninvasive ventilation failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poor-sleep-in-the-hospital-contributing-factors-and-interventions/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immune function and inflammation &ndash; The role of sleep deprivation in immune function has been studied in animal models and otherwise healthy humans, suggesting a link between sleep loss and impaired immune function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poor-sleep-in-the-hospital-contributing-factors-and-interventions/abstract/34-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-38</a>].

Noise levels in the hospital routinely exceed those recommended by the World Health Organization for a good night's sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poor-sleep-in-the-hospital-contributing-factors-and-interventions/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Studies using polysomnography in the intensive care unit (ICU) have found that about 10 to 20 percent of arousals can be attributed to noise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poor-sleep-in-the-hospital-contributing-factors-and-interventions/abstract/12,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2177843044\"><span class=\"h3\">Patient care interventions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Caring for acute illness requires numerous patient interactions with the potential to disrupt sleep, and the frequency of patient care interactions for vital signs, blood draws, diagnostic testing, and treatments increases with the severity of illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poor-sleep-in-the-hospital-contributing-factors-and-interventions/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>Rearrangement of workflows could conceivably reduce some of these interruptions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poor-sleep-in-the-hospital-contributing-factors-and-interventions/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>], although the magnitude of the potential benefit may be relatively small. In a prospective observational study of nocturnal nursing interactions, 14 percent of the nursing interventions could have been safely omitted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poor-sleep-in-the-hospital-contributing-factors-and-interventions/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. In another study of seven mechanically ventilated patients monitored with polysomnography (PSG), only 7 percent of arousals and awakenings were recognized as being from patient care interruptions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poor-sleep-in-the-hospital-contributing-factors-and-interventions/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1693416981\"><span class=\"h3\">Light exposure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients in the ICU often report nocturnal light exposure as one of the more important factors disrupting their sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poor-sleep-in-the-hospital-contributing-factors-and-interventions/abstract/9,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,44</a>]. Just as important may be inadequate levels of daytime light.</p><p>Several studies have found relatively low levels of nocturnal light exposure in the ICU (&lt;2 to 4 lux), which would be in the range conducive to sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poor-sleep-in-the-hospital-contributing-factors-and-interventions/abstract/18,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,25</a>]. However, the same studies also found relatively low levels of average daytime light exposure (70 to 80 lux). These levels are equivalent to a dim light environment in which entrainment of circadian rhythms may be lost.

Among the various drugs and classes, melatonin is often the best first-line choice, based on its mild side effect profile, low potential for drug-drug interactions, and potential to improve circadian rhythms. It should be noted, however, that the sleep-inducing properties of melatonin are variable and may not be as robust as other sleep aids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poor-sleep-in-the-hospital-contributing-factors-and-interventions/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Melatonin and melatonin receptor agonists &ndash; Several small studies in hospitalized patients and in simulated environments have found improvements in sleep and sleep quality (subjective and as measured by actigraphy) with 1 to 5 mg of melatonin at night [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poor-sleep-in-the-hospital-contributing-factors-and-interventions/abstract/67-69\" class=\"abstract_t\">67-69</a>]. Melatonin is well tolerated, and proper timing of the dose may help to regulate circadian rhythms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">While dosing is not standardized and there may be variability across different formulations, a typical dose is 1 to 3 mg scheduled at 9 to 10 PM, depending on the patient's habitual bedtime. Immediate release melatonin preparations should be given 30 to 60 minutes before bedtime, and sustained release preparations should be given one to two hours before bedtime. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiology-and-available-preparations-of-melatonin#H722736508\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiology and available preparations of melatonin&quot;, section on 'Melatonin preparations'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Melatonin receptor agonists such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ramelteon-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ramelteon</a> have not been examined for their effects on inpatient sleep, although limited data suggest that they may play a role in preventing delirium in older adult inpatients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poor-sleep-in-the-hospital-contributing-factors-and-interventions/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].

In a small observational study of hospitalized psychiatric patients, trazodone appeared to be a more effective sleep aid than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quetiapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quetiapine</a> based on patient-reported and nursing-observed sleep outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poor-sleep-in-the-hospital-contributing-factors-and-interventions/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The most common side effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trazodone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trazodone</a> are headache, dry mouth, and nausea. Additional potential side effects relevant to the inpatient population include orthostatic hypotension and infrequent atrial and ventricular arrhythmias, and thus caution should be used in patients at risk for these problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poor-sleep-in-the-hospital-contributing-factors-and-interventions/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. When trazodone is used, we suggest starting at a low dose (eg, 50 mg at bedtime) with close attention to drug-drug interactions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonbenzodiazepines &ndash; The nonbenzodiazepine benzodiazepine receptor agonists (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zolpidem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zolpidem</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zopiclone-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zopiclone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zaleplon-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zaleplon</a>) are effective sleep aids in the outpatient setting and commonly used in the inpatient setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poor-sleep-in-the-hospital-contributing-factors-and-interventions/abstract/64,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,72</a>].

Common disturbances include fragmentation of sleep, altered sleep architecture with decreases in slow wave (N3) and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and disruption of circadian rhythms. The most severe disturbances are observed in the intensive care unit (ICU) setting. (See <a href=\"#H478894605\" class=\"local\">'Sleep disturbances in the hospital'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indirect evidence from the general population suggests that substandard sleep in the hospital could lead to adverse effects on cognition, neurobehavioral outcomes, respiratory function, and immune function. In addition, sleep deprivation has been proposed as a risk factor for delirium. (See <a href=\"#H319707057\" class=\"local\">'Consequences of poor sleep'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Common factors implicated in poor sleep in the hospital include noise, patient care interventions, light, the illness itself (eg, pain, anxiety, fever), and treatments for disease (eg, medications, ventilators). (See <a href=\"#H1999222073\" class=\"local\">'Environmental factors'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3888663661\" class=\"local\">'Nonenvironmental factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A variety of interventions to improve sleep in the inpatient setting have been proposed, but most are lacking sufficient clinical evidence to support widespread use. Relatively simple, low-risk interventions that do not require intensive investment in new resources include the following (see <a href=\"#H3477856440\" class=\"local\">'Interventions to improve sleep'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Evaluate for underlying sleep disorders</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Address diseases and symptoms interfering with sleep</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Reduce noise at night</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Establish a clear <span class=\"nowrap\">day/night</span> light exposure protocol consistent with environmental norms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Use simple relaxation techniques (eg, music, relaxation tapes)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Limit patient interactions during typical sleep hours to those that are truly required for patient care</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Review medication lists daily and eliminate or choose alternative medications in place of those that may interfere with sleep quality</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pharmacologic sleep aids should be used judiciously in the inpatient setting. When pharmacologic therapy is deemed necessary, selection of an agent should be individualized based on severity of symptoms, age and comorbidities, side effects, and drug-drug interactions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We suggest melatonin as a first-line agent in most inpatients, based on its tolerability, low potential for drug-drug interactions, and potential to improve circadian rhythms (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). However, the sleep-inducing effects of melatonin are variable and may not be as robust as other sleep aids.
