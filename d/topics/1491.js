It can occur in infants, children, and adults, and seems more common in certain families. Eczema can be treated with moisturizers and prescription ointments.</p><p>More detailed information about atopic dermatitis is available by subscription. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-atopic-dermatitis-eczema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of atopic dermatitis (eczema)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-severe-atopic-dermatitis-eczema-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of severe atopic dermatitis (eczema) in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ECZEMA CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cause of eczema is not completely understood, although hereditary factors appear to play a strong role. In most people, atopic dermatitis is caused by a genetic dysfunction in the outermost layer of the skin (the epidermis). The epidermis is the first line of defense between the body and the environment. When the epidermis is intact, it keeps environmental irritants, allergens, and microbes from entering the body.</p><p>Despite popular belief, in children, eczema is rarely linked to food allergies. If a food allergy is suspected, the child should be evaluated by an allergy specialist. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-allergy-symptoms-and-diagnosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Food allergy symptoms and diagnosis (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=role-of-allergy-in-atopic-dermatitis-eczema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Role of allergy in atopic dermatitis (eczema)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ECZEMA SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people with eczema develop their first symptoms before age five. Intense itching of the skin, patches of redness, small bumps, and skin flaking are common. Scratching can cause additional skin inflammation, which can further worsen the itching. The itchiness may be more noticeable at nighttime.</p><p>Features of eczema vary from one individual to another, and can change over time. Although eczema is usually confined to specific areas of the body, it may affect multiple areas in severe cases:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In infants, there may be red, scaly, and crusted areas on the front of the arms and legs, cheeks, or scalp. The diaper area is not usually affected.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In children and adults, eczema commonly affects the back of the neck, the elbow creases, and the backs of the knees (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F57650\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57650 \">picture 1</a>). Other affected areas may include the face, wrists, and forearms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F81398\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81398 \">picture 2</a>). The skin may become thickened and darkened, or even scarred, from repeated scratching.</p><p/><p>The skin can also become infected as a result of scratching. Signs of infection include painful red bumps that sometimes contain pus; a healthcare provider should be consulted if this occurs.</p><p>Other findings in people with eczema can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dry, scaly skin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plugged hair follicles causing small bumps to develop, usually on the face, upper arms, and thighs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased skin creasing on the palms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an extra fold of skin under the eye</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Darkening of the skin around the eyes</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ECZEMA DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no specific test used to diagnose eczema. The diagnosis is usually based upon a person's medical history and physical examination.</p><p>Factors that strongly suggest eczema include long-standing and recurrent itching, a personal or family history of allergic conditions, and an early age when symptoms began. Other factors include worsened symptoms after exposure to certain triggers or any of the skin findings noted above.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">ECZEMA TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Eczema is a chronic condition; it typically improves and then flares (worsens) periodically. Some people have no symptoms for several years. Eczema is not curable, although symptoms can be controlled with a variety of self-care measures and drug therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Who treats eczema?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many patients with atopic dermatitis can initially be treated by their primary care provider. However, a skin specialist (dermatologist) may be recommended in certain situations, such as if the condition does not improve with treatment, if certain areas of the body are affected (face or skin folds), and if another condition could be causing symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Eliminate aggravating factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Eliminating factors that worsen eczema can help to control the symptoms. Aggravating factors may include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heat, perspiration, dry environments</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Emotional stress or anxiety</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rapid temperature changes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exposure to certain chemicals or cleaning solutions, including soaps and detergents, perfumes and cosmetics, wool or synthetic fibers, dust, sand, and cigarette smoke</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Keep the skin hydrated</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Emollients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Emollients are creams and ointments that moisturize the skin and prevent it from drying out. The best emollients for people with atopic dermatitis are thick creams (such as Eucerin, Cetaphil, and Nutraderm) or ointments (such as petroleum jelly, Aquaphor, and Vaseline), which contain little to no water. Emollients are most effective when applied immediately after bathing. Emollients can be applied twice a day or more often if needed. Lotions contain more water than creams and ointments and are less effective for moisturizing the skin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Bathing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is not clear if showers or baths are better for keeping the skin hydrated. Lukewarm baths or showers can hydrate and cool the skin, temporarily relieving the itching of eczema. An unscented, mild soap or nonsoap cleanser (such as Cetaphil) should be used sparingly. An emollient should be applied <strong>immediately</strong> after bathing or showering to prevent the skin from drying out as a result of water evaporation.</p><p>However, hot or long baths (greater than 10 to 15 minutes) and showers should be avoided since they can dry out the skin.</p><p>In some cases, healthcare providers may recommend dilute bleach baths for people with eczema. These baths help to decrease the number of bacteria on the skin that can cause infections or worsen symptoms. To prepare a bleach bath, &frac14; to &frac12; cup of bleach is placed in a full bathtub (about 40 gallons) of water. Bleach baths are usually taken for five to ten minutes twice per week.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Treat skin irritation</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Topical steroids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prescription steroid (corticosteroid) creams and ointments may be recommended to control mild to moderate atopic dermatitis. Steroid creams and ointments are available in a variety of strengths (potencies); the least potent are available without a prescription (eg, hydrocortisone 1% cream). More potent formulations require a prescription.</p><p>Steroid creams or ointments are usually applied to the skin once or twice per day. These help to reduce symptoms and moisturize the skin. As the skin improves, a non-medicated emollient can be resumed. Strong topical steroids may be needed to control severe flares of eczema; however, these should be used for only short periods of time to prevent thinning of the skin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Other skin treatments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Newer skin treatments for eczema include tacrolimus (Protopic) and pimecrolimus (Elidel). These are effective in controlling eczema, although they do not work as quickly as topical steroids. They are useful in sensitive areas such as the face and groin, and can be used in children over age two. Due to safety concerns, these treatments should only be used as instructed by a healthcare provider.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Oral steroids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oral steroids (eg, prednisone) occasionally are used to treat a severe flare of eczema, although this treatment is not usually recommended on a regular basis because of potential side effects.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Ultraviolet light therapy (phototherapy)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultraviolet light therapy (phototherapy) can effectively control atopic dermatitis. However, this therapy is expensive, may increase a person's risk for skin cancer, and is therefore recommended only for people with severe eczema who do not respond to other treatments.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Immunosuppressive drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Drugs that weaken the immune system may be recommended for people with severe eczema who do not improve with other treatments. Treatment with these drugs can cause serious side effects, including an increased risk for infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2962670883\"><span class=\"h3\">Injectable medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The injectable &quot;biologic&quot; medication dupilumab (brand name: Dupixent), which targets the immune system, may be beneficial for treating atopic dermatitis. Due to its high cost and potential side effects, this drug is reserved for adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis that has not responded to other treatments.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Control itching</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Oral antihistamines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oral antihistamines sometimes help relieve the itching of eczema. The over-the-counter antihistamine diphenhydramine (Benadryl), and prescription antihistamines, such as hydroxyzine (Atarax) and cyproheptadine, are most effective for itching caused by eczema, although these drugs can cause drowsiness. </p><p>The nonsedating antihistamines such as cetirizine (Zyrtec) and loratadine (Claritin) may relieve symptoms, and both are available without a prescription in the United States.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Wet dressings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Wet dressings help soothe and hydrate the skin, reduce itching and redness, loosen crusted areas, and prevent skin injury from scratching. Dampened cotton garments may be worn over the affected area and covered with a dry garment. The person may wear these dressings overnight or change them every eight hours during the day.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H252828840\"><span class=\"h2\">Can eczema be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Babies who have a parent, brother, or sister with eczema have a high risk of developing atopic eczema. In these babies, the use of moisturizing creams or ointments from the first week of life may prevent eczema during the first year. However, it is uncertain whether this measure is effective in preventing eczema later in life.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your healthcare provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your medical problem.</p><p>This article will be updated as needed on our website (<a href=\"http://www.uptodate.com/patients&amp;token=nygaOTnDuGxGrKiuwLIxjMIsa91xyzRx3QvmgfDh4FTTVfpiGy3XGWFyzaLmJXXU&amp;TOPIC_ID=7638\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.uptodate.com/patients</a>).
