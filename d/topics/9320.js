Restenosis is a gradual re-narrowing of the stented segment that occurs mostly between 3 to 12 months after stent placement. It usually presents as recurrent angina, but can present as acute myocardial infarction in approximately 10 percent of patients. It can usually be managed by repeat percutaneous revascularization.</p><p>In contrast, stent thrombosis is an abrupt thrombotic occlusion of a previously widely patent stent. It is a catastrophic complication that presents as sudden death or large myocardial infarction in most patients. Despite successful repeat revascularization, the six-month mortality is high. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coronary-artery-stent-thrombosis-clinical-presentation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coronary artery stent thrombosis: Clinical presentation and management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coronary-artery-stent-thrombosis-incidence-and-risk-factors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coronary artery stent thrombosis: Incidence and risk factors&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In this topic, intracoronary stent restenosis (ISR) and in-stent restenosis refer to the same issue.</p><p>The following are widely agreed upon definitions related to ISR (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56696\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56696 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracoronary-stent-restenosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Restenosis</strong> &ndash; A reduction in lumen diameter after percutaneous coronary intervention due to arterial damage and subsequent neointimal tissue proliferation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Binary angiographic restenosis</strong> &ndash; A &ge;50 percent luminal narrowing at follow-up angiography.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Clinical restenosis</strong> &ndash; The presence of both binary angiographic restenosis and clinical symptoms or signs of ischemia (either at rest or with stress) <strong>OR</strong> restenosis with a &ge;70 percent reduction in lumen diameter even in the absence of clinical symptoms or signs.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE OF RESTENOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of restenosis depends on the definition of restenosis (see <a href=\"#H1558346535\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above), type of stent, and the complexity of the lesion(s) stented. Restenosis rates are considerably higher in more complex lesion subsets, such as small vessels, long lesions, and bifurcations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-intracoronary-stents-for-specific-coronary-lesions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of intracoronary stents for specific coronary lesions&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bare metal stents</strong> &ndash; A pooled analysis of 6186 patients from six major clinical trials assessed current generation bare metal stents (BMS). The frequency of clinical restenosis was defined as target lesion or target vessel revascularization (TVR) beyond 30 days, death, or myocardial infarction in the target vessel territory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracoronary-stent-restenosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. At one year, target lesion revascularization (TLR) was performed in 12 percent and TVR in 14.1 percent. These values were more than two-thirds higher than those at six months (6.9 and 8 percent). Clinically relevant restenosis occurred in only about one-half of patients with angiographic restenosis (defined as &ge;50 percent diameter stenosis). This was mostly a matter of degree, since 50 to 70 percent angiographic stenosis is unlikely to cause symptoms. The incidence of TLR was much higher with more than 70 percent diameter stenosis (73 versus 26 percent for less than 60 percent diameter stenosis). The predictors of both clinical and angiographic restenosis were the same (smaller post-treatment lumen diameter, stent length, and diabetes).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Clinical restenosis with second-generation BMS is a relatively early event, most often becoming clinically evident within the first 6 to 12 months after the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracoronary-stent-restenosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. After one year, recurrent ischemia is more likely to be due to new or progressive disease at another site rather than restenosis. The magnitude of this difference was illustrated in a review of 1228 patients who were followed for five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracoronary-stent-restenosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. After the first year, the annual hazard rate was 1.7 percent for target lesion events compared with 6.3 percent for nontarget lesion events.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Drug-eluting stents</strong> &ndash; The rate of intracoronary stent restenosis (ISR) has been reported between 3 to 20 percent, depending on which drug-eluting stent (DES) is evaluated, the duration of follow-up, and the complexity of the lesions in which the stents were placed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracoronary-stent-restenosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Typically, neointimal proliferation is distributed uniformly along the length of the stent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracoronary-stent-restenosis/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>], but may also be relatively focal. The neointimal proliferation occurs in association with macrophage accumulation and extensive neovascularization, suggesting a role for organization of mural thrombus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracoronary-stent-restenosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Consistent with this hypothesis are the pathologic findings in 55 stents in 35 coronary arteries from patients who died, had repeat coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, or underwent transplantation. The mean duration of stent placement was 39 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracoronary-stent-restenosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The following abnormalities were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fibrin, platelets, and neutrophils, indicating thrombus formation and acute inflammation, have been demonstrated at stent struts evaluated &le;11 days after placement. Inflammation was more pronounced in struts that were embedded in a lipid core and those in contact with damaged media.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stents evaluated at a later time showed neointimal growth that increased as the ratio of stent area to reference lumen area increased. Neointimal thickness was greater for struts associated with medial damage than for those in contact with plaque. Over time, extracellular matrix accumulation may play a greater role than cell proliferation in neointimal thickening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracoronary-stent-restenosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p>Although there is an increase in neointimal tissue with subsequent reduction in the minimal luminal diameter during the first six months after stent placement, there may be no further reduction in luminal diameter or even regression at one year and a further increase in diameter at later time points [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracoronary-stent-restenosis/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. Serial angiography and angioscopy found the following sequence of changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracoronary-stent-restenosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. There was initial thickening of the neointima that became nontransparent at six months. Thereafter, the neointima became thin and transparent (ie, the majority of the stent was visible).

The diagnosis of intracoronary stent restenosis (ISR) is confirmed by coronary angiography, usually performed as a prelude to repeat catheter-based therapy in the same sitting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=angina-pectoris-chest-pain-caused-by-myocardial-ischemia#H358110146\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Angina pectoris: Chest pain caused by myocardial ischemia&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p>An appreciable proportion of patients with bare metal stents (BMS) can present with an acute coronary syndrome (3 to 20 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracoronary-stent-restenosis/abstract/45-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-47</a>]. A similarly high frequency of acute coronary syndrome (mostly unstable angina) has been noted with restenosis in drug-eluting stents (DES). In two small reports of patients with DES restenosis, 27 and 50 percent presented with a diagnosis of unstable angina pectoris and 5 and 11 percent presented with myocardial infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracoronary-stent-restenosis/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>].

The role of surgery in the treatment of ISR is uncertain. Revascularization with coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery should be considered in patients who are deemed to not be candidates for percutaneous intervention or who meet the established criteria for its use in patients with stable angina. Patient preference plays an important role in decision-making at the time of symptomatic ISR. The relative benefits and risks of medical, percutaneous, and surgical treatments need to be discussed. In particular, the need for long-term dual antiplatelet therapy (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and platelet P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor blocker) with DES must be understood by the patient.

Percutaneous coronary intervention using other techniques such as plain old balloon angioplasty placement of a BMS, or intracoronary radiation, is performed less often. The use of drug-eluting balloon (DEB) angioplasty, rather than placement of a newer generation DES is reasonable in those locations where the device is available.</p><p>Specialized revascularization devices, such as rotational or directional atherectomy and laser angioplasty are used infrequently to treat ISR.

The various potential percutaneous coronary interventional (PCI) techniques of plain old balloon angioplasty, bare metal stenting, or older generation stenting, newer generation stenting (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F65603\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65603 \">table 3</a>), atherectomy, brachytherapy, and DEBs, have been compared in multiple studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracoronary-stent-restenosis/abstract/22,50-68\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,50-68</a>].</p><p>These studies have established the superiority of newer generation DES to all other PCI devices. A 2015 well-performed network meta-analysis evaluated 27 trials (n = 5923) which compared everolimus-eluting stent with one or more of the other devices and noted the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intracoronary-stent-restenosis/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The primary end point of percent diameter stenosis at angiographic follow-up occurred less often with everolimus-eluting stents: -9 percent (95% CI -15.8 to -2.2) compared with drug-coated balloon; -9.4 percent (95% CI -17.4 to -1.4 percent) compared with sirolimus-eluting stents; -10.2 percent (95% CI -18.4 to -2 percent) compared with paclitaxel-eluting stents; -19.2 (95% CI -28.2 to -10.4 percent) compared with vascular brachytherapy; -23.4 percent (95% CI &ndash;36.2 to -10.8 percent) compared with BMS; -24. 2 percent (95% CI -32.2 to -16.4 percent) compared with balloon angioplasty; and -31.8 percent (95% CI -44.8 to -18.6 percent) compared with a rotablator.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PCI with everolimus-eluting stents was associated with a lower risk of target lesion revascularization (TLR) than all other strategies.</p><p/><p>Despite the apparent superiority of the everolimus-eluting stents compared with a DEB, we believe it has some role, particularly as the network meta-analysis discussed above suggests, that it may be superior to other devices.
