When idiopathic, NSIP is considered one of the idiopathic interstitial pneumonias (IIPs), which also include usual interstitial pneumonia <span class=\"nowrap\">(UIP)/idiopathic</span> pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), desquamative interstitial pneumonia (DIP), respiratory bronchiolitis-associated interstitial lung disease (RB-ILD), acute interstitial pneumonia (AIP), and cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F95445\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95445 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-nonspecific-interstitial-pneumonia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Others have responded to systemic glucocorticoids in combination with antiretroviral therapy (ART). In the absence of more definitive data, a reasonable approach, after careful exclusion of infection (eg, <em>Pneumocystis jirovecii</em>,<em> Histoplasma</em>, mycobacteria, cytomegalovirus), is to initiate ART and reserve systemic glucocorticoids for patients who fail to improve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-nonspecific-interstitial-pneumonia/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1995991239\"><span class=\"h2\">Supportive care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In terms of supportive care, current smokers should be strongly advised to stop smoking; seasonal influenza and pneumococcal vaccination should be offered as appropriate.

These patients typically have few symptoms (eg, dyspnea with moderate exertion) and minimal impairment on pulmonary function testing. For these patients, it may be reasonable to defer therapy until there is evidence of disease progression. This approach has not been formally studied and should be limited to patients with mild, stable disease with close follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-nonspecific-interstitial-pneumonia/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H141008111\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL THERAPY FOR MODERATE TO SEVERE DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For the majority of patients with NSIP who have moderate symptoms and impairment on pulmonary function testing, and also diffuse abnormalities on high resolution computed tomography (HRCT), we suggest initiation of systemic glucocorticoids. This advice is based on observational data and our clinical experience. As the experience treating NSIP in patients with a known connective tissue disease is greater than for idiopathic NSIP, some of the choices are based on extrapolation. </p><p>For most such patients, addition of a second immunosuppressive agent is deferred for three to six months, so the response to glucocorticoid therapy can be assessed.
