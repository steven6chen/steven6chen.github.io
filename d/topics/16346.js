This clone of plasma cells proliferates in the bone marrow and often results in extensive skeletal destruction with osteolytic lesions, osteopenia, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fractures.</p><p>This topic review will discuss the staging and prognostic studies used in multiple myeloma. The pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and the different modalities used for therapy are discussed separately.

The prognosis of patients with myeloma, as in most other cancers, is dependent on four key factors: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Staging (tumor burden)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient factors (host characteristics)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disease biology (aggressiveness of the disease)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Availability and response to therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognostic-studies-in-multiple-myeloma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] </p><p/><p>Of these four key factors, information on staging, patient factors, and disease biology can be identified by prognostic studies at the outset and are discussed in this topic. On the other hand, response to therapy can only be known after the patient has started therapy and is complicated by the fact that rapidity and completeness of the response may not always correlate with good outcome. Most of the data regarding prognostic studies in myeloma patients come from evaluations at the time of diagnosis. It is unclear how many of these factors may affect outcomes in previously treated patients. In addition, it is not clear how the prognostic value of these factors will change with the emergence of new therapies.</p><p>Prognostic studies have numerous benefits in both the clinical and research setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognostic-studies-in-multiple-myeloma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Two main staging systems exist: the International staging system (ISS) and the Durie-Salmon staging system. Of these, the ISS has become the preferred staging system because of its simplicity and lack of subjectivity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F99030\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef99030 \">figure 2</a>). These staging systems are predominantly used to stratify patients enrolled in clinical trials and allow clinicians to better interpret and compare such trials. Other prognostic studies, such as bone marrow cytogenetics and studies of chromosomal translocations are more frequently used to determine the preferred treatment approach.

It incorporates data on the levels of serum beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) and serum albumin to divide disease burden into three stages with prognostic significance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognostic-studies-in-multiple-myeloma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage I &ndash; B2M &lt;3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span> and serum albumin &ge;3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage II &ndash; neither stage I nor stage III</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage III &ndash; B2M &ge;5.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span></p><p/><p>Median overall survival for patients with ISS stages I, II, and III were 62, 44, and 29 months, respectively.</p><p>The ISS should be used only in patients with symptomatic, overt myeloma; it should not be used in patients with smoldering myeloma or monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) since its value in such populations is not known. Unlike the Durie-Salmon staging system, the ISS is not a reliable indicator of tumor burden; both albumin and B2M that form the basis of the ISS are also affected by patient factors, such as renal failure and comorbidities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H68873188\"><span class=\"h2\">Revised ISS (R-ISS)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The revised International Staging System (R-ISS) incorporates the factors included in the original ISS (serum B2M and serum albumin), while adding prognostic information obtained from the serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and high-risk chromosomal abnormalities detected by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) after CD138 plasma cell purification.</p><p>The R-ISS was developed based on 3060 patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma enrolled onto one of 11 international trials with data regarding ISS, FISH, and LDH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognostic-studies-in-multiple-myeloma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Treatment included autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (65 percent), immunomodulatory agents (66 percent), and proteasome inhibitors (44 percent). Using this information, patients were stratified into three risk groups with significantly different estimated rates of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) at five years (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F105116\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef105116 \">figure 3</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>R-ISS I (n = 871) &ndash; ISS stage I (B2M &lt;3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span> and serum albumin &ge;3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span> and normal LDH and no del(17p), t(4;14), or t(14;16) by FISH.

Validation in a separate cohort has not been performed. The R-ISS provides prognostic information that is more robust than that from the original ISS. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Durie-Salmon staging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Durie-Salmon clinical staging system incorporates several factors correlating with tumor cell mass. Using this method, stage is determined based upon a subjective measure of tumor cell density in the bone marrow along with measures of end organ damage (renal insufficiency, anemia, hypercalcemia, lytic bone lesions) and immunoglobulin burden (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F56890\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56890 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognostic-studies-in-multiple-myeloma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. While it is a standardized system for the staging of multiple myeloma, the Durie-Salmon staging system has a number of shortcomings relating to its ability to predict prognosis and survival. As an example, this system incorporates the observer-dependent quantitation of lytic lesions on skeletal survey. Including subjective measures decreases its precision.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1902470566\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical outcome for patients with myeloma depends upon a complex interaction between biologic features of the plasma cell clone and patient specific factors such as age, performance status, and comorbidities. Patients with comorbidities that limit their ability to withstand treatment will have a poor outcome even if they have a myeloma with features commonly associated with a better prognosis. While much of the research evaluating prognosis in myeloma has focused on the biologic properties of the malignant clone, large case series have identified numerous prognostic factors in patients with myeloma, some of which are patient dependent factors. </p><p>As an example, univariate analysis of a series of 1027 patients with multiple myeloma seen at the Mayo Clinic between 1985 and 1998, uncovered the following significant adverse prognostic risk factors for survival (relative risks in parentheses) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognostic-studies-in-multiple-myeloma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Performance status 3 or 4 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F72901\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72901 \">table 2</a>) (1.9)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum albumin &lt;3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> (1.7)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age &ge;70 years (1.5)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum creatinine &ge;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1.5)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Platelet count <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;150,000/microL</span> (1.5)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beta-2 microglobulin &gt;4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L</span> (1.5)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plasma cell labeling index &ge;1 percent (1.5)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum calcium &ge;11 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (1.3)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemoglobin &lt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> (1.3)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bone marrow plasma cell percentage &ge;50 percent (1.2)</p><p/><p>Among the prognostic factors listed above, patient factors such as performance status, albumin concentration, and age appear to have as much or higher prognostic value than many of the disease-related factors.</p><p>Geriatricians commonly measure functional status by evaluating basic activities of daily living (ADLs), instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs), and the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI). ADLs are the skills that are necessary for basic living and include feeding, grooming, transferring, and toileting. IADLs are required to live independently in the community and include activities such as shopping, managing finances, housekeeping, preparing meals, and taking medications. The CCI is a measure of comorbidities. A study by the International Myeloma Working Group used ADLs, IADLs, CCI, and age to quantitate patient frailty in 869 patients with multiple myeloma (median age 74 years) enrolled on three trials of initial therapy that did not incorporate transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognostic-studies-in-multiple-myeloma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. This evaluation discriminated three groups (fit, intermediate frail, frail). When compared with fit patients, frail patients had significantly inferior overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] 3.57), shorter progression-free survival (HR 1.68), higher rates of treatment discontinuation (HR 2.27), and more grade <span class=\"nowrap\">3/4/5</span> non-hematologic toxicity (HR 1.74). Prospective studies are needed to better define how these measures can be incorporated into clinical practice.</p><p>Another analysis of 10,549 patients reported that patients older than 50 years had significantly shorter survival when treated with either chemotherapy alone or high-dose therapy followed by transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognostic-studies-in-multiple-myeloma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. While younger patients tended to present with more favorable features, age at diagnosis itself was an independent predictor of overall survival. A subsequent analysis of the same patient cohort with a median follow-up time of 3.25 years reported mean overall survival times of 6.3, 6.4, 5.3, 4.3, 3.4, and 2.5 years for those patients &lt;40, 40 to 49, 50 to 59, 60 to 69, 70 to 79, and &ge;80 years at the time of diagnosis, respectively, indicating that although younger patients have better survival, the number of years of life lost was greater [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognostic-studies-in-multiple-myeloma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H333134\"><span class=\"h1\">DISEASE BIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In multiple myeloma, prognosis can be markedly different in patients with similar staging and host factors. These disparities are driven primarily by differences in underlying disease biology. These factors can greatly influence the aggressiveness of the clinical course. Some of the most important markers of disease biology include cytogenetic abnormalities, bone marrow plasma cell immunophenotype, plasma cell proliferative rate, and circulating plasma cells.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Cytogenetic abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cytogenetic abnormalities are powerful prognostic factors in myeloma. A combination of conventional cytogenetics and interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is currently used to stratify tumors into high- and standard-risk disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F99030\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef99030 \">figure 2</a>). Such stratification can help guide therapy. We recommend at least one, but preferably both, of the following tests be performed to assess risk in newly diagnosed patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F78344\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78344 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognostic-studies-in-multiple-myeloma/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>FISH for detection of t(11;14), t(6;14), t(4;14), t(14;16), t(14;20), del17p13, 1q+, and trisomies of odd numbered chromosomes. FISH for del1p32 can provide additional prognostic information, if available.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conventional cytogenetics (karyotyping) for detection of del 13, monosomy 13, or hypodiploidy</p><p/><p>Patients with t(14;16), t(14;20), or del17p13 by FISH account for approximately 15 percent of multiple myeloma (MM) and are considered to have high-risk MM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognostic-studies-in-multiple-myeloma/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. These patients have a median survival of approximately two to three years despite standard treatment. Studies indicate that the presence of trisomies in patients with high-risk cytogenetics may ameliorate some of the adverse prognostic effect of high-risk cytogenetic abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognostic-studies-in-multiple-myeloma/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Patients with t(4;14) by FISH or deletion <span class=\"nowrap\">13/hypodiploidy</span> by conventional cytogenetics were previously considered to have high-risk disease, but with appropriate therapy (early use of proteasome inhibitor-containing regimens and stem cell transplantation) have an outcome approaching that of standard-risk myeloma. These patients are therefore now considered as having intermediate-risk MM. Patients with 1q+ are also considered to have intermediate-risk MM. All other patients with MM who lack any of the high- or intermediate-risk cytogenetic abnormalities are considered to have standard-risk MM. An expanded genetic testing panel is suggested for patients enrolled in clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognostic-studies-in-multiple-myeloma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Such studies show abnormal karyotypes in only 20 to 30 percent of patients. Typically, cytogenetic abnormalities are characterized by complex karyotypes with frequent numerical and structural aberrations, such as a 13q14 deletion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F64638\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64638 \">figure 4</a>). Cytogenetic abnormalities may be more common (68 percent) and complex in patients with plasma cell leukemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognostic-studies-in-multiple-myeloma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Patients with tumors that demonstrate deletion 13 including monosomy of chromosome 13, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypodiploidy on conventional cytogenetics have a particularly adverse prognosis when treated with regimens that do not incorporate <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bortezomib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bortezomib</a> and transplantation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F78344\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78344 \">table 3</a>). </p><p>As an example, a retrospective analysis of 290 patients with newly diagnosed symptomatic myeloma treated with novel agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thalidomide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lenalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lenalidomide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bortezomib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bortezomib</a>) reported that patients with high-risk cytogenetics (ie, deletion 13, monosomy of chromosome 13, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypodiploidy) had significantly shorter median overall survival (29 versus 69 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognostic-studies-in-multiple-myeloma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Studies that have examined these specific cytogenetic changes in MM include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ploidy &ndash; Hyperdiploidy refers to the gain of numerous chromosomes (trisomies) in the clonal cell population.

Moreover, in clinical trials, response criteria still require 24-hour urine studies for most patients. </p><p>The FLC ratio may also have prognostic value in patients with newly diagnosed symptomatic myeloma when used in conjunction with the International staging system (ISS). As an example, one study evaluated the serum FLC ratio measurement that was available from 790 out of 1027 patients with newly diagnosed myeloma seen at a large referral center [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognostic-studies-in-multiple-myeloma/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. Patients with abnormal FLC ratio (&lt;0.03 or &gt;32) had a significantly shorter median survival when compared with patients with a FLC ratio between 0.03 and 32 (30 versus 39 months, respectively).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H737440\"><span class=\"h2\">Plasma cell labeling index</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The bone marrow plasma cell labeling index (PCLI) is a slide-based measure of the percentage of plasma cells in the S phase of the cell cycle that is available at some centers as a research tool [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognostic-studies-in-multiple-myeloma/abstract/80-82\" class=\"abstract_t\">80-82</a>]. An elevated value (ie, &ge;1 percent) in a patient with apparent MGUS or SMM may suggest early disease progression and the need for careful follow up. A normal value is less helpful in differentiating MM from MGUS, since it is seen in 35 percent of patients with overt MM requiring therapy. An elevated value in patients with apparently stable, plateau phase MM is an adverse parameter that may predict a short time to disease progression and death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognostic-studies-in-multiple-myeloma/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>].</p><p>An increased PCLI (&ge;1 percent) is associated with adverse prognosis in myeloma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognostic-studies-in-multiple-myeloma/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>], and a reduction following treatment may predict improved survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognostic-studies-in-multiple-myeloma/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>].</p><p>Despite the above studies, the use of PCLI is limited by lack of widespread availability.
