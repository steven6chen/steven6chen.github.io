A &quot;fracture&quot; is another word for a broken bone. The elbow is a joint made up of three bones (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F58954\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58954 \">figure 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The humerus &ndash; The humerus is the bone that runs from the shoulder to the elbow.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The radius &ndash; The radius is one of the bones in the forearm, the part of the arm between the elbow and the wrist. It is on the thumb side of the forearm when the palm is facing up.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ulna &ndash; The ulna is the other bone in the forearm. It is on the &quot;pinky side&quot; of the forearm when the palm is facing up.</p><p/><p>In children, most elbow fractures happen:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Above the elbow in the humerus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>At the knob of the elbow at the end of the humerus</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29378061\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes elbow fractures in children?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adults usually get elbow fractures when they fall on an outstretched hand. But children usually get elbow fractures from different types of injuries. In children 3 years old or younger, most elbow fractures happen because of a fall from a bed or couch. In older children, most elbow fractures happen because of a fall off the monkey bars or a playground swing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29378076\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of an elbow fracture?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms include pain, swelling, and tenderness around the elbow. Most children who have a broken elbow are also unable to move the injured elbow. Plus, many children who have broken a bone remember feeling a pop, crack, or snap when the injury happened.</p><p>If you think your child has broken an elbow, see a doctor or nurse right away.</p><p><strong>Call for an ambulance (in the US and Canada, dial 9-1-1)</strong> if your child:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has severe pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has a very crooked looking arm</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has any bones sticking out through the skin</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29378091\"><span class=\"h1\">Will my child need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your child's doctor or nurse will ask about his or her symptoms, do an exam, and take an X-ray. During the exam, the doctor or nurse will look at and feel the injured elbow and check the pulse in the wrist. He or will also ask your child to do some simple finger movements, such as pinching something, spreading the fingers, or giving a &quot;thumbs up.&quot; This can show if the fracture caused any nerve damage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29378106\"><span class=\"h1\">When should I call my child's doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You should call the doctor or nurse if any these symptoms occur after your child's fracture has been treated:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The elbow gets very swollen</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Purple spots appear near the elbow</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain in the forearm gets worse</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain gets worse when the child stretches out his or her fingers</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The hand gets cold and pale</p><p/><p>These symptoms could mean the arm muscles and nerves have been damaged. If this happens, your child will need to have his or her cast taken off (if your child was wearing a cast). The doctor will then follow your child's symptoms and decide whether he or she needs more treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29378121\"><span class=\"h1\">How is elbow fracture treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment depends on the type of fracture a child has and how serious it is.</p><p>If your child breaks an elbow, he or she will likely get medicine to help with pain. This might include ibuprofen (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin) or stronger medicines such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">morphine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">fentanyl</a>. If your child gets morphine or fentanyl, it will need to go into his or her vein through a small tube called an &quot;IV.&quot;</p><p>If the ends of the broken bones are not far apart, the doctor will probably give your child a splint or cast, and a large bandage that hangs from the back of the neck and supports the arm (a &quot;sling&quot;). This will keep the arm from moving while the bone heals.</p><p>If the ends of the broken bones are far apart, the doctor will need to move them back into place. Often, the doctor will need to do surgery to move the bones, but not always. Once the bones are in place, the doctor might use pins, screws, or wires to keep them from moving.</p><p>After your child gets treated by a regular doctor or in the emergency room, he or she will also need to see a doctor who specializes in treating bones, called an orthopedic surgeon. The orthopedic surgeon will decide how long your child should wear a splint or cast. He or she will also take X-rays to make sure the bones are lined up correctly and healing well.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29378136\"><span class=\"h1\">Can elbow fractures be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Make sure your child only plays in playgrounds where there is at least 6 to 12 inches of soft surface (such as mulch, sand, or shredded rubber material) under the equipment. Also, make sure your child wears elbow guards when he or she is doing sports such as skateboarding.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25148341\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cast-and-splint-care-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cast and splint care (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fractures-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Fractures (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cast-and-splint-care-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Cast and splint care (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
