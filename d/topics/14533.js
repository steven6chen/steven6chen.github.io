They include radial head and neck fractures, ulnar olecranon, ulnar coronoid process fractures, and Monteggia fractures. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18956455\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Proximal forearm fractures, also considered a type of elbow fracture, include radial head and neck fractures as well as ulnar olecranon and coronoid process fractures. These are the least common type of forearm fracture in children. However, with the popularity of football and basketball and an increase in extreme sports, there has been an accompanying increase in elbow injuries, including proximal forearm fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-fractures-of-the-forearm-in-children/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Radial head and neck fractures in particular, previously rare in pediatrics, have increased dramatically in teenagers with the increased popularity of extreme skateboarding, ATV riding, and other high-risk sports. </p><p>Proximal radial fractures account for approximately 5 to 8 percent of elbow fractures in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-fractures-of-the-forearm-in-children/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>]. The most common age group is 9 to 12 year olds, and most of these fractures involve the radial neck (metaphysis and physis) rather than the radial head. This is because the radial head is mostly cartilage in this age group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-fractures-of-the-forearm-in-children/abstract/2,4,7-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,7-12</a>].</p><p>Olecranon fractures are uncommon in children, accounting for about 5 percent of elbow fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-fractures-of-the-forearm-in-children/abstract/2,4-6,13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4-6,13-15</a>]. In children, the olecranon is comprised of thicker bone than the distal humerus, and therefore, supracondylar fractures of the humerus are more common than olecranon fractures. </p><p>Coronoid fractures are uncommon pediatric fractures and are usually associated with an elbow dislocation or other elbow fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-fractures-of-the-forearm-in-children/abstract/1,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18956462\"><span class=\"h1\">PERTINENT ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The anatomy of the pediatric forearm determines the types and extent of the common fractures and the healing process. The bones, muscles, ligaments, and tendons all work together in stabilizing the forearm. The motions of the elbow are flexion, extension, pronation and supination. These require maintenance of the stability of the three articulations: radio humeral (radiocapitellar), proximal radioulnar, and ulnohumeral (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F66874\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66874 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-fractures-of-the-forearm-in-children/abstract/1,4,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,13</a>]. </p><p>The anatomy of the radius and ulna are shown in the picture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F64025\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64025 \">figure 2</a>). The radial head is the epiphysis at the proximal end of the radius. The radial head articulates with the capitellum, which is located on the distal lateral humerus. The radial neck is just distal to the radial head, and then the radius expands into the radial tuberosity and the diaphysis. The proximal ulna forms a groove into which the trochlea of the distal humerus rests. The bounds of this recess are the coronoid process on the volar aspect and the olecranon process on the dorsal aspect.</p><p>The elbow does not have bony stability; the radial and ulnar collateral ligaments and capsule are the principle joint stabilizers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F72889\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72889 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-fractures-of-the-forearm-in-children/abstract/1,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,13</a>]. The radial and ulnar collateral ligaments connect the distal humerus to the proximal radius and ulna, and the annular ligament and interosseous membrane maintain the radioulnar joint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-fractures-of-the-forearm-in-children/abstract/1,13,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,13,17</a>]. Because of the complex structure of the elbow, even minor abnormalities can cause significant pain and disability.</p><p>The arteries and nerves coursing through the elbow are at risk when there is an elbow injury. The brachial artery, and median and radial nerves run anterior to the elbow joint and can be stretched or disrupted by proximal forearm fractures, especially with valgus displacement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82540\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82540 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-fractures-of-the-forearm-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The ulnar nerve courses medially through the elbow and can be stretched, torn, or entrapped, especially with posterior injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-fractures-of-the-forearm-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18956476\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSICAL FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>History should include the age of the child, mechanism of the injury, when it occurred, and the position of the hand or forearm during impact, if known [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-fractures-of-the-forearm-in-children/abstract/1,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,13</a>]. In a young child with a swollen or sore elbow, it may be difficult to distinguish between infection and trauma. Even with a nonspecific history of minor trauma, such as &quot;fell down&quot;, the source of pain and swelling may be infectious. A history of a witnessed fall with immediate pain and decreased use of the arm makes trauma the most likely cause. The evaluation of children with osteomyelitis or bacterial arthritis is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematogenous-osteomyelitis-in-children-evaluation-and-diagnosis#H601785676\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hematogenous osteomyelitis in children: Evaluation and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Initial evaluation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bacterial-arthritis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-infants-and-children#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bacterial arthritis: Clinical features and diagnosis in infants and children&quot;, section on 'Evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>After a fall on an outstretched arm, there is often swelling, pain, and deformity with markedly limited range of motion of the hand, wrist, forearm, and elbow. Patients who have sustained major trauma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F57293\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57293 \">table 1</a>) are at risk for multiple traumas and warrant a complete physical examination and appropriate ancillary studies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-initially-stable-child-with-blunt-or-penetrating-injury#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the initially stable child with blunt or penetrating injury&quot;, section on 'Blunt trauma'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trauma-management-approach-to-the-unstable-child#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trauma management: Approach to the unstable child&quot;, section on 'Initial approach'</a>.)</p><p>Once other injuries are excluded, the examination can focus on the forearm and elbow. In a patient with severe pain, analgesia should be initiated to facilitate the child's comfort. Initial pain control in patients with moderate to severe pain can be achieved within 10 minutes with intranasal&nbsp;<a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fentanyl</a>&nbsp;delivered by an atomizer. Once an intravenous line is established, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">morphine</a> can be given as needed.&nbsp;Pain should be controlled prior to radiographic evaluation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacologic-agents-for-pediatric-procedural-sedation-outside-of-the-operating-room#H223310\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacologic agents for pediatric procedural sedation outside of the operating room&quot;, section on 'Fentanyl'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5669604\"><span class=\"h2\">Inspection and palpation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinician should examine the arm from the clavicle down, noting the following: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arm position</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Any obvious deformity, tenderness, or swelling around the elbow</strong> &ndash; The proximal radius and ulna should be palpated. It is important to also examine the entire upper extremity, especially the joint above and below the injured area. For example, bilateral proximal radial fractures with associated scaphoid fractures have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-fractures-of-the-forearm-in-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], and proximal radial fractures are frequently associated with a second elbow injury such as a ligament rupture, a medial epicondyle fracture, or an olecranon or other ulnar fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-fractures-of-the-forearm-in-children/abstract/1,2,5,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,5,10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Skin wounds</strong> &ndash; Careful inspection of the entire forearm is necessary to detect an open fracture. Signs of an open fracture may be subtle because the bone often pokes through the skin and then retracts, leaving only a small puncture. In contrast to an abrasion or puncture from the outside of the arm overlying the fracture site, a small puncture resulting from an open fracture tends to ooze blood. If no active bleeding is noted, the clinician should attempt to express blood through the wound site as circumferential pressure will bring blood to the surface from a small open fracture.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Range of motion of all joints in the affected arm</strong> &ndash; The patient should perform active range of motion of all joints that can safely be moved without exacerbating the injury (eg, supination, pronation, flexion, and extension of the elbow; abduction, adduction, internal and external rotation of the shoulder). The clinician should not perform passive range of motion in patients with suspected fractures. Normal range of motion for the elbow includes flexion to at least 135 degrees (typical normal elbow flexion 150 degrees), extension to 0 degrees, and supination and pronation each to 90 degrees [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-fractures-of-the-forearm-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The clinician should compare mobility with the unaffected elbow in children whose range of motion appears limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-fractures-of-the-forearm-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5669866\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurovascular examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A complete neurovascular evaluation includes an assessment of radial and brachial pulses and the sensory and motor function of the median, radial, and ulnar nerves (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SM%2F53902\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53902 \">table 2</a>). Patients with normal initial neurovascular examinations warrant regular repeated evaluation, especially immediately following fracture manipulation or movement of the affected extremity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5670193\"><span class=\"h3\">Pulse</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinician should compare the radial and brachial pulse with the opposite limb. Initially symmetric and equal pulses with normal perfusion and skin warmth are reassuring but do not entirely exclude vascular injury. However, patients who maintain normal pulses and perfusion over time are unlikely to have brachial artery injuries.</p><p>If a radial or brachial pulse is not palpable, a Doppler ultrasound should be used to determine the presence of distal perfusion. Pulse oximetry may also provide evidence of pulsatile flow as well as degree of oxygenation distal to the injury. If the pulse oximetry provides a wave form and oxygen saturation, then it can be used to provide continuous information on distal extremity perfusion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5670200\"><span class=\"h3\">Perfusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Brisk capillary refill, normal color, and a warm hand indicate the presence of some distal perfusion, even when distal pulses are diminished or absent. Maintenance of perfusion despite abnormal pulses often arises from brachial artery spasm that typically resolves after urgent closed reduction and percutaneous pinning.</p><p>However, diminished or absent pulses in association with poor distal perfusion, pallor, and a cool hand are concerning signs of ischemia, especially in association with pain upon passive extension of the fingers. Patients with these findings warrant emergent intervention to reestablish limb perfusion. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5670241\"><span class=\"h3\">Neurologic function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following tests establish motor function of the major nerves while minimizing extremity movements:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;OK&quot; sign (alternatively, ask the patient to pinch your hand): anterior interosseous nerve (branch of median nerve) and posterior interosseous nerve (branch of radial nerve) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F52203\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52203 \">picture 1</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two fingers spread against resistance (eg, pointer or middle finger) or holding a piece of paper firmly between the middle and ring fingers: ulnar nerve (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F75179\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75179 \">figure 5</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thumbs up sign: radial nerve (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51625\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51625 \">figure 6</a>) </p><p/><p>The clinician should perform testing of two point discrimination in children over five years of age to assess sensory function.

It is more common in children with proximal forearm fractures who also have a supracondylar fracture. Once the clinician suspects an acute compartment syndrome, compartment pressures must be measured to determine whether they are elevated, or a clinical decision to perform a fasciotomy is needed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-compartment-syndrome-of-the-extremities#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute compartment syndrome of the extremities&quot;, section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18956497\"><span class=\"h1\">RADIOGRAPHIC ASSESSMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with suspected proximal forearm fractures should undergo plain radiographs of the elbow and forearm (including anteroposterior [AP] and lateral views of the elbow, forearm, and wrist). All of these views can be obtained on two plain radiographs by an experienced radiology technician. Much of the pediatric elbow is composed of cartilage, and fractures can be very subtle on radiographs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-fractures-of-the-forearm-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The anatomic landmarks as seen in a normal radiograph of the elbow are shown in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F56647\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef56647 \">image 1</a>). The radial head and neck are demonstrated on both AP and lateral views of the elbow. The olecranon process of the ulna is best seen on the lateral view. The radial head often is superimposed over the coronoid process of the ulna on the lateral view. The normal appearance of the radial head and olecranon varies significantly with age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54444\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54444 \">figure 7</a>). Oblique views of the elbow may be needed to evaluate for specific types of proximal forearm fractures (eg, radial neck or coronoid fractures) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F63751\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef63751 \">image 2</a>). </p><p>A disciplined approach to examining pediatric elbow radiographs helps to ensure that important findings are not missed. In addition to noting obvious fractures, this approach includes examining the ossification centers, looking for anterior and posterior fat pads, checking the anterior humeral line, and evaluating the radial-capitellar relationship. The interpretation of elbow radiographs in children is discussed in detail separately.

The elbow typically is flexed to 90 degrees, and the forearm is kept in neutral position with respect to supination and pronation. If swelling is significant, the elbow should be straighter than 90 degrees<sup> </sup>in the splint to permit better venous return and decrease the possibility of the development of an acute compartment syndrome. If the elbow is very swollen, an orthopedist should be consulted at the time of initial evaluation to assess for an associated injury or early compartment syndrome.

A proximal radial fracture, usually through the physis, may also accompany a posterior dislocation of the elbow (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F70331\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef70331 \">image 4</a>). The fracture occurs either with the dislocation, or when the elbow dislocation spontaneously reduces, and the radial head (epiphysis) is displaced either anteriorly or posteriorly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-fractures-of-the-forearm-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5674027\"><span class=\"h3\">Presentation of proximal radial fractures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinician should suspect a proximal radial fracture if there is tenderness over the radial head, and supination and pronation of the forearm produces pain on the lateral side of the elbow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-fractures-of-the-forearm-in-children/abstract/1,2,6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,6,7</a>].</p><p>Plain radiographs most commonly show a Salter Harris II fracture through the physis with a metaphyseal fragment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54582\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54582 \">figure 10</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F78789\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef78789 \">image 5</a>); a radial neck fracture can also be more distal through the metaphysis.

This situation adds confusion to the diagnosis and treatment of radial neck fractures. Whenever possible, angulation should be determined by a person with expertise (eg, pediatric radiologist or orthopedic surgeon). In addition, the curve of the radial shaft should be smooth; a sharp angle indicates a fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-fractures-of-the-forearm-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Approximately half of children with proximal radial fractures will have a second elbow injury such as a ligament rupture, a medial epicondyle fracture, or an olecranon or other ulnar fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/proximal-fractures-of-the-forearm-in-children/abstract/1,2,5,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,5,10</a>].

A subtle radial neck fracture may be present with or without a posterior fat pad sign, as part of the radial neck is extraarticular.
