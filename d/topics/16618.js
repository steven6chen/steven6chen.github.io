Restoration of normal uterine architecture and preservation of fertility are the goals of surgical treatment of uterine anomalies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F76124\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76124 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F81036\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81036 \">figure 1</a>). However, normal or near-normal architecture cannot always be achieved and merely creating a normal uterine cavity may not be therapeutic because uterine vascularization and myometrial and cervical function may also be abnormal.</p><p>Surgical management of congenital uterine anomalies is reviewed here. The evaluation and diagnosis of women with congenital uterine anomalies is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-uterus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of congenital anomalies of the uterus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical repair of congenital uterine anomalies is primarily directed toward women with uterine septa, bicornuate uteri, and obstructed hemi-uteri. Women with unicornuate or arcuate uteri are generally not candidates for reconstructive procedures because surgery does not improve pregnancy outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-congenital-uterine-anomalies/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The most common indications for repair of congenital uterine anomalies are pelvic pain and repetitive pregnancy loss. Prior to surgical intervention, however, other causes of these problems should be excluded. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-couples-with-recurrent-pregnancy-loss\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of couples with recurrent pregnancy loss&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Dysmenorrhea in women with septate uteri may be considered an indication for hysteroscopic metroplasty if medical therapy is not effective. Laparoscopic evaluation for coexistent endometriosis (common in women with structural abnormalities of the reproductive tract) should be undertaken.</p><p>We, and others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-congenital-uterine-anomalies/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>], do not believe abdominal repair of the didelphic uterus to improve pregnancy outcome is sufficiently supported by existing data. Pregnancy outcomes in women with bicornuate uteri have been reported to be close to those of the general population. However, since some of these women have recurrent pregnancy loss, surgical treatment with uterine reunification via laparoscopy or laparotomy may be indicated after other possible causes of recurrent pregnancy loss have been addressed.</p><p>Surgical correction is not warranted in asymptomatic women or those with primary infertility. Uterine abnormalities typically don't prevent conception and implantation. As an example, one series of 228 women with uterine anomalies noted that 9.1 percent had primary infertility, and most of these cases could be explained by other defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-congenital-uterine-anomalies/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Most authorities agree that primary infertility in the presence of uterine anomalies is <strong>not</strong> an indication for metroplasty. However, metroplasty may be considered after a complete diagnostic evaluation has been performed and appropriate therapeutic interventions have failed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">OBSTRUCTED UTERINE RUDIMENTARY HORNS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with m&uuml;llerian aplasia or a unicornuate uterus and cyclic or chronic abdominal or pelvic pain may have a noncommunicating uterine horn with functional endometrium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F69536%7EOBGYN%2F61993\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69536 graphicRef61993 \">figure 2A-B</a>). MRI or ultrasound are useful in identifying the noncommunicating uterine horn and determining whether an endometrial stripe is present.</p><p>Patients with an obstructed uterine horn are at increased risk of endometriosis, but the endometriosis usually resolves after the removal of the obstructed hemiuterus. Excision of the obstructed rudimentary blind horn will prevent endometriosis by eliminating reflux, and will also prevent development of a pregnancy (and pregnancy complications) in the obstructed uterine horn (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F67507%7EOBGYN%2F81269\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67507 graphicRef81269 \">picture 1A-B</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-congenital-uterine-anomalies/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The obstructed rudimentary noncommunicating uterine horn should be removed laparoscopically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-congenital-uterine-anomalies/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">HYSTEROSCOPIC REPAIR OF THE SEPTATE UTERUS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hysteroscopic metroplasty has become the method of choice for repair of most uterine septa. Benefits to the transcervical approach include less morbidity, no abdominal or transmyometrial incisions, and faster return to normal activity. As there is no abdominal incision, possible infections and intra-abdominal adhesions that may cause future infertility problems or pain are avoided. Women may attempt pregnancy sooner after a <span class=\"nowrap\">vaginal/transcervical</span> approach than after abdominal procedures. Vaginal delivery is not contraindicated.</p><p>Various techniques and instruments are used either to incise or remove the septum, including semirigid or rigid scissors (7 French) or unipolar wire loop (8 mm) urologic resectoscope (21 to 26 French sheath); Versapoint bipolar electrode (1.6 mm; 5 mm sheath); or Potassium-titan-phosphate <span class=\"nowrap\">(KTP/532),</span> neodynamic:yttrium aluminum garnet (Nd:YAG), or argon lasers.</p><p>Use of any of the above instruments is associated with good success rates and infrequent complications. Use of microscissors or bipolar electrode may decrease operating time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-congenital-uterine-anomalies/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The procedure can be done with laparoscopic assistance, both to evaluate the external uterus and to observe the myometrium in an attempt to decrease the risk of perforation. Some operators use progestational agents preoperatively to further atrophy the lining, but this is not necessary. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=danazol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Danazol</a> is slightly better than gonadotropin releasing hormone agonists because of lower cost and side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-congenital-uterine-anomalies/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. After evaluation of the pelvic organs with the laparoscope, the uterus is instilled with glycine, dextran or another appropriate medium. If two cervices are noted, a Foley balloon may be inserted into one os to prevent leakage of the distension media (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F64519\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64519 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p>A partial septum may require only incision of the septum. Alternatively, with a partial or a complete septum, the septal tissue can be removed. In deciding which technique to use, the surgeon should remember that the goal is to reduce the septal surface area.</p><p>The broad flat fundus of the septate uterus can be seen in the picture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F65245\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65245 \">picture 2</a>). Surgical resection of a septum using a wire is demonstrated in the following pictures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F79425%7EOBGYN%2F53717%7EOBGYN%2F62456\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79425 graphicRef53717 graphicRef62456 \">picture 3A-C</a>). With the resection technique, the wire is place in one endometrial cavity and moved horizontally to the other side, thereby removing the septal tissue.</p><p>It can be difficult to recognize when the base of the septum has been reached. One approach is to continue cutting until increased bleeding is noted, since the septum often has poor blood supply compared to the myometrium, but this approach will not work if a coagulative instrument is used. Alternatively, if laparoscopy is performed at the same time, the laparoscope can be used to visualize when the hysteroscopic resection is getting too close to the uterine serosal surface, especially if the laparoscopic light is dimmed so that the hysteroscopic light can be appreciated.</p><p>On completion of the procedure, the surgeon should be able to visualize the fundus and sweep easily between ostia. The uterine cavity should appear normal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Postoperative care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No further treatment is required postoperatively. Intrauterine devices, Foley balloons, high-dose estrogen, and antibiotics are not necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-congenital-uterine-anomalies/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Formation of intrauterine synechiae is rare, as are postoperative infections. Endogenous estrogen is sufficient to promote new endometrium within two months of hysteroscopic metroplasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-congenital-uterine-anomalies/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>An HSG should be performed two months after surgery to assess success. Typically, over 90 percent of the septum is removed during the procedure. Occasionally, further repairs of the septum are required, again in an ambulatory setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-congenital-uterine-anomalies/abstract/13,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,15</a>]. In one series, a residual fundal notch greater than 1 cm on follow-up hysteroscopy was considered an indication for repeating the septoplasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-congenital-uterine-anomalies/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Attempts at pregnancy may begin two months postoperatively if the procedure is deemed adequate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6324043\"><span class=\"h2\">Outcome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A meta-analysis of 29 observational studies that evaluated hysteroscopic metroplasty in women who were not treated with in vitro fertilization found a pregnancy rate of 64 percent and a live birth rate of 54 percent after the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-congenital-uterine-anomalies/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">LAPAROSCOPIC/ABDOMINAL TRANSMYOMETRIAL REPAIR OF THE SEPTATE UTERUS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most uterine septums can be successfully surgically addressed hysteroscopically. If however the septum cannot be safely removed hysteroscopically, then an abdominal or laparoscopic approach, such as the Jones or Tompkins metroplasty, can be used.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Jones metroplasty</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Jones procedure refers to a wedge resection of the portion of the uterine fundus containing the septum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F71446%7EOBGYN%2F50489%7EOBGYN%2F66362\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71446 graphicRef50489 graphicRef66362 \">figure 4A-C</a>). The operator draws a triangular incision line forming a wedge in the anterior-posterior plane of the uterus. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Vasopressin</a> can be injected into the myometrium (10 units in 30 mL of saline) to reduce bleeding when the uterus is subsequently incised. Alternatively, a tourniquet, such as a 0.5 Penrose drain, may be placed through an avascular space in the broad ligament just lateral to the uterine vessels and tied at the junction of the lower uterine segment and the cervix. Using the same holes in the broad ligament, tourniquets should also be secured on the infundibulopelvic ligaments bilaterally. It is important that arterial flow is stopped, since uterine congestion and bleeding are increased if only the venous flow is restricted. Sutures should be placed bilaterally for traction, lateral to the area of planned resection. The wedge is then incised until the common uterine cavity is found and the septum can be totally removed.</p><p>Reconstruction of the uterus begins at the lower portion of the cavity. The anterior and then posterior walls are closed in either a continuous or interrupted fashion. Some operators inject <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylene-blue-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylene blue</a> into the uterine cavity prior to the incision, so that the endometrium is easily identified. The first layer should include the endometrium and a small amount of myometrium. The knot should be tied so that it remains in the uterine cavity. The second closure layer is begun inferiorly and performed with interrupted sutures that include the remainder of the myometrium. The final layer, using light suture in a continuous or interrupted fashion, contains the remainder of the myometrium and serosa, attempting to imbricate the rough serosal edges.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Tompkins metroplasty</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Tompkins metroplasty is similar to the Jones procedure, except that no tissue is removed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F67827%7EOBGYN%2F79101%7EOBGYN%2F58593\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67827 graphicRef79101 graphicRef58593 \">figure 5A-C</a>). The uterus is incised in the midline anterior-posterior plane until the uterine cavity is reached. The bilateral cavities are then unroofed, using sharp dissection, and the uterus is closed as in the Jones procedure. The benefit of this technique is that the resultant uterine cavity is larger than with wedge resection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1017588543\"><span class=\"h1\">UTERINE TRANSPLANTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Uterine transplant is a potential option for patients with M&uuml;llerian agenesis and fusion defects (eg, Mayer-Rokitansky-K&uuml;ster-Hauser syndrome [MRKH], congenital absence of the uterus). For women with MRKH, approaches to having a child include adoption, gestational carrier, or uterine transplant. Extensive counseling and discussion should occur due to the risks and benefits of each option. In some parts of the world, gestational carriers are not legal and thus adoption and transplant are the only options. </p><p>If a uterine transplant is a possibility, the decision process includes consideration of the surgical risk to the donor and recipient, immunosuppressive medications for the recipient, and the potential unknown risk to the baby due to in-utero exposure to the antirejection medications. There is extensive clinical experience with the acceptability of immunosuppressive therapy in renal transplant recipients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-care-of-the-adult-kidney-transplant-recipient#H3098269272\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of care of the adult kidney transplant recipient&quot;, section on 'Immunosuppressive medication during pregnancy'</a>.) &#160; &#160; </p><p>The Montreal Criteria for the Ethical Feasibility of Uterine Transplantation was developed to guide clinicians and researchers in ethically carrying out uterine transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-congenital-uterine-anomalies/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. There have been only a few reports of human uterine transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-congenital-uterine-anomalies/abstract/19-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-23</a>]. Donors were deceased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-congenital-uterine-anomalies/abstract/21,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,24</a>], from mothers to daughters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-congenital-uterine-anomalies/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], and from an unrelated friend [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-congenital-uterine-anomalies/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p>The first live birth after uterine transplantation occurred in 2014 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-congenital-uterine-anomalies/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The uterus donor was a 61 year-old unrelated family friend. The transplant recipient, a 35 year-old woman with congenital M&uuml;llerian agenesis, was delivered via cesarean at 32 weeks of gestation because of preeclampsia. The healthy 1775 gram infant was appropriately grown for gestational age. &#160;</p><p>However, in one case, uterine necrosis developed 99 days after the transplant and required hysterectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-congenital-uterine-anomalies/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOME</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Fetal salvage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Improved fetal survival has been demonstrated for all of the above described procedures. The successful pregnancy rate after hysteroscopic metroplasty is 85 to 90 percent, which compares favorably with preoperative fetal salvage rates of 5 to 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-congenital-uterine-anomalies/abstract/26-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-31</a>].</p><p>Several series on abdominal metroplasty reported improvement in fetal survival from 3 to 12 percent preoperatively to 65 to 90 percent postoperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-congenital-uterine-anomalies/abstract/32-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-37</a>]. However, others have questioned whether metroplasty truly improves outcome for women with repetitive abortions. In a study of 146 women with bicornuate, septate, or didelphic uterus, 30 of whom were matched, no increase in the number of living children was found after metroplasty in the matched group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-congenital-uterine-anomalies/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Consecutive pregnancies in an abnormal uterus may carry longer so that eventually some women will deliver nearer to term without surgery. In addition, women with septate uteri may also have subfertility due to other abnormalities, which may not be corrected by surgery. As an example, a review of women with primary infertility and septate uterus reported the mean pregnancy rate after hysteroscopic metroplasty was only 48 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-congenital-uterine-anomalies/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Reduction in pregnancy complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The frequency of malpresentation, retained placenta, and intrauterine growth restriction associated with m&uuml;llerian abnormalities should return to that of the general population after repair. It is unclear whether there is an improvement in preterm birth rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-congenital-uterine-anomalies/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Minimal data are available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-congenital-uterine-anomalies/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Reduction in dysmenorrhea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A prospective study of dysmenorrhea reported by women who underwent Tompkins (n = 28) or hysteroscopic (n = 62) metroplasty for septate uteri found that the frequency of dysmenorrhea fell from 50 to 32 percent after the Tompkins procedure and from 55 to 18 percent after hysteroscopic treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-congenital-uterine-anomalies/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is an increased risk of uterine rupture with procedures requiring fundal hysterotomy. Most authors recommend cesarean delivery for these women. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=choosing-the-route-of-delivery-after-cesarean-birth\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Choosing the route of delivery after cesarean birth&quot;</a>.) Uterine rupture has also been reported rarely after hysteroscopic procedures, but attempted vaginal delivery is generally recommended after these procedures in the absence of other obstetrical indications for cesarean birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-congenital-uterine-anomalies/abstract/43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-45</a>].
