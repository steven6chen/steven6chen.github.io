In a review of 21 studies of pacemaker and implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) recipients with variable follow-up, the rate of infections ranged from 0.8 to 5.7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-involving-cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>The following observations illustrate the range of findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a series of 8303 pacemaker insertions for which antistaphylococcal periprocedure prophylaxis was routinely administered, pacemaker-associated infection occurred in 468 patients (5.6 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-involving-cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Among 33 patients with definite pacemaker lead endocarditis, 16 also had valvular involvement (10 tricuspid and 6 aortic or mitral valves). Twelve other patients had valvular endocarditis without evidence of pacemaker involvement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective cohort study of residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota, between 1975 and 2004, 1524 cardiac device patients were identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-involving-cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Over 7578 device-years of follow-up, the incidence of definite device infection was 1.9 per 1000 device-years.

The number of prior procedures and the lack of antibiotic prophylaxis at the time of implantation and post-procedure hematoma are prominently noted risk factors.</p><p>Among studies that report the time of onset of infection relative to implantation, 63 to 77 percent of infections are noted within one year and 23 to 37 percent after one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-involving-cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Pocket infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Perioperative contamination of the pacemaker pocket with skin flora appears to be the most common source of subcutaneous infection. This was illustrated in a prospective study including 103 patients undergoing elective pacemaker implantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-involving-cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swab specimens, obtained from the pulse generator pocket upon completion of and immediately prior to suturing the pocket, yielded bacteria from 48 and 37 percent of specimens, respectively; the organisms were predominantly coagulase-negative staphylococci.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Five patients (4.8 percent) developed subsequent pacemaker infections. <em>Staphylococcus schleiferi</em> (a coagulase-negative species) caused three of these infections at 4, 16, and 29 months after implantation. Based upon molecular typing, the <em>S. schleiferi</em> isolates recovered at surgery and at the time of the infection appeared identical.</p><p/><p>While the infection rate was markedly lower than the periprocedure contamination rate, this study suggests that perioperative contamination can result in a delayed onset infection.</p><p>Erosion through the skin of a pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) system component (eg, the device itself or the subcutaneous portion of a lead) can be a portal for contamination that leads to infection. Alternatively, such erosions can occur as a secondary phenomenon due to pressure that develops on the overlying skin from a preexisting infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-involving-cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Deeper infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infection of the intravascular component of a pacemaker or ICD system manifesting as an endocarditis-like vegetation occurs primarily on the intracardiac portion of the lead along the right atrium, the tricuspid valve, or the right ventricular contact point. Occasionally, vegetations may be seen on the lead as it traverses from the superior vena cava into the right atrium. These infections may have tracked intravascularly from infection of a subcutaneous pacer component or may have arisen by bacteremic seeding from a remote site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-involving-cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices/abstract/2,16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,16-18</a>].</p><p>The host response to the intravenous lead can provide protection from late bacteremic seeding. Approximately one week after placement, the portion of the lead in contact with the vein intima becomes partially incorporated into the vein wall by connective tissue and an endothelial covering. Fibrous tissue proliferation at some sites in the vena cava and right atrium results in a fibrotic attachment of the pacing lead to these points [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-involving-cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. While these changes make subsequent extraction of pacing leads difficult (see <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'System removal'</a> below), the endothelial covering may protect the lead against the adherence of bacteria and subsequent infection during episodes of bacteremia.</p><p>Epicardial electrodes may be infected at the cardiac attachment point as a result of intraoperative contamination or, less likely, by spread of infection along pacing electrodes from an infected pulse generator pocket.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H176291398\"><span class=\"h2\">Causative organisms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> and coagulase-negative staphylococci (often <em>Staphylococcus epidermidis</em>) cause 65 to 75 percent of generator pocket infections and up to 89 percent of device-related endocarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-involving-cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices/abstract/5,21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,21-23</a>]. Episodes arising within two weeks of implantation are more likely to be due to <em>S. aureus</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-involving-cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Seeding of the device from systemic bacteremia primarily occurs with <em>S. aureus</em> infections. Among staphylococci causing device infection, methicillin resistance should be assumed until tests demonstrate methicillin susceptibility.

Methicillin resistance was common among all of these staphylococci. Polymicrobial infection occurred in 18 patients, and cultures were negative in 7 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F55942\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55942 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>In a series of 44 episodes of device endocarditis between 1991 and 2003, the number of infections due to coagulase-negative staphylococci, <em>S. aureus</em>, fungi, gram-negative bacilli, and <em>C. acnes</em> was 18, 18, 3, 2 and 1, respectively. One case was polymicrobial. Among the three fungal infections, there were two cases of <em>Aspergillus fumigatus</em> and one case of <em>Candida albicans</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-involving-cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

A review of <em>S. aureus</em> bacteremia in patients with implanted pacemakers or implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) yielded several important observations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-involving-cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients with bacteremia within the year following device placement or manipulation, infection of the generator pocket was often confirmed by culture even in the absence of local signs and symptoms of pocket infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among 12 patients with <em>S. aureus</em> bacteremia within the year after device placement, infection of the device occurred in 9 patients. The devices themselves were the source of the bacteremia in 6 cases and were seeded hematogenously in 3 cases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among 21 patients with <em>S. aureus</em> bacteremia one year or more after device placement, hematogenous seeding of the device occurred in 6 cases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among 27 patients with <em>S. aureus</em> bacteremia not arising from the device itself, the device was infected hematogenously in 9 patients and the device status was indeterminant in 9 others. The device was definitively spared in only 9 patients.</p><p/><p>In another study, 62 patients with either an implanted pacemaker or an ICD experienced <em>S. aureus </em>bacteremia; this occurred greater than one year after implantation in 63 percent of cases. Of these patients, 22 (37 percent) had device infection. Bacteremia presenting &lt;3 months after implantation was associated with generator pocket infection. Among patients with bacteremia &gt;1 year after device placement, 30 percent had device infection, almost all of which was device-related endocarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-involving-cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>In another study, 45 (34 percent) of 131 patients with CIED who experienced <em>S. aureus</em> bacteremia and had no signs of pocket infection had CIED infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-involving-cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Thus, patients with implanted cardiac devices who develop <em>S. aureus</em> bacteremia require aggressive treatment and careful evaluation for CIED infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Gram-negative</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gram-negative organisms do not often seed cardiac devices. This was illustrated in a retrospective study of 49 patients with gram-negative bacteremia and either a permanent pacemaker or an ICD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-involving-cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

However, gram-negative bacteremia from sources other than the cardiac device rarely seed the device pocket or leads. Thus, in the absence of evidence of pocket infection or device-related endocarditis, patients with gram-negative bacteremia from a remote site can be treated without initial explantation of the device or leads [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-involving-cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices/abstract/18,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,31</a>]. Recurrence of gram-negative bacteremia with the same species after such treatment and in the absence of an alternative source for bacteremia should prompt careful evaluation for device infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Device infections are generally considered in two categories:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Superficial infection (pocket infection) &ndash; Pocket infection refers to infection involving the subcutaneous pulse generator pocket containing the device and the subcutaneous segment of the leads (ie, not the transvenous segment). In some cases, part of the device or lead erodes through the overlying skin. Such an erosion can occur without overt evidence of infection, but there is inescapable contamination of the site, and these cases are managed as pocket infections. Pocket infections are the most common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-involving-cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices/abstract/7,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,23</a>]. However, infection of the pocket can extend to the intravascular lead.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">During the initial 30 days after implantation, there may be &quot;early postimplantation inflammation,&quot; a non-infection or a superficial infection that does not extend to the CIED pocket.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deep infection &ndash; Deep infection refers to infection involving the transvenous portion of the lead (with involvement of the contiguous endocardium or valve) or epicardial electrode (with involvement of the epicardium). Deep infection is usually with associated bacteremia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> endovascular infection. Deep infection can occur with or without involvement of the generator pocket and can include lead infection, in which there are vegetations on the intracardiac portion of the lead or superior vena cava, or device-related endocarditis, in which there may be vegetations on the intracardiac portion of the lead and the subadjacent endothelium or tricuspid valve.</p><p/><p>Alternatively, device infections may be classified by the mode of infection:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary infection, in which the device <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pocket itself is the source of infection, usually due to contamination at the time of implantation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Secondary infection, in which the leads (and then sometimes the device and the pocket) are seeded due to bacteremia from a different source.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Generator pocket infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infections involving the generator pocket typically develop soon after device implantation or battery exchange. These infections present as acute or subacute wound infections with swelling, erythema, pain, and occasionally drainage through a dehisced incision. These early onset infections may be associated with fever and systemic symptoms and may be accompanied by bacteremia. However, fever and systemic symptoms are often absent when infection is localized to the generator pocket [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-involving-cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>Within 30 days after implantation, <span class=\"nowrap\">erythema/inflammation</span> of the incision site that is not infection may develop. If there is no purulent exudate, dehiscence, fluctuance, or systemic sign of infection, these changes are called &quot;early postimplantation inflammation.&quot; These changes may be due to local bleeding, reaction to a wound dressing, or skin preparation. A stitch abscess is included in this categorization. The changes should resolve within two weeks. Close observation is required to detect changes that in fact indicate pocket infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-involving-cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Pocket infections can also arise many months after implantation due to a chronic, smoldering infection related to contamination at the time of implant. Delayed erosion of the leads <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> device through the skin may result from a chronic infection but may also be related to weight loss, a superficial pocket, or trauma at the site (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F74725\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74725 \">picture 1</a>). These later infections may have minimal local inflammatory changes and may lack systemic symptoms. The sole major finding may be the point of erosion itself. Nevertheless, erosion of the device unequivocally indicates that the device is contaminated and infected.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Deeper infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Deeper infection may involve epicardial or transvenous electrodes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Transvenous electrodes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infection of transvenous electrodes primarily involves the intracardiac lead and is essentially a right-sided endocarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-involving-cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

Percutaneous aspiration of a pocket that is uninflamed but suspected of infection is not recommended because the diagnostic yield is generally low and there is a potential risk of introducing microorganisms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Device-related endocarditis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term device-related endocarditis is applied to infection of one or more pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) leads wherein vegetations are attached to the lead and contiguous endocardium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-involving-cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. If vegetations are attached to the lead only, this is occasionally referred to as lead infection; however, from a clinical perspective, this may be considered the equivalent of endocarditis. These infections primarily involve the intracardiac portion of the lead and essentially represent a right-sided endocarditis. Up to one-half of patients have echocardiographic or intraoperative evidence of a vegetation on a valve itself (usually the tricuspid valve) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-involving-cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices/abstract/3,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,26,27</a>]. The time course and manifestations of device-related endocarditis were discussed in the preceding section. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p>It has been proposed that the Duke criteria for the diagnosis of infective endocarditis can be used with modifications to facilitate the diagnosis of device-related endocarditis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F73023%7EID%2F53004\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73023 graphicRef53004 \">table 2A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-involving-cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

Thus, patients with a CIED who have bacteremia and septic pulmonary emboli or lung abscesses should be considered to have device-related endocarditis.

Those with severe sepsis should have cultures obtained more rapidly so that antibiotics can be initiated more promptly. Generator pocket tissue and lead tips should be cultured when devices are explanted. Unless removed at cardiac surgery or through an incision other than the pocket, lead tip culture results should be interpreted in the context of the overall data. In the absence of positive blood cultures, positive tip cultures when leads are extracted through the pocket may reflect pocket infection or contamination and not lead-related endocarditis. Erroneous assessment of positive cultures can result in unduly long antibiotic therapy and related toxicities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-involving-cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices/abstract/27,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,36</a>]. In one study of patients with a CIED and <em>S. aureus</em> bacteremia without pocket infection, independent predictors of CIED infection were presence of a pacemaker (rather than an ICD), multiple devices revisions, and &ge;4 days of bacteremia. In the absence of these risk features, the risk of CIED infection was 7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-involving-cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6682442\"><span class=\"h3\">Echocardiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Echocardiography, preferably a transesophageal study (TEE), should be performed promptly in all patients with suspected device infection, especially if there is evidence of generator pocket infection and systemic symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F74493\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef74493 \">movie 1</a>). Similarly, all patients with a device in place and <em>S. aureus</em> bacteremia or with multiple positive blood cultures for a single organism should be assessed by echocardiography.</p><p>A transesophageal echocardiogram should be obtained in patients with a nondiagnostic transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE). The superiority of TEE in detection of vegetations has been demonstrated in a number of studies; TEE identified vegetations on the tricuspid valve or device lead in 90 to 96 percent of patients with endocarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-involving-cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices/abstract/16,17,22,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17,22,38</a>] compared with only 22 to 43 percent identified with TTE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-involving-cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices/abstract/2,16,17,22,27,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,16,17,22,27,38</a>]. The sensitivity of TEE, however, is not 100 percent; thus, a negative study does not rule out the diagnosis of device endocarditis. Alternatively, it is important to keep in mind that fibrous material and stranding is not uncommonly seen when TEE is performed on patients with chronic leads, in the absence of endocarditis. The TEE also allows assessment of the lead in the proximal superior vena cava as well as optimal assessment of the left-sided valves. The TTE may, however, be important for defining prognostic features such as ventricular function and dysfunction, pericardial effusion, and pulmonary vascular blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-involving-cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22061995\"><span class=\"h3\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Combined positron emission tomography (PET) with fluorodesoxyglucose marked by fluorine-18 (18F-FDG) and computed tomography (CT) can be useful in detection and localization of infection; it should be reserved for patients with inconclusive findings with standard diagnostic tools (echocardiography, blood cultures).</p><p>PET depends upon uptake of 18F-FDG by inflammatory cells at the site of infection; its utility is uncertain in patients with leukopenia or after prolonged administration of antibiotics. 18F-FDG <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> technology may be useful for distinguishing soft tissue infection (which overlies the generator) from generator pocket infection and can define infection along the subcutaneous course of electronic leads and within the heart [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-involving-cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices/abstract/39-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-42</a>].

Among 415 patients with infection of implanted electronic cardiac devices, of which 67 percent were caused by staphylococci, a multivariate analysis adjusted for high-risk device removal indicated that patients who did not undergo device removal experienced a sevenfold (hazard ratio [HR] 6.97, 95% CI 1.36-35.6) increase in 30-day mortality. Although device removal can be associated with complications and, thus, risk of death, immediate device removal (in contrast with removal after failure of antimicrobial therapy or no removal) was associated with a threefold (HR 0.35, 95% CI 0.16-0.75) reduction in mortality at one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-involving-cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].

In most cases, the risks of recurrent infection outweigh the risks of extraction.

Such patients may be treated with antibiotics for the bacteremia and then observed for relapse. Subsequent unexplained relapse suggests device infection and a need to extract the system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-involving-cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices/abstract/3,29,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,29,36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Superficial cellulitis at the incision site with infection that does not appear to extend into the generator pocket may be treated without device removal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-involving-cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. However, this distinction is often difficult to make, and patients managed with device retention require close observation (see <a href=\"#H22061995\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> above). </p><p/><p>In cases of pocket infection without bacteremia, TEE evidence of lead infection, or endocarditis, retention of an infected device is usually reserved for patients who refuse device removal or in whom device removal poses significant risks (eg, patients with major comorbidities and limited life expectancy, who have longstanding devices, and who require continuous pacemaker support). Aggressive antibiotic therapy should be administered with this approach. The British Society of Antimicrobial Chemotherapy has suggested a six-week course of therapy as would be used for prosthetic valve endocarditis caused by the implicated organism. There is a high risk of relapse with this approach and no way to test for cure. Hence, in patients who might be candidates for device removal in the case of relapse, monitoring closely following completion of antibiotic therapy is suggested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-involving-cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices/abstract/14,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,36</a>]. If there is evidence of persistent or progressive infection or relapse despite appropriate intravenous antibiotic therapy, the system should be removed. Among patients at risk for relapse (or those who have relapsed) in whom device removal is not an option, long-term suppressive antibiotics can be used, but this is a last resort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infections-involving-cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices/abstract/14,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,36</a>].

For those who do require reimplantation of a new device, one must balance the risk of infecting the new device versus the risk of being monitored without the device in place. A temporary device can be placed, but these are also associated with risk of infection. A new device should be placed contralateral to the site of the previously infected device and should not be placed when there is ongoing bacteremia or systemic signs of infection. It is recognized that the new transvenous leads will lie in the right heart in the vicinity of sites of prior lead infection or lead-related endocarditis, and the sterility of these sites cannot be guaranteed even by sterile blood cultures.
