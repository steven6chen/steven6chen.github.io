Evaluation for airway compromise, impaired respiratory mechanics, hemorrhagic shock, and altered level of consciousness should be made on arrival at the emergency department. Such systematic evaluation helps ensure detection of potentially serious injuries. The approach to the injured child is discussed in detail separately (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F64241\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64241 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trauma-management-approach-to-the-unstable-child#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trauma management: Approach to the unstable child&quot;, section on 'Primary survey'</a>.)</p><p>Large lacerations may lead to hemorrhage that can potentially threaten the airway <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cause hypovolemia. The airway should be evaluated and secured if compromised. Cervical spine immobilization must be maintained in patients in whom cervical spine injury has not been excluded. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-airway-management-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic airway management in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pediatric-cervical-spinal-motion-restriction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pediatric cervical spinal motion restriction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spine-injuries-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and acute management of cervical spine injuries in children and adolescents&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypovolemic-shock-in-children-initial-evaluation-and-management#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypovolemic shock in children: Initial evaluation and management&quot;, section on 'Fluid resuscitation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Determination of the mechanism of injury is crucial in the evaluation of children with tongue lacerations and potentially serious occult injury (eg, cervical spine injury). This is particularly important in children with high-impact trauma (eg, motor vehicle accidents, falls from height, direct blows to the face). Because the tongue is highly vascularized, bleeding caused by laceration may distract attention from the more serious injury.</p><p>In addition, information regarding the child's past medical history, including tetanus immunization status, medications, and allergies, should be sought. The time of the patient's last oral intake also should be determined. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-trauma-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of trauma in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preparation-for-pediatric-procedural-sedation-outside-of-the-operating-room#H11047750\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preparation for pediatric procedural sedation outside of the operating room&quot;, section on 'Fasting and aspiration risk'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with tongue lacerations should undergo a thorough physical examination. As mentioned above, the initial clinical assessment should provide rapid identification of respiratory, circulatory, or neurologic compromise.</p><p>After the primary survey, described above, the entire head and neck should be examined for signs of other injury. Because many tongue lacerations result from dental trauma sustained in falls or motor vehicle accidents, the oral cavity, maxilla, and mandible should be carefully examined:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The oral cavity should be evaluated for foreign bodies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The dentition should be carefully evaluated to assess for dental fracture or avulsion of teeth. Avulsed teeth or fragments of teeth may become an aspiration hazard. The outcome for reimplanted avulsed permanent teeth depends in large measure upon how quickly they are reimplanted, so intervention should be accomplished as early as possible. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-dental-injuries-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of dental injuries in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient should be assessed for malocclusion of the teeth or trismus, either of which may indicate mandibular fracture.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The temporomandibular joint should be palpated bilaterally to assess for condylar fracture.</p><p/><p>The evaluation and management of dental trauma and jaw fractures are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-dental-injuries-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of dental injuries in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=jaw-fractures-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Jaw fractures in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>When the physician is confident there are no other injuries, he or she can proceed by examining the tongue laceration to determine whether it warrants repair. If the laceration is severe enough to warrant repair (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Wound assessment'</a> below), the wound should be prepared for closure. All tongue lacerations, whether or not they are closed primarily, should be irrigated and debrided if necessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">WOUND ASSESSMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The decision whether or not to repair the laceration depends upon the extent of the laceration and the risk of compromised function after healing, but evidence suggests that outcomes for most tongue lacerations in young children are not improved by suturing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-repair-of-tongue-lacerations/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].

The ability of the patient to cooperate with the laceration repair plays an essential role in the choice of anesthesia. The options include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-repair-of-tongue-lacerations/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Direct local infiltration</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intravenous sedation (may be necessary for young or uncooperative patients)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inferior alveolar nerve block</p><p/><p>Infiltrative anesthetics and intravenous sedation are discussed in detail separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subcutaneous-infiltration-of-local-anesthetics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subcutaneous infiltration of local anesthetics&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procedural-sedation-in-children-outside-of-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Procedural sedation in children outside of the operating room&quot;</a>). Older children may tolerate an inferior alveolar nerve block if it is explained to them. This block anesthetizes the pulp of all mandibular teeth to the midline, the anterior two-thirds of the tongue, and regions innervated by the mental nerve. In experienced hands, it provides excellent anesthesia for anterior tongue lacerations.</p><p>The inferior alveolar block is a deep injection, with local anesthetic deposited adjacent to the mandibular foramen. The mandibular ramus is grasped between the thumb (intraoral, on the coronoid notch) and index finger (extraoral) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78142\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78142 \">figure 2</a>). The target area for tissue entry is the mucosa lateral to the pterygomandibular raphe, medial to the anterior border of the mandibular ramus and approximately 6 to 10 mm above the occlusal plane of the mandibular teeth. The needle is inserted parallel to the mandibular occlusal plane and is rotated during the injection to approximately 30 degrees in a horizontal plane so that the syringe barrel rests on the anterior teeth. The depth of injection is approximately one-half the anteroposterior dimension of the ramus. Aspiration to rule out intravascular injection should be accomplished before injecting anesthetic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Site preparation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A bite block may be necessary to help prop open the mouth during irrigation and laceration repair. A bite block can be made by securing gauze around a tongue depressor and placing it between the upper and lower teeth. A nurse or suture assistant can also use a 2 x 2-inch gauze pad to grip the protruding tongue and hold in place for suturing. Alternatively, a traction suture can be placed through the anterior portion of the anesthetized tongue to provide better positioning (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F66740\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66740 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Irrigation and debridement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The wound should be examined for fractured teeth or other foreign bodies, which should be removed, if present. To decrease the risk of contamination, the wound should be irrigated with normal saline using a 30-mL syringe and 18-gauge angiocatheter to remove debris and necrotic material. Tissue that is clearly necrotic should be debrided. However, tissue with unknown viability should be debrided cautiously, since overzealous debridement may cause additional bleeding. Lacerations that are more than 24 hours old should be left open to heal by secondary intention. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">WOUND REPAIR</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tongue lacerations should be repaired with absorbable 3-0 or 4-0-suture material (chromic gut or Vicryl). Lacerations that are particularly deep may require a two- or three-layered closure to prevent formation of a hematoma. The deep muscle should be sutured first, followed by the submucosa and mucosa. Full-thickness bites of the mucosal surface and the lingual muscle should be taken to prevent dehiscence. Large tongue lacerations or lacerations involving the lateral border of the tongue should be well approximated and care should be taken not to overlap tissues.</p><p>Sutures should be placed loosely to allow for swelling. Sutures that are placed too tightly are liable to pull through or cause necrosis of the wound edges. Each suture should be tied with at least four square knots to prevent the constant motion of the tongue from untying sutures. Alternatively, hidden sutures can help prevent chewing and loss of sutures. Absorbable sutures placed in the mucosa do not require removal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Tetanus prophylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tetanus prophylaxis may be indicated for dirty wounds, and should be considered in children who have avulsed teeth, deep lacerations, or intrusion injuries (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61087\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61087 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Within the first 48 hours, complications of tongue laceration can include edema, hemorrhage, and aspiration of saliva and blood. Mild lingual edema may be controlled by application of cold (ie, ice chips, Popsicles). A single dose of intravenous steroids (eg, Decadron 0.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span> may be considered in more severe cases if no contraindications are present; hospitalization may be warranted until airway patency is ensured.</p><p>Other complications of tongue laceration include dehiscence and infection. Prevention of dehiscence, discussed above, entails placing sutures loose enough to permit swelling. The use of prophylactic antibiotic therapy to prevent infection in the management of tongue lacerations is controversial. The use of prophylactic antibiotics should be left to the clinician's discretion because there is little conclusive evidence about risk for subsequent infections in patients with repaired tongue lacerations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-repair-of-tongue-lacerations/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Although it is reasonable to assume that all tongue lacerations are contaminated by microorganisms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> foreign bodies, there is little evidence that prophylactic antibiotics affect the rate of infection in mucosal wounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-repair-of-tongue-lacerations/abstract/1,4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,5</a>].</p><p>Prophylactic antibiotic coverage is indicated for patients who have [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-repair-of-tongue-lacerations/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heavily contaminated wounds in which debridement is suboptimal</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delay in debridement for more than 24 hours</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wounds associated with jaw fractures requiring open reduction</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immune-compromised patients</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wounds sustained in human or animal bites (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-initial-management-of-animal-and-human-bites\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and initial management of animal and human bites&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p>The antibiotic should be chosen to provide Gram-positive and anaerobic coverage.
