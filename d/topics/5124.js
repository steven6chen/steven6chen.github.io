The incidence of blindness, for example, is 25 times higher in patients with diabetes than in the general population. Furthermore, diabetic retinopathy (DR) is the most common cause of blindness in middle-aged subjects, accounting for at least 12,000 new cases in the United States each year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-pathogenesis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Visual loss from DR may be secondary to macular edema (retinal thickening and edema involving the macula), hemorrhage from new vessels, retinal detachment, or neovascular glaucoma.</p><p>The pathogenesis of DR is multifactorial but is primarily caused by the metabolic effects of chronic hyperglycemia, which result in vascular changes and subsequent retinal injury and ischemia. More advanced retinal disease, including proliferative vascular changes and neovascularization in the setting of retinal ischemia, may be mediated by other mechanisms such as the action of vasoactive substances released during the inflammatory process.</p><p>The pathogenesis of DR is reviewed here. Issues related to screening and treatment are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetic-retinopathy-screening\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diabetic retinopathy: Screening&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetic-retinopathy-classification-and-clinical-features\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diabetic retinopathy: Classification and clinical features&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetic-retinopathy-prevention-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diabetic retinopathy: Prevention and treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic hyperglycemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic hyperglycemia is thought to be the primary cause of DR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-pathogenesis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Evidence in support for this hypothesis has come from the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT), which found that intensive insulin therapy, achieving a mean glycated hemoglobin (A1C) of 7.9 percent, reduced the incidence of new cases of retinopathy by as much as 76 percent compared with conventional therapy. The reduction was directly related to the degree of glycemic control as estimated from A1C values (mean A1C with conventional therapy was approximately 9.9 percent); progressive retinopathy was uncommon in patients with A1C values below 7 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F82664\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82664 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glycemic control and vascular complications in type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) found similar results in patients with type 2 diabetes; each 1 percent point reduction in A1C was associated with a 37 percent reduction in development of retinopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-pathogenesis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glycemic control and vascular complications in type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>While chronic hyperglycemia is the fundamental prerequisite for DR, much of current research has focused on the hemodynamic, biochemical, and hormonal mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of this disease process in an effort to develop new therapeutic targets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-pathogenesis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Three of the main mechanisms are impaired autoregulation of retinal blood flow, accumulation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorbitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorbitol</a> within retinal cells, and accumulation of advanced glycosylation end products (AGEs) in the extracellular fluid. A more detailed discussion of this can be found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycemic-control-and-vascular-complications-in-type-1-diabetes-mellitus#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glycemic control and vascular complications in type 1 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p>The data supporting these mechanisms primarily refer to the induction of retinal injury. More advanced retinal disease, including proliferative vascular changes and neovascularization in the setting of retinal ischemia, may be mediated by other mechanisms such as the action of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-pathogenesis/abstract/2,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Autoregulation of retinal blood flow</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic hyperglycemia may increase retinal blood flow. Retinal blood flow is constant until the mean arterial pressure is raised approximately 40 percent above baseline. However, this autoregulatory mechanism is impaired in the presence of hyperglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-pathogenesis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The ensuing increase in retinal blood flow causes increased shear stress on the retinal blood vessels, which may be a stimulus for the production of vasoactive substances, vascular leakage, and increased fluid accumulation in the outer layers of the retina, resulting in macular edema.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Sorbitol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glucose that enters cells is metabolized in part to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorbitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorbitol</a> via the enzyme aldose reductase; sorbitol is then metabolized to fructose, a process that is relatively slow (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F81926\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81926 \">figure 2</a>). The role of sorbitol production and accumulation in the pathogenesis of DR is uncertain. The observation that a polymorphism near the transcription site of the aldose reductase gene is associated with the early onset of retinopathy in some patients with type 2 diabetes is compatible with a potential pathogenetic role for this pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-pathogenesis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Consumption of NADPH during <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorbitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorbitol</a> production can lead to oxidative stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-pathogenesis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], and subsequent sorbitol accumulation can result in altered <span class=\"nowrap\">Na/K-ATPase</span> activity, impaired phosphatidylinositol metabolism, increased prostaglandin production, and alterations in the activity of protein kinase C isoforms. Protein kinase C is important in the pathogenesis of retinopathy because it may mediate the activity of VEGF as well as regulate vascular permeability, and it may further cause the accumulation of sorbitol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-pathogenesis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorbitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Sorbitol</a> accumulation within the cells of the lens is more pronounced with chronic hyperglycemia. It leads to a rise in intracellular osmolality (which causes movement of water into the cells and cell swelling) and to a decrease in intracellular myoinositol, both of which can interfere with cell metabolism. Sorbitol accumulation may also be important in the cataract formation induced by hyperglycemia because swelling of lens fiber cells can lead to their rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-pathogenesis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Advanced glycosylation end products</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In chronic hyperglycemia, some of the excess glucose combines with free amino acids or serum or tissue proteins. This nonenzymatic process initially forms reversible early glycosylation products and later irreversible AGEs via an Amadori rearrangement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F80716\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80716 \">figure 3</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-pathogenesis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Serum AGE concentrations are high in diabetic patients, a change that can lead to tissue accumulation of AGEs, which may cross link with collagen, thereby initiating microvascular complications. AGE accumulation has also been implicated in cataract formation.</p><p>In addition, the interaction between AGEs and their receptor (RAGE) generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) and, subsequently, vascular inflammation. ROS have been shown to be elevated in the vitreous fluid of patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), with a correlation between increasing levels of ROS and more advanced PDR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-pathogenesis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. There is also evidence that inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system with an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) in vitro can inhibit AGE-evoked inflammatory reactions in endothelial cells by suppressing ROS generation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-pathogenesis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Retinal microthrombosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The occurrence of retinal microthrombosis has long been suspected in diabetic patients (on the basis of animal models of diabetes), and one postmortem study demonstrated the presence of microthromboses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-pathogenesis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In this study, the retinal vascular network of nine diabetic patients (average duration of diabetes six years) contained more and larger platelet-fibrin thrombi, as compared with eight age-matched, nondiabetic subjects.</p><p>Microthrombosis leads to the occlusion of retinal capillaries and capillary leakage. Increased adhesion of leukocytes to retinal vascular endothelium is one of the earliest changes observed in the retina before the onset of clinically detectable DR and may be involved in increased vascular permeability. A loss of endothelial integrity leads to retinal ischemia, with subsequent release of growth factors such as IGF-1, platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), and VEGF.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Growth factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Growth factors promote the growth of new blood vessels from adjacent vessels in an abortive attempt to revascularize the diseased tissue. Studies in experimental models of retinopathy have shown that neovascularization is mediated in part by the interaction between IGF-1 and VEGF. In one animal model of retinopathy, as an example, an IGF-1 receptor antagonist reduced the degree of retinal revascularization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-pathogenesis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The possible role of IGF-1 is supported by the clinical observations that retinopathy often worsens in the first year after the onset of intensive insulin therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F61305\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61305 \">figure 4</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-pathogenesis/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>], which may increase serum IGF-1 concentrations, and can be reversed by pituitary injury or hypophysectomy, which lowers serum IGF-1 concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-pathogenesis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>VEGF is produced by many retinal cell types in response to hypoxia. In retinas from diabetic patients, the intensity of immunostaining for VEGF is proportional to the severity of the retinopathy, and vitreous fluid VEGF concentrations are increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-pathogenesis/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. VEGF promotes growth of new blood vessels and may increase vascular permeability.</p><p>Erythropoietin has also been identified as a likely factor promoting retinal angiogenesis in DR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-pathogenesis/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. Concentrations of erythropoietin and VEGF were elevated in the vitreous fluid of 73 patients with PDR compared with 71 patients without diabetes (erythropoietin concentration 464.0 versus 36.5 mIU per mL, respectively). Erythropoietin was more strongly correlated with retinopathy than VEGF. Blockade of erythropoietin inhibited endothelial-cell proliferation in vitro and inhibited retinal neovascularization in vivo in a mouse model. Elevated erythropoietin levels have also been identified in patients with diabetic macular edema who did not have retinal ischemia or proliferative retinopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-pathogenesis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Other growth factors may contribute to progression of the retinal disease, including basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) and hepatocyte growth factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-pathogenesis/abstract/20,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,25</a>]. In one study, as an example, the local concentration of bFGF was much higher in patients with active proliferative retinopathy as compared with those in whom the retinopathy had regressed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-pathogenesis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Carbonic anhydrase</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Carbonic anhydrase concentrations were elevated in the vitreous from individuals with PDR compared with diabetics without retinopathy and nondiabetics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-pathogenesis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In addition, intravitreal carbonic anhydrase injections increased retinal vascular permeability with equal potency to VEGF, through a pH-mediated activation of bradykinin, a vasoactive substance. Furthermore, injection of both carbonic anhydrase and VEGF produced additive increases in vascular permeability. Thus, carbonic anhydrase appears to play a major role in retinal vascular permeability in PDR and may be a target for future therapies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Genetic influences affect the severity of retinopathy. In 372 patients in the DCCT (who had 467 first-degree relatives with diabetes), severe retinopathy was three times more frequent among the relatives of the retinopathy-positive patients than the retinopathy-negative patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-pathogenesis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>How genetic factors might affect the development of retinopathy is not well understood. One possibility is polymorphisms in the platelet membrane glycoprotein <span class=\"nowrap\">Ia/IIa</span> (alpha-2, beta-1 integrin) receptor for collagen (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hemostasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hemostasis&quot;</a>). In a case-control study, patients with type 2 diabetes who were homozygous for the Bgl II polymorphism had a significantly increased risk of retinopathy (odds ratio [OR] 3.4) as compared with those lacking this polymorphism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-pathogenesis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Platelets with this polymorphism may interact with glycosylated collagen more easily than those lacking it, leading to more rapid retinal vascular injury.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Ethnic factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Genetic susceptibility to retinopathy is also suggested by the finding in some studies of a greater prevalence of retinopathy among certain ethnic groups. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 105 patients with type 2 diabetes who were followed for four years, retinopathy occurred more often among blacks than whites (50 versus 19 percent); the difference could not be explained by other factors such as A1C values, systolic blood pressure, or gender [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-pathogenesis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the Veterans Affairs Diabetes Trial (VADT), the prevalence of moderate to severe DR was found to be higher for Hispanics and African Americans than for non-Hispanic whites (36, 29, and 22 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-pathogenesis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The differences were not accounted for by other factors (age, duration of diabetes, A1C, blood pressure).</p><p/><p>However, ethnicity did not explain the difference in prevalence of retinopathy in a cross-sectional study of 778 diabetic patients aged 45 to 85 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-pathogenesis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Although there was a higher prevalence of retinopathy, as well as macular edema, in blacks (36.7 and 11.1 percent, respectively) and Hispanics (37.4 and 10.7 percent) compared with whites (24.8 and 2.7 percent), race was not an independent predictor of retinopathy; longer duration of diabetes, higher fasting glucose, greater waist-hip ratio, and use of insulin or oral hypoglycemic medications were independent predictors of diabetic eye disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There have been case reports of macular edema occurring in patients taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rosiglitazone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rosiglitazone</a>, though its incidence is unknown. Patients who are at risk for fluid retention or who have heart or renal insufficiency appear to be at greatest risk. Thiazolidinediones should be discontinued in patients who develop macular edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-pathogenesis/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Relation to nephropathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The association between the development of DR and nephropathy, independent of the degree of hyperglycemia and the duration of diabetes, suggests that common pathogenetic factors may underlie the development of both complications. One study evaluated the correlation between albuminuria and retinopathy in 815 patients with type 2 diabetes (144 Hispanics and 671 whites) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diabetic-retinopathy-pathogenesis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The presence of albuminuria, defined as urinary albumin excretion &gt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/min,</span> was a significant predictor for retinopathy (as detected via stereoscopic retinal fundus photographs) among the Hispanic (OR 11.1) but not the white patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a major cause of morbidity in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes. The development of DR is complex and is the result of many interrelated factors, which cause two basic changes within the retinal vessels, namely: abnormal permeability and vascular occlusion with ischemia and subsequent neovascularization.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic hyperglycemia is thought to be the primary cause of DR. Both the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) and the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS) have found that glycemic control reduces the incidence of new cases of retinopathy.
