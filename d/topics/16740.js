Some studies suggest that HIV infection may modulate the clinical presentation of syphilis (eg, greater organ involvement, atypical and florid skin rashes, more rapid progression to neurosyphilis), as well as the clinical and serologic response to syphilis treatment. Syphilis may also have a negative impact on the HIV viral load. </p><p>This topic will review the epidemiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of syphilis in HIV-infected patients.

From 2005 to 2014, the overall number of reported primary and secondary syphilis cases increased significantly from 8724 to 19,999 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. In 2015, a total of 23,872 primary and secondary syphilis cases were reported, and the national rate increased by 19 percent to 7.5 cases per 100,000 population, which is the highest rate reported since 1994 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>The rise in the rate of reported syphilis cases is primarily attributable to increased cases among men who have sex with men (MSM). The increasing incidence of syphilis among MSM is due in part to rising rates of risky sexual behaviors, such as anonymous sex, unprotected sex (oral and anal), sex with multiple partners, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sex under the influence of drugs, especially methamphetamine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/4-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-10</a>]. </p><p>Syphilis and HIV have similar modes of transmission, and infection with one may enhance the acquisition and transmission of the other. Thus, there is a high rate of HIV coinfection among MSM with syphilis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/11-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-20</a>]. Available data from the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggest that approximately 50 percent of MSM with primary and secondary syphilis are HIV infected, compared with 10 percent of men who have sex with women and 3.9 percent of women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In a study that was conducted among United States military personnel, 5.8 percent of 4239 patients with newly diagnosed HIV infection also had serologic evidence of syphilis infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3094348361\"><span class=\"h2\">Effect of syphilis on HIV</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Genital ulcerative diseases, including primary syphilis, can facilitate both sexual and perinatal HIV transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/12,13,21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13,21-24</a>].

This was illustrated in a randomized trial evaluating the efficacy of HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), in which 2499 HIV-negative MSM and transgender women received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tenofovir-disoproxil-fumarate-and-emtricitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tenofovir disoproxil fumarate-emtricitabine</a> or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Although there was no difference in the syphilis incidence between the study arms, the incidence of HIV was significantly increased in those patients with incident syphilis (8.0 versus 2.8 cases per 100 person-years). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In pregnant women, syphilis may have implications beyond that of congenital syphilis. As an example, maternal syphilis infection was associated with increased risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV in a study performed in 155 pregnant women in Malawi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

Compared with controls, patients with syphilis were more likely to have increases in HIV viral load during the period following a syphilis diagnosis (27.3 versus 16.6 percent), and the viral load increases were of greater magnitude (54,000 versus 11,318 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Syphilis infection was associated with a greater risk of having an increase in viral load, even among men on antiretroviral therapy (ART) with a baseline viral load &lt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span>. CD4 cell counts also decreased transiently to a greater degree (mean decline 28 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL)</span> following the syphilis diagnosis, but subsequently returned to baseline levels. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In a separate study that included 145 HIV-infected patients with a detectable plasma viral load, the highest cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of HIV RNA were seen among those who had concurrent neurosyphilis, followed by those with serologic evidence of syphilis (but not neurosyphilis), and those without syphilis coinfection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The authors of this study suggested that syphilis may amplify intrathecal HIV replication, possibly through immune activation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although any increase in HIV viral load associated with syphilis infection can potentially increase the risk of HIV transmission, the clinical significance of these findings is unclear.

In addition, there are conflicting data regarding the impact of syphilis on HIV viral load, as no association of early syphilis and changes in blood or semen viral load or CD4 count were found in a retrospective study of 63 HIV-infected patients with early syphilis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1455522162\"><span class=\"h2\">Impact of antiretroviral therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several studies suggest that HIV-infected persons taking potent ART may have better outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/32-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-35</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 231 HIV-infected patients with syphilis, use of potent ART before diagnosis reduced the odds of neurosyphilis by 65 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study that evaluated treatment outcomes of 110 patients with clinical or serologic evidence of syphilitic meningitis or syphilitic eye disease, 86 (78 percent) were HIV infected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

In a systematic review of 101 HIV-infected patients with ocular syphilis, approximately 40 percent presented with only visual symptoms, whereas over half had evidence of a rash consistent with secondary syphilis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. Posterior uveitis was significantly more common in individuals with a CD4 count &lt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span>.

In addition, there are no prospective data assessing the risk of neurosyphilis in patients with early syphilis who have an appropriate decline of RPR titers after benzathine penicillin treatment. </p><p>By contrast, other experts (including some UpToDate authors) believe that nearly all HIV-infected patients with syphilis should have an LP regardless of symptoms, especially those with a CD4 cell count &lt;350 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> and an RPR &gt;1:32 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/syphilis-in-the-hiv-infected-patient/abstract/84-86\" class=\"abstract_t\">84-86</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Syphilis can facilitate transmission of HIV. Among men who have sex with men who have syphilis, there is a high rate of HIV coinfection. (See <a href=\"#H402717952\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical manifestations of syphilis in HIV-infected patients are generally the same as in those who are HIV uninfected (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F50435\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50435 \">table 1</a>). However, HIV-infected patients may be more likely to have multiple chancres and to have chancres present at the same time as symptoms of secondary syphilis. In addition, neurosyphilis may be seen more frequently in patients with HIV infection. (See <a href=\"#H1358159491\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of syphilis is often a presumptive one based upon the results of serologic testing. Direct methods (eg, darkfield microscopy, direct fluorescent antibody testing) are not routinely available in clinical settings because they require special equipment, and the results can be difficult to interpret. (See <a href=\"#H2645998750\" class=\"local\">'General approach'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any patient who is diagnosed with syphilis and has clinical signs or symptoms suggesting neurologic, ocular, or otic involvement should be evaluated for neurosyphilis with a lumbar puncture. However, there is controversy as to whether asymptomatic HIV-infected patients with syphilis require cerebrospinal fluid evaluation. (See <a href=\"#H1159733180\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis of neurosyphilis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HIV-infected patients with syphilis should be treated with the same regimens as those recommended for HIV-seronegative patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F50435\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50435 \">table 1</a>). However, the frequency of monitoring after treatment is greater in HIV-infected compared with HIV-uninfected patients, since there is concern that patients with HIV infection are at increased risk of treatment failure. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain patients may be diagnosed with HIV at the same time they are diagnosed with syphilis. Antiretroviral therapy is recommended for all patients with HIV infection, regardless of their CD4 count, and should be initiated as soon as possible. (See <a href=\"#H2482578837\" class=\"local\">'When to initiate antiretroviral therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HIV-infected persons should be tested for syphilis (regardless of symptoms) upon entry to HIV care, on a yearly basis, and more frequently as indicated by ongoing risk behaviors.
