Hemoglobin is a tetramer of two alpha globins and two beta globins. Hemoglobin S (HbS) is an abnormal hemoglobin that results from a point mutation in the beta globin gene that causes the substitution of a valine for glutamic acid as the sixth amino acid of the beta globin chain. The resulting hemoglobin tetramer <span class=\"nowrap\">(alpha2/beta</span> S2) becomes poorly soluble when deoxygenated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-sickle-cell-disorders/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The pathological polymerization of deoxygenated HbS is essential to vaso-occlusive phenomena [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-sickle-cell-disorders/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The polymer assumes the form of an elongated rope-like fiber, which usually aligns with other fibers, resulting in distortion of erythrocytes into the classic crescent or sickle shape and a marked decrease in red cell deformability.</p><p>HbS polymerization is a primary determinant of the severity of sickle cell disease (SCD). Polymerization is affected by the presence or absence of other Hb mutations co-occurring with HbS, as well as the concentration of fetal Hb within the red cell. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sickle-hemoglobin-polymer-structure-and-functional-properties\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sickle hemoglobin polymer: Structure and functional properties&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, polymerization alone does not account for the pathophysiology of SCD. Subsequent changes in red cell membrane structure and function, disordered cell volume control, and increased adherence to vascular endothelium also play an important role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-sickle-cell-disorders/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Hemolysis generates reactive oxygen species and free plasma hemoglobin (Hb). This free plasma Hb is a powerful scavenger of nitric oxide, whose deficiency plays an important role in the vascular pathology of SCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-sickle-cell-disorders/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

The other beta globin mutation could be the sickle mutation or a different mutation in the beta globin gene (eg, one associated with beta thalassemia or hemoglobin C disease, or others). Patients with a sickle cell disease exhibit a clinical phenotype, anemia, and laboratory evidence of sickling.

DNA-based testing is used for prenatal diagnosis. The diagnostic methods used after birth are those that separate hemoglobin species according to amino acid composition (hemoglobin electrophoresis or thin layer isoelectric focusing), solubility testing, and examination of the peripheral blood smear. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fetal-blood-sampling\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fetal blood sampling&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Characterization of adult hemoglobins in the fetal and newborn periods can be difficult because of the predominance of hemoglobin F (HbF), which confounds detection of hemoglobin S (HbS) by solubility testing.</p><p>Clinical manifestations of SCD are not present at birth, and usually begin to become apparent after the first few months of life as the concentration of HbS rises and HbF declines. Sickled cells can be seen in the peripheral blood of children with SCD at three months of age, and moderately severe hemolytic anemia is apparent by four months of age.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PRENATAL TESTING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The sickle hemoglobin (Hb) diseases (ie, sickle cell anemia, HbSC disease, sickle cell-beta thalassemia) are chronic, debilitating, and sometimes fatal. The severe clinical nature of these diseases, particularly sickle cell anemia and sickle cell-beta<sup>0</sup> thalassemia, and the absence of curative therapy are the primary stimulants for the development of fetal sampling and DNA-based diagnostic methodology. Couples at risk should be offered hemoglobinopathy testing early in pregnancy and the opportunity for prenatal diagnosis where appropriate.</p><p>Currently, fetal DNA samples are obtained by chorionic villus sampling at 8 to 10 weeks gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-sickle-cell-disorders/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Preimplantation diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-sickle-cell-disorders/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>] and testing fetal cells isolated from the maternal circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-sickle-cell-disorders/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>] are not yet in routine use. Although these latter strategies are costly with limited availability, reproductive centers in the United States and Europe are developing protocols for preimplantation diagnosis of sickle cell disorders that utilize very small amounts of DNA from single cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-sickle-cell-disorders/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>The many social and ethical issues that must be faced by the patient and physician in making decisions about prenatal testing for the hemoglobinopathies and the sampling methods that may be used are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-screening-and-testing-for-hemoglobinopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prenatal screening and testing for hemoglobinopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Development of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for amplifying DNA sequences of interest in vitro allowed testing of minute quantities of DNA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-sickle-cell-disorders/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. It also motivated the development of several new methods for detecting the sickle cell gene, such as restriction analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-sickle-cell-disorders/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>], allele-specific hybridization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-sickle-cell-disorders/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], reverse dot blotting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-sickle-cell-disorders/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], and allele-specific fluorescence PCR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-sickle-cell-disorders/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. PCR-based diagnosis for HbSC disease can be made using specific molecular methods for detecting the HbC gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-sickle-cell-disorders/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>], while the diagnosis of sickle cell-beta thalassemia can be made using reverse dot blot methodology to screen the many African-American beta thalassemia mutations, as well as the HbS and HbC mutations, in a single hybridization reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-sickle-cell-disorders/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>].

The Hispanic population is also at risk for SCD. At least 1 in 180 Hispanic births have sickle cell trait. In California, 12.5 percent of <span class=\"nowrap\">HbS/beta</span> thalassemia births occurred in the Hispanic population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-sickle-cell-disorders/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p>These frequencies predict the occurrence of 4000 to 5000 pregnancies per year at risk for SCD in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-sickle-cell-disorders/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Although there have been advances in the diagnosis and management of SCD in high-income countries, much remains to be learned about the optimum implementation of NBS programs and medical management of patients in low-income countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-sickle-cell-disorders/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. For example, a strategy that utilized a team of specially trained midwives at two large maternity services in Cotonou, Republic of Benin, resulted in almost 80 percent of women informed of the risk for SCD agreeing to testing of their offspring. Eighty-five percent of offspring testing positive enrolled in a sickle cell program, and more than 80 percent of these infants were still followed by the program at five years. The mortality rate for this cohort of children under five years of age with SCD was 10 times lower than the general rate recorded in the Republic of Benin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-sickle-cell-disorders/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Types of screening programs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Historically, two programs have been used for newborn screening (NBS): selective screening of infants of high-risk parents, and universal testing of newborns. Universal testing seems preferable due to its economy and superiority of detection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-sickle-cell-disorders/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]; this approach has been endorsed by a consensus panel convened by the National Institutes of Health [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-sickle-cell-disorders/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Although a cost-effectiveness analysis found that targeted screening of African-American newborns for SCD is cost-effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-sickle-cell-disorders/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>], universal screening identifies more infants with disease and prevents more deaths. The advantages of this approach can be illustrated by two observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Targeted screening missed 20 percent of African-American newborns with SCD born in the state of Georgia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-sickle-cell-disorders/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The number of SCD diagnoses doubled when screening was changed from targeted to universal in the state of Connecticut [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-sickle-cell-disorders/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p/><p>As of 2008, screening for SCD in newborns is mandated in all 50 states of the United States and the District of Columbia, regardless of birth setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-sickle-cell-disorders/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. In fact, the importance of NBS programs is being increasingly recognized worldwide. Due to changes in immigrant migration patterns, several European and African countries are initiating NBS programs. These programs face logistical and economic challenges for comprehensive implementation and patient outreach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-sickle-cell-disorders/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>In the United States, any high-risk infant should have documentation of newborn screen results by one to two months of age so that confirmatory testing, if necessary, can be performed, and parental education, penicillin prophylaxis, and referral for comprehensive care can be implemented [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-sickle-cell-disorders/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H19063478\" class=\"local\">'Approach to a positive result from newborn/infant screening'</a> below.)</p><p>The methods for implementation of NBS programs vary somewhat from state to state. In Texas, as an example, &quot;heel stick&quot; filter paper screen is performed within 72 hours of life, with a second screen required at one to two weeks. Testing is by isoelectric focusing, and abnormal specimens are confirmed by repeat testing or by DNA analysis. Tandem mass spectrometry <span class=\"nowrap\">(MS/MS)</span> is an alternative method for newborn screening as it is able to detect hemoglobin (Hb) peptides following digestion of bloodspots with trypsin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-sickle-cell-disorders/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Hemoglobin patterns'</a> below.)</p><p>Abnormal results are reported to the NBS program, data are maintained on a computer registry, and case management services are initiated to ensure medical follow-up. In a review of newborn screen outcomes from 1992 to 1998, 2,292,698 live births were recorded in Texas and 94 percent had specimens collected. The overall prevalence of SCD by ethnic group per 10,000 live births was: 29.91 African American, 0.11 White, 0.29 Hispanic, and 2.47 <span class=\"nowrap\">other/unknown</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-sickle-cell-disorders/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Despite these measures, other states have reported gaps in compliance with early medical intervention, parental education, and provision of comprehensive health services [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-sickle-cell-disorders/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>In California, a two-tier approach to universal NBS is used. First, NBS is performed on dried blood spots utilizing high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Abnormal hemoglobin findings are then referred to the Hemoglobin Reference Laboratory (HRL), where additional testing, including DNA sequencing, may then be performed for final confirmation. With this approach, of approximately 530,000 annual NBS, approximately 2118 samples were referred for HRL over an eight-year period. Hemoglobin (Hb) genotypes included: sickle hemoglobinopathies (32 percent), alpha thalassemia conditions (24 percent), beta thalassemia conditions (4 percent), and other Hb variants, including traits (41 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-sickle-cell-disorders/abstract/29,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,46</a>].</p><p>Despite high percentages of NBS completions by states and high rates of follow-up testing where abnormal findings were detected, there are ongoing problems with timely follow-up and implementation of comprehensive care. One study suggests that there is a wide variation in stakeholder notification (physician, PCP, hospital, families, hematologists), which can lead to alteration in early intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-sickle-cell-disorders/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].

With many laboratory techniques, HbA2 levels are influenced by closely migrating hemoglobin variants such as HbE. Of importance, using HPLC and electrophoresis modalities, HbA2 is overestimated in the presence of HbS, while severe iron deficiency reduces the HbA2 level; this is a particular problem in pregnant women who may be thalassemia carriers. When HbS is not present, microcolumn chromatography or HPLC accurately quantifies HbA2.

The red cells are normochromic unless there is coexistent thalassemia or iron deficiency. If the age-adjusted MCV is not elevated, the possibility of sickle cell-beta thalassemia, coincident alpha thalassemia, or iron deficiency should be considered.

The amount of HbF is a function of the number of reticulocytes that contain HbF, the extent of selective survival of HbF-containing reticulocytes to become mature HbF-containing erythrocytes, and the amount of HbF per red cell. Each variable is separately regulated and the expression of each shows interpatient variability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-sickle-cell-disorders/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].
