White blood cells fight infections in the body. They are made in the bone marrow, which is the tissue in the center of your bones.</p><p>When people have MGUS, their bone marrow makes too many of 1 type of white blood cell. These white blood cells make a protein called monoclonal protein (M-protein).</p><p>MGUS causes no symptoms and, in most cases, does not lead to any problems. But in some cases, MGUS can turn into a serious condition. One serious condition is multiple myeloma, which is a cancer of the white blood cells involved in MGUS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H92701426\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of MGUS?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MGUS does not cause any symptoms. Your doctor or nurse will suspect you have it after you have lab tests done for another reason.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H92701441\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for MGUS?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If your doctor or nurse suspects you have MGUS from other lab test results, he or she will do an exam and further tests. These can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urine tests</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A bone marrow biopsy &ndash; For this test, a doctor takes a very small sample of the bone marrow. Then another doctor looks at the sample under a microscope to see which cells are present.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Imaging tests, such as X-rays, CT scans, PET scans, or MRI scans &ndash; Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the body. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H92701456\"><span class=\"h1\">How is MGUS treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MGUS does not need treatment. But your doctor will monitor your condition closely. That way, he or she will know if your MGUS turns into a serious condition that does need treatment.</p><p>To monitor your condition, your doctor will talk with you and do exams on a regular basis. He or she might also order repeat blood and urine tests. How often these tests are done depends on your individual situation.</p><p>People with MGUS have a higher-than-normal chance of breaking a bone. Because of this, your doctor will check you for osteoporosis, a disease that makes your bones weak. If you have osteoporosis, he or she will treat it. If you don't have osteoporosis, your doctor will recommend things you can do to help keep your bones strong. This includes getting enough calcium and vitamin D.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H92701471\"><span class=\"h1\">What symptoms should I watch for?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You should watch for symptoms that could mean your MGUS has changed into a serious condition. This change can happen quickly. Let your doctor or nurse know right away if you have any of the following symptoms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bone pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling more tired or weak than usual</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Night sweats that soak your clothes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache or dizziness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight loss</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Numbness, tingling, or weakness in the chest, lower back, or legs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blurry vision or trouble hearing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding more than usual</p><p/><p>These symptoms can also be caused by other conditions that are not serious. But your doctor or nurse will want to check that your MGUS hasn't changed into a condition that needs treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H92701486\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=multiple-myeloma-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Multiple myeloma (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoporosis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Osteoporosis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-density-testing-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Bone density testing (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-screening-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cancer screening (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-and-vitamin-d-for-bone-health-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Calcium and vitamin D for bone health (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=multiple-myeloma-symptoms-diagnosis-and-staging-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Multiple myeloma symptoms, diagnosis, and staging (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=multiple-myeloma-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Multiple myeloma treatment (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoporosis-prevention-and-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Osteoporosis prevention and treatment (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-and-vitamin-d-for-bone-health-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Calcium and vitamin D for bone health (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
