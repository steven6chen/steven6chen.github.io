Children returned to their families after an event of maltreatment have an 11 to nearly 50 percent chance of a second event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-diagnostic-evaluation-and-management/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>]. The majority of both initial and recurrent events are neglect. In a study of children seen in an emergency department (ED) for accidents, but retrospectively determined to be physical abuse, 13 percent of patients suffered another physical abuse event in the subsequent five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-diagnostic-evaluation-and-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Despite the urgency of identifying suspected child abuse and the existence of mandatory reporting laws throughout the United States and in many countries around the world, child maltreatment remains consistently under identified and under reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-diagnostic-evaluation-and-management/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Multiple factors contribute to this problem, including the knowledge and expertise of health care practitioners as well as variation in interpretation of what constitutes reasonable suspicion for reporting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-diagnostic-evaluation-and-management/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2461149\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When evaluating the child who is suspected of being physically abused, it is important to remember that findings that appear to indicate abuse may result from other causes. Familiarity with the medical conditions and cultural practices that mimic child abuse and careful medical, laboratory, and radiologic evaluation can facilitate arrival at the correct diagnosis, initiation of appropriate therapy, and avoidance of the consequences of an unfounded report of suspected child abuse. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-child-abuse-recognition\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical child abuse: Recognition&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differential-diagnosis-of-suspected-child-physical-abuse#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differential diagnosis of suspected child physical abuse&quot;, section on 'Cultural practices'</a>.)</p><p>It is rarely possible (and almost never necessary) to definitively conclude that physical abuse has occurred in the first few hours of an evaluation. In the early stages of an evaluation for abuse, physicians should use non-accusatory language that emphasizes the need for further evaluation. Examples include: &quot;Sometimes, when we see injuries like this, there are other injuries that can put a child at risk, and we need to test for them.&quot; Or &quot;This is more injury than we would normally expect from the event you are describing. We should be careful to determine whether there is something else medical going on, or if someone might be hurting your child.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MEDICAL EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The medical evaluation of suspected child abuse begins with obtaining a complete history, performing a physical examination, and observing the interactions between the parents and the child.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once an injury is identified, the history should identify an explanatory trauma or an explicit denial of trauma. A detailed history of trauma events should include preceding activity elevation and motion, events leading to the trauma event, mechanics of the injurious circumstances, and subsequent actions and symptoms of the patient. This sort of detail is necessary for evaluating the plausibility of the reported history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-diagnostic-evaluation-and-management/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p>The need to obtain a history from the child themselves should be tempered by the problem of repeated questioning in young children. Repeated questioning can be perceived by children as implying that their first answer was incorrect and may lead to a skewed or changing history. Children will also attempt to answer questions that they do not understand, resulting in incorrect information. For these reasons, many clinicians have been discouraged from taking a history directly from a child and many forego this step in evaluation. A well-prepared physician, taking a medically oriented history, is likely to obtain information not obtained in forensically oriented interviews, particularly in older children. In so doing, they may also create inconsistencies with forensic interviews, particularly in younger children. Because a child&rsquo;s initial statements have critical importance to the medical evaluation, and because some children are never questioned by any investigator, clinicians should consider talking to children with well-developed linguistic capacity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-diagnostic-evaluation-and-management/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p>Regardless of who obtains the history, the process should begin with open-ended questions about how the injuries were sustained and then proceed to more specific questions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-diagnostic-evaluation-and-management/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The questions should be directed first to the child if he or she is able to speak. The author usually interviews the parents and child together initially; if a significant suspicion of abuse is raised, permission is sought from the parents to interview the child alone. Most parents agree to this; whether or not it is permitted is documented in the medical record. Refusal to permit the child to be interviewed alone is considered a &quot;red flag&quot; for abuse. Social services personnel are helpful in this situation, both in assessing family dynamics and in facilitating the removal of the parents from the examination room (to interview them separately).</p><p>Extensive research on interviewing children stresses the importance of using open ended questions that do not introduce concepts of abusive acts, or an abuser [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-diagnostic-evaluation-and-management/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Requests for unstructured narrative are best, &quot;Tell me about your boo-boo&quot; followed by &quot;WH&quot; questions. For example, following a child's statement that &quot;he hurt me&quot;:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;You said 'he' hurt you, <strong>who</strong> is 'he'&quot;? </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;<strong>What</strong> did he do?&quot;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;<strong>Where</strong> did he do it?&quot;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;<strong>When</strong> did this happen?&quot; </p><p/><p>Interviews should consider a child's age and developmental ability. While children as young as three years old can often supply answers to &quot;who&quot; and &quot;what&quot; questions, &quot;where&quot; and especially &quot;when&quot; comprehension comes later. If a young child has difficulty answering &quot;when&quot; questions, other details can suggest timing. For example, a child who cannot tell you that the abuse occurred two weeks ago may be able to report that the abuse occurred when they visited a neighbor's house, or when Christmas decorations were still up, or when a particular show was on television. </p><p>Clinicians should <strong>avoid</strong> asking the child to select from lists or answer yes-no questions because these approaches are inaccurate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-diagnostic-evaluation-and-management/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p>Historical factors that raise the suspicion of abuse include (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F109401\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109401 \">table 1</a>) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-child-abuse-recognition#H706482175\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical child abuse: Recognition&quot;, section on 'Red flag history'</a>): </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The history provided by the parent or caretaker is inconsistent with the injuries of the child (eg, a child with a history of falling from a sofa onto a carpeted floor who presents with multiple fractures, liver laceration, or traumatic brain injury). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The history is vague or lacking in detail.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The history changes in repeated versions given by the same caretaker to different health care workers, or conflicting histories are given by different family members (eg, infant was burned while bathing in the <span class=\"nowrap\">sink/infant</span> was burned while bathing in the bathtub; mother was bathing <span class=\"nowrap\">her/sister</span> was bathing her).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Injury that is attributed to actions of young siblings; this account may be a cover story or may be true and related to sibling rivalry, inadequate supervision, or violence in the home.

In cases where fractures are the only cause for concern for abuse, it is reasonable to consult with an expert in bone metabolism, such as an endocrinologist or geneticist <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> to consider screening with calcium, ionized calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, parathyroid hormone, 25-hydroxy vitamin D, and osteogenesis imperfecta genotype or phenotype testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-diagnostic-evaluation-and-management/abstract/27,40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,40,41</a>]. If there are concerns for copper deficiency or Menkes disease, measuring levels of copper or ceruloplasmin may be warranted. However, mandated reporting of suspicion for child abuse should not be delayed while awaiting consultation or results of metabolic testing in infants and children with fractures that have high specificity for abuse (eg, rib fracture, metaphyseal corner fractures).

If the child has suffered impact to the head, contact injuries, including skull fractures, scalp hematomas, and cerebral contusions may be identified. Although head CT has the highest sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing acute hemorrhage, some studies have demonstrated that the initial head CTs of abused infants may appear normal, only showing pathology on follow-up scans. Nonetheless, emergent head CTs permit identification of any injury requiring emergent surgical attention. In addition, certain findings are more consistent with intentional head trauma and review by an experienced pediatric neuroradiologist may be helpful to diagnosis this condition.

Diffusion-weighted imaging may detect cerebral ischemia not readily perceived on conventional CT and MRI. Even when injuries are identified with both CT and MRI, the enhanced visual clarity of the latter often makes for a better scan. However, many critically ill infants may not be able to undergo MRI. In addition, because MRI sometimes fails to identify acute subarachnoid or subdural hemorrhage, it is traditionally obtained three to seven days after injury, rather than at the time of admission. MRI is the preferred modality for identifying subacute and chronic injury, because it has the highest sensitivity and specificity.

These studies may demonstrate intraperitoneal fluid, extraluminal air, ileus, and scoliosis, but such findings are present in fewer than 40 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-diagnostic-evaluation-and-management/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. Plain radiographs are followed by CT scan if the patient is stable and internal injury is suspected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-diagnostic-evaluation-and-management/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p>CT of the abdomen with intravenous contrast is more sensitive than are plain radiographs in detecting signs of injury to the liver, spleen, intestines, kidneys, or major blood vessels. CT is considered the first-line evaluation for significant injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-diagnostic-evaluation-and-management/abstract/50,70-72\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,70-72</a>]. Intravenous contrast is used routinely to define injuries to the vasculature, liver, spleen, pancreas, adrenal glands, and kidneys. Simultaneous bone windows can detect associated injuries to the ribs, spine, or pelvis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-diagnostic-evaluation-and-management/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-children#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of blunt abdominal trauma in children&quot;, section on 'Radiologic evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>The practice of using abdominal ultrasound with or without serial measurements of liver enzymes in place of CT is not recommended. In one group of 55 children with abdominal injuries who had both ultrasound and CT, the ultrasound was normal in 7 (13 percent) children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-diagnostic-evaluation-and-management/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Liver enzymes almost universally improve, whether or not an injury is present. In one cohort of 118 children with known hepatic injury and multiple measurements of liver enzymes, 112 (95 percent) had immediate and permanent improvement of their liver enzymes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-diagnostic-evaluation-and-management/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. While these approaches may decrease the amount of radiation exposure to the child, they are insensitive and less likely to identify inflicted injury. The injuries detected are unlikely to be clinically significant, yet are important as red flags for future abuse. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4437991\"><span class=\"h1\">OPHTHALMOLOGIC EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Consultation with an ophthalmologist for a complete dilated indirect funduscopic examination is recommended in all children younger than five years of age in whom abusive head trauma is strongly suspected. The examination should take place within 24 to 72 hours so that transient retinal changes are not missed. The detection of retinal hemorrhages may be a crucial step in the identification of child abuse and appropriately direct additional evaluation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=child-abuse-eye-findings-in-children-with-abusive-head-trauma-aht#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Child abuse: Eye findings in children with abusive head trauma (AHT)&quot;, section on 'Ophthalmology consultation'</a>.)</p><p>Retinal findings, such as retinal hemorrhages, may be detected by any physician who is familiar with such hemorrhages and has experience with direct funduscopy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61192\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61192 \">figure 1</a>).

When the index case is severe or results in death, child maltreatment among other children in the household has been reported in up to 72 percent of siblings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-diagnostic-evaluation-and-management/abstract/78,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">78,79</a>]. In many settings, the ultimate responsibility for this task of identifying and evaluating household contacts falls to the governmental authority responsible for child abuse investigation in collaboration with a child abuse team. However, these children sometimes are brought to the emergency department by social services or have accompanied the abused child. </p><p>Children over the age of two years should undergo a complete history and careful physical examination looking for clinical findings suggesting abuse. A limited number of these patients may need additional studies (eg, plain radiographs) to assess acute injuries. </p><p>In addition to history and physical examination, we suggest that children two years of age or younger who are household contacts of an abused child receive a skeletal survey to screen for abusive fractures. In a prospective, multicenter observational study of 479 household contacts of abused children undergoing evaluation by child abuse teams, at least one abusive fracture was found in 12 percent of the 134 contacts who were two years of age or younger including 34 percent of contacts younger than one year of age, and 56 percent of twins.

None of the fractures detected by screening were clinically suspected or had associated physical findings. Twin siblings were at a clinically significant increased risk of fracture (OR 20). In a separate observational study of 19 sibling sets (18 twins and one set of triplets), physical abuse or neglect of one twin or triplet was associated with similar maltreatment in 53 percent of the remaining siblings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physical-child-abuse-diagnostic-evaluation-and-management/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>].
