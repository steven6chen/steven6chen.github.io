These are acquired via pregnancy, transfusion, or prior transplant.</p><p/><p><strong>or</strong></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ABO blood group incompatibility (ABOI).</p><p/><p>If not adequately removed, the presence of such antibodies is likely to result in severe antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) and early graft loss. AMR or &quot;humoral&quot; rejection was recognized early in the history of transplantation as hyperacute rejection caused by the presence of preformed antibodies (&quot;humors&quot;) to donor blood group ABO or HLA. Introduction of pretransplant crossmatch techniques and the use of ABO-compatible donors essentially eliminated hyperacute rejection.</p><p>With a waitlist time of several years and a disproportionately longer time for patients with blood group B or O, the time spent on dialysis waiting for the appropriate deceased-donor allograft (DDA) to whom such antibodies do not exist in the potential allograft recipient can have a significant adverse effect on both quality and quantity of life. Preemptive transplantation (performed prior to the need for dialysis) provides improved patient and allograft survival as compared with results in patients maintained on dialysis for an extended period of time prior to transplantation.</p><p>Approximately 16 percent of patients currently on the DDA waiting list are highly presensitized to HLA (defined as &ge;80 percent panel reactive antibody [PRA]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-abo-sensitization-and-desensitization-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. As a result, such patients are less likely to be transplanted or will spend an extended period of time on the waiting list, pending availability of a suitable donor kidney. Many of these patients have potential living donors that are excluded without further work-up based upon an initial positive crossmatch with the potential recipient, indicating the presence of preformed HLA antibodies. Similarly, based upon the distribution of blood groups in the United States, approximately one-third of potential living donors are eliminated from consideration based on ABOI.</p><p>Patients with a willing but HLA- or ABO-incompatible donor may wait for a deceased-donor organ or receive a living-donor organ through desensitization, kidney paired donation (KPD), or a combination of both. The choice between desensitization or KPD for an individual recipient depends upon the likelihood of finding a suitable match through KPD and the chances of successful desensitization.</p><p>The increased risk of hyperacute AMR and subsequent allograft loss when transplanting against either preformed HLA antibodies or ABOI has engendered a general avoidance of this practice. However, reports of successful transplantation across HLA <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ABO barriers using various desensitization protocols designed to reduce the amount of preexisting antibody to a level that allows for successful engraftment has stimulated increased interest in using immunologically incompatible grafts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-abo-sensitization-and-desensitization-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>A general overview of crossmatching and the techniques utilized to treat patients to overcome sensitization barriers are presented in this topic review.

However, an extreme lack of available deceased-donor kidneys encouraged investigation into desensitization for <span class=\"nowrap\">ABOI/living-donor</span> allografts (LDAs) in Japan. Data from Japan demonstrating successful long-term results combined with subsequent successful short-term results from ABOI desensitization protocols in the United States and elsewhere have renewed interest in this procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-abo-sensitization-and-desensitization-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/3-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">ABO blood groups and antigens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ABO blood group consists of four common categories (A, B, AB, and O), with types A and O most frequently found in the US population. Antigen is expressed on red blood cells, lymphocytes, and platelets, as well as epithelial and endothelial cells. Formation of blood group antibodies occurs against those antigens not native to the host. Thus, antibodies to both A and B are found in an individual with blood type O, while an individual with blood type AB has no antibodies to A or B antigens. Given the distribution of blood group antigens in the US, the waiting time on the DDA list is markedly prolonged for patients with blood group B or O [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-abo-sensitization-and-desensitization-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>In addition, blood group O individuals tend to have higher isoagglutinin antibody titers to both the A and B antigen as compared with the formation of anti-B by blood group A individuals or anti-A by blood group B individuals. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-antigens-and-antibodies#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell antigens and antibodies&quot;, section on 'ABO blood group system'</a>.)</p><p>Blood type O recipients have a higher incidence of antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) following ABOI transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-abo-sensitization-and-desensitization-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The <strong>initial titer</strong> of the anti-A or B isoagglutinin antibody, rather than the antigen targeted (A1, A2, or B), was initially reported to correlate with the risk of AMR in such cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-abo-sensitization-and-desensitization-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/6,12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,12-15</a>]. It is not clear whether the titer is as significant in the current era of immunosuppression. Most recently, the incidence of acute AMR after is 10 to 30 percent after ABOI.</p><p>Blood group A consists of two subtypes, A1 and A2. Approximately 80 percent of individuals in the US with blood group A express A1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-abo-sensitization-and-desensitization-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The antigenic expression of A2 is quantitatively and qualitatively less than that of A1, and the overall immunogenic risk based on antigen expression alone is A1&gt;B&gt;A2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-abo-sensitization-and-desensitization-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Given the lower immunogenic risk of the A2 antigen, donor A2 kidneys can generally be successfully transplanted into recipients with low pretransplant anti-A titers without the use of desensitization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-abo-sensitization-and-desensitization-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/12,13,17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13,17-19</a>]. Given the longer waiting times of blood type B and O candidates, the allocation of A2 kidneys to select blood group B and O candidates has been studied, demonstrating significantly reduced wait times to transplant with no significant increase in graft loss or death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-abo-sensitization-and-desensitization-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. The Organ Procurement and Transplant Network (OPTN) kidney allocation system implemented in 2014 permits allocation of A2 and A2B kidneys to blood group B candidates meeting center-specific criteria including prespecified low anti-A titers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-abo-sensitization-and-desensitization-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Desensitization protocols for <span class=\"nowrap\">ABOI/LDA</span> have been used since 1989 in Japan.

In this analysis, statistically superior allograft survival in the most recent period was reported at one year (94 versus 78 percent) and five years (90 versus 73 percent); acute rejection rates had also markedly improved (15 versus 48 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The long-term outcomes of 60 consecutive ABOI kidney transplantations after the use of a protocol that incorporated antigen-specific immunoadsorption, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, and intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) were compared with that of 276 ABO-compatible live-donor transplant recipients in three centers in Sweden [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-abo-sensitization-and-desensitization-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. At follow-up of up to 61 months, allograft survival was 97 percent for the ABOI group versus 95 percent for the ABO-compatible recipients. Patient survival was identical for both (98 percent). At this time, isoagglutinin immunoadsorption filters are not approved for use in the United States; however, the outstanding initial results from this study are very encouraging and of extreme interest given the antigen specificity of this procedure.</p><p/><p>Compared with non-ABOI recipients, recipients of ABOI-incompatible kidneys may be at higher risk for infectious complications including pneumonia, urinary tract infections and <span class=\"nowrap\">/or</span> pyelonephritis, wound infection, and BK nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-abo-sensitization-and-desensitization-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>]; additionally higher rates of perioperative bleeding have been observed, likely due to the loss of clotting factors due to the pheresis procedure.</p><p>Outcomes of transplantation across both ABOI and HLA barriers are inferior to those of ABOI transplantation, with increased incidence of early and late acute cellular rejection and AMR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-abo-sensitization-and-desensitization-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Is splenectomy necessary?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although controversial, splenectomy has been commonly used in desensitization protocols for ABOI transplantation to reduce the risk of AMR. This is particularly true in Japan, where the majority of the experience and long-term data are available. Early reports describing hyperacute irreversible vascular rejection in recipients of an ABOI allograft not undergoing pretransplant splenectomy, as compared with favorable outcomes in recipients that had been splenectomized, promoted this practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-abo-sensitization-and-desensitization-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]; in the United States, however, the combination of an additional surgical risk and an increased risk of serious infection, especially in the setting of chronic immunosuppressive therapy, has served to curtail enthusiasm for ABOI transplantation.</p><p>The routine use of pretransplant splenectomy in ABOI transplantation has been called into question. One report described that the suppression of ABO antibodies after splenectomy is not significantly different than in ABOI recipients who are not splenectomized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-abo-sensitization-and-desensitization-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p>ABOI desensitization protocols with attention to pretransplant antibody titers using standard pre- and posttransplant antibody reduction with either plasmapheresis or immunoadsorption and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> (to perform a partial pharmacologic splenectomy) may allow for the avoidance of a surgical splenectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-abo-sensitization-and-desensitization-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/7,8,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8,34</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Rituximab</a> is a humanized mouse monoclonal antibody that targets CD20, which is expressed on the majority of B cells. Rituximab has been reported to allow successful ABOI transplantation when added to a standard protocol in patients otherwise resistant to other desensitization procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-abo-sensitization-and-desensitization-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Despite an absence of detectable splenic B cells after rituximab administration, plasma cells remain as the majority of plasma cells lack CD20 receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-abo-sensitization-and-desensitization-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. While the intact plasma cells are able to produce isoagglutinin antibodies, the deletion of plasma cell precursors may decrease the risk of AMR if used in conjunction with other antibody-depleting measures.</p><p>The specific dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> required in this setting is unclear.

The number of plasmapheresis sessions and IVIG administrations was based on the isoagglutinin titer, and transplantation was not performed until the titer was &le;1:16. The highest pretransplant isoagglutinin titers present were in three patients with titers of 1:128.

Although unable to ascertain with certainty given the small sample size in this analysis, positive C3d staining in ABOI allografts may correlate with antibody-mediated graft injury. Whether the early presence of PTC C4d in these protocols impacts on long-term graft function remains to be determined.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Isoagglutinin antibody titers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It was initially reported that higher baseline isoagglutinin antibody titers predispose to an increased risk of AMR. It is unclear whether a significantly elevated baseline antibody titer predisposes to a poor long-term outcome, given initial successes through desensitization. Furthermore, although elevated isoagglutinin titers are generally observed during acute AMR, the positive predictive value of elevated posttransplant titers is poor, with high titers seen in otherwise stable ABOI recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-abo-sensitization-and-desensitization-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>There is a marked difference in the reporting of antibody titers among institutions. The classic tube dilution method is most commonly used to report an immunoglobulin M (IgM) isoagglutinin titer <strong>and</strong> a total isoagglutinin titer. These have commonly been reported in the literature as an IgM and immunoglobulin G (IgG) titer, but actually represent IgM and total titer. In addition, given observer variation, the reported result should be considered an approximation. Thus, a titer reported at 1:128 may represent a titer of 1:64 to 1:256.</p><p>Improved assays, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)-based technology, should assist in helping to define and standardize acceptable IgM and IgG isoagglutinin titers at baseline and in the peritransplant period. Although center-specific protocols vary, the total isoagglutinin antibody titer is generally reduced to at least 1:32 (and often to &le;1:8) before proceeding to transplantation as higher titers are associated with acute AMR posttransplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-abo-sensitization-and-desensitization-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Most centers also use immunoadsorption or plasmapheresis to maintain an isoagglutinin titer &le;1:16 during the critical two-week period following ABOI transplantation. If fresh frozen plasma (FFP) replacement is required as a result of plasmapheresis treatment, donor blood type or AB donor FFP should be given in order to avoid the administration of anti-allograft isoagglutinin antibodies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Summary</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At present, it is unclear which strategy, plasmapheresis, immunoadsorption, IVIG infusion, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antithymocyte-globulin-rabbit-derived-thymoglobulin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rabbit antithymocyte globulin</a>, anti-interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor antibody, splenectomy, anti-CD20, or a combination of therapies is more effective or cost effective than any of the others described in this section. Only a limited number of institutions have published their results, which are principally short term. While a variety of protocols seem to be effective in allowing successful transplantation across the blood group barrier, much work remains to determine optimal protocols, acceptable baseline, and peritransplant antibody titers and to define the mechanisms responsible for this perceived process of accommodation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">HLA SENSITIZATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Types and importance of anti-HLA antibodies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) who are broadly sensitized to HLA via previously administered blood products, pregnancy, or prior transplantation often possess antibodies directed against deceased-donor and potential living-donor kidneys. Assays that define sensitization detect antibodies against the broad spectrum of potential donors. By comparison, the crossmatch identifies antibodies against a specific donor.</p><p>Depending upon the assay used to detect sensitization or perform a crossmatch, different types of antibodies can be identified. The clinical relevance of the antibodies detected may vary and, in some cases, is uncertain.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunoglobulin G (IgG) versus immunoglobulin M (IgM) &ndash; IgG antibodies detected by sensitization or crossmatch assays are generally considered to reflect true sensitization against HLA, while IgM antibodies are not considered typical of a true anti-HLA response.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>T cell versus B cell &ndash; Antibodies detected against T cells have been generally considered to represent true anti-HLA sensitization against class-I antigens. By comparison, T cell-negative, B cell-positive crossmatch results have been considered to represent HLA class-II antibodies of less significance clinically. However, the realization that B cells also express HLA class-I antigen at a level quantitatively greater than on T cells meant that low titers of preexistent HLA class-I antibody, rather than only HLA class-II antibody, could produce this result. Thus, T <span class=\"nowrap\">cell-negative/B</span> cell-positive reactions may be secondary to either class-I or class-II antibodies, while a T <span class=\"nowrap\">cell-positive/B</span> cell-negative reaction most likely results from a non-HLA antibody as class-I antigen is expressed on both T and B cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complement fixing versus noncomplement fixing &ndash; Antibodies that must fix complement to produce a positive assay are considered cytotoxic and likely to be of clinical importance. Antibodies detected by means that are independent of complement fixation, such as flow cytometric assays or single-antigen bead assays, such as Luminex assays, may detect other antibodies that may not be cytotoxic and for which the clinical significance is unclear. While data do suggest that a positive-flow crossmatch is associated with an increased risk of rejection and decreased graft survival, the positive predictive value of this assay is likely dependent upon whether or not donor-specific antibodies (DSAs) are present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-abo-sensitization-and-desensitization-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>] and, if so, whether the antibody is able to fix complement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-abo-sensitization-and-desensitization-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p/><p>Most assays detect the presence of antibody, but not the precise HLA specificity. Assays to identify the specific HLA targeted, such as single-antigen bead assays like the Luminex assay, require additional time to perform and can only be undertaken in settings such as living-donor allograft (LDA), when time constraints are not an issue.</p><p>Transplantation should <strong>not</strong> proceed if there is persistent evidence of a positive crossmatch secondary to a cytotoxic IgG anti-HLA antibody after a desensitization protocol has been performed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Determination of sensitization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several different assays are available to help determine how sensitized a potential transplant recipient is to HLA. Depending upon the institutional preference, at least one of these tests is performed at the time of the initial transplant evaluation. Patient sensitization is classically reported as the percent panel reactive antibody (PRA) and is an estimate of the likelihood of a positive crossmatch to a pool of potential donors.</p><p>The PRA is reported as historical (the highest value recorded on previous testing) and as current PRA. When using cytotoxicity assays, the percent PRA may vary from one testing date to another in an individual patient, secondary to either a change in antibody levels in the potential recipient, or a change in the composition of HLA in the assay utilized. Enzyme-linked immunoadsorption assays (ELISAs) and flow <span class=\"nowrap\">cytometry/flow</span> bead technology can also be used to estimate PRA using a fixed composition of HLA.</p><p>In 2012, data from the United States reported that 16 percent of patients on the kidney waiting list had a PRA of 20 to 79 percent, and 16 percent were highly sensitized (as defined by a PRA &ge;80 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-abo-sensitization-and-desensitization-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p>The different assays that can be used to determine the PRA include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) assay estimates PRA by adding potential recipient serum to microtiter plates that contain a pool of lymphocytes with defined HLA. Rabbit complement is added, and the plates are viewed after addition of a vital stain. The PRA can then be determined based upon the number of cytotoxic reactions that are observed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ELISA assay uses microtest trays containing known HLA, to which potential recipient serum is added. This test is more rapid than the CDC assay, and the HLA used for screening can be adjusted as necessary to reflect the presumed potential donor pool.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The PRA can also be estimated using flow cytometry, using defined HLA &quot;flow beads&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-abo-sensitization-and-desensitization-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Flow cytometry measures the fluorescence after patient serum has been added to a defined set of HLA flow beads, and a positive test is determined by the mean channel shift in intensity. Highly sensitized patients are not included in a match run if the donor possesses antigens against which the recipient has preformed antibody, thereby increasing the probability of a negative final crossmatch. Multiplexed particle-based flow cytometric (Luminex) and ELISA-based assays are increasingly used to detect the presence of HLA antibodies and DSAs and facilitate a &quot;virtual crossmatch,&quot; which are now entered into the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database at the time of listing for transplantation.</p><p/><p>Algorithms employing such a &quot;virtual crossmatch&quot; can improve efficiency by decreasing the risk of a subsequent positive final crossmatch. The use of very sensitive assays to determine the presence of HLA antibodies may also improve outcomes by avoiding transplantation against the defined antigens should the final crossmatch be negative. However, this is likely to be a patient- and antigen-specific event. Antibodies detectable only by flow beads or other sensitive assays prior to transplantation may not always denote poor graft outcome and could result in an unnecessary bias against some potential recipients. The degree of ischemic injury and subsequent increased antigen expression may also impact the risk of acute and chronic antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) in this setting. At present, the long-term effects on graft function and the risk of acute or chronic AMR in the setting of a &quot;positive virtual crossmatch only&quot; transplant are unknown and require clarification.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Crossmatch</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When a potential donor is identified, a crossmatch is performed prior to transplantation to evaluate for any evidence of preformed antibodies with specificity for the potential donor that could lead to hyperacute or acute AMR. The available crossmatch assays differ in the degree of sensitivity.</p><p>Transplant centers may adopt a conservative crossmatch policy wherein <strong>all</strong> testing is done using a very sensitive assay, such as flow cytometry. This may help to significantly reduce the chance of posttransplant hyperacute or acute rejection.</p><p>However, as noted above, this approach may also be too sensitive in that clinically irrelevant, non-HLA antibodies are detected and potentially viable transplant opportunities are bypassed. Thus, many centers use an approach that matches the crossmatch assay to the clinical concern, given the potential for sensitization in the potential recipient. With this strategy, flow cytometry is used only in specific cases. This remains a controversial area.</p><p>The pretransplant crossmatch may be performed using three different sets of sera from the same potential recipient against the donor lymphocytes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum from the potential recipient at the time of the highest historical PRA</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum from the potential recipient that was most recently stored</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum that is obtained when the patient is called in for a potential transplant (final crossmatch)</p><p/><p>The final crossmatch (from fresh serum) is done in <strong>all</strong> cases and must be negative to proceed with transplantation. The scenario of current sera negative, historical sera positive may indicate the presence of preformed antibodies that have waned in titer, but also the presence of a memory cell line that could rapidly expand and produce rejection, if rechallenged with donor antigen. Although this is not an absolute contraindication to proceeding with transplantation, it should be evaluated in the clinical context of presumed patient risk and with close posttransplant monitoring. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Summary'</a> above.)</p><p>The following is an overview of the different types of crossmatch tests and the significance of their results.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC or standard NIH-CDC)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The CDC or standard National Institutes of Health (NIH)-CDC is similar to the CDC test used to define PRA. It is performed using wells containing donor cells, rather than a pool of lymphocytes. Potential recipient serum is added, along with rabbit complement, and cytotoxicity is determined after administration of a vital dye. The test is done in dilutions to rule out prozone effect and to help estimate the magnitude of the immunologic reaction.</p><p>Modifications of this test include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A wash step to help eliminate clinically irrelevant antibodies (Amos-modified CDC)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The addition of antihuman globulin (AHG-modified CDC) to increase the sensitivity by inducing crosslinking of any antibody present and, thus, increasing the likelihood of visualizing cytotoxicity.</p><p/><p>If the crossmatch is positive by CDC, the process is repeated with the addition of dithiothreitol (DTT). This step <strong>reduces</strong> the disulfide bonds present when the antibody is IgM. A test that is CDC <span class=\"nowrap\">positive/DTT</span> negative (presence of an IgM antibody only) should <strong>not</strong> preclude transplantation. By comparison, the presence of a <span class=\"nowrap\">CDC-positive/DTT-positive</span> test is an indication of IgG anti-donor antibody and is a <strong>contraindication</strong> to transplantation without the use of a desensitization procedure, especially if a DSA has been defined. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Summary'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Flow cytometry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Flow cytometry can be used as a crossmatch test and is routinely performed in some institutions, but only selectively in others. As an acute screening test for deceased-donor allografts (DDAs), it can define a positive T- or B-cell reaction and whether the antibody present is an IgG or an IgM; however, this may potentially result from non-HLA antibody. In the setting of LDA, when acute results are not necessary, flow beads or other sensitive single-antigen antibody detection methods can be used to determine if an IgG HLA antibody is responsible for the registered shift in fluorescent intensity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ELISA test can be used posttransplant to rapidly determine the presence of DSAs. However, it cannot be used as a pretransplant crossmatch test.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Other assays</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of highly sensitive screening techniques, particularly the <strong>single-antigen bead</strong> assay, have been introduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-abo-sensitization-and-desensitization-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/52-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-54</a>]. With this technique, microspheres coated with single HLA antigens are incubated with patient sera, resulting in the detection of both complement- and noncomplement-activating antibodies.</p><p>These assays are helpful in determining the etiology of a positive crossmatch test, but, as above, the clinical relevance in the setting of a negative crossmatch is unclear. The presumed strength of an antibody compared with a control and prior antigen exposure history should be considered prior to transplantation in the setting of detectable DSA, but negative cytotoxicity crossmatch. If performed, close monitoring should ensue posttransplant, given a presumed increased risk of AMR. As with transplantation after HLA desensitization, long-term results of this practice are unknown.</p><p>Sensitive single-antigen assays are also useful for listed patients with persistently positive crossmatch results against deceased donors. Evidence for a lack of DSA on recent recipient screening tests can allow transplantation to proceed when positive crossmatch results occur as a result of autoantibodies or other non-HLA antibodies (negative virtual crossmatch).</p><p>The advent of these assays has been extremely useful and, as above, has been incorporated into the UNOS organ allocation schema, but work remains to determine the significance of positive DSA results in an individual setting and the expected outcome in a desensitization protocol. Further endeavors will include comparing in vitro results with in vivo events as not every antibody detected is necessarily expressed or accessible in vivo and may be irrelevant. Likewise, complement activation is not required for a positive test result, and the significance of noncomplement-activating antibodies in vivo is unclear.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">What we test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We routinely perform an NIH-CDC T- and B-cell AHG crossmatch on all allograft recipients. In addition, we perform a T- and B-cell flow crossmatch on potential recipients with a second transplant (who are presumed to be highly sensitized) or with a history of a positive PRA, as detected by either ELISA or standard CDC assays. A flow crossmatch is also performed in the setting of any high-risk case for presensitization (child-to-mother or husband-to-wife donation).</p><p>We currently use single-antigen bead assays (Luminex) to test for HLA antibodies in potential DDA recipients and to assess DSAs in potential LDA recipients. Any potential LDA recipient with evidence of DSAs undergoes a flow crossmatch in addition to the cytotoxicity crossmatch. All of this information is used to help define the presumed risk of AMR and plan for desensitization, if appropriate, or to recommend against transplantation with a particular donor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Summary and risk assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Regardless of the test used, highly sensitized patients are often crossmatch positive to multiple potential donors and require a zero-antigen-mismatch allograft to increase success. These patients are therefore relegated to the deceased-donor waiting list and have a very low rate of eventual transplantation. For this reason, desensitization against preformed HLA antibodies is being used for both DDA and LDA recipients.</p><p>The following is a summary of the contraindications for transplantation and a proposal for risk assessment for acute AMR based on crossmatch results, as determined by the Profiling Work Group for AMR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-abo-sensitization-and-desensitization-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A current positive CDC or AHG-CDC is associated with a high risk for AMR.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A current positive CDC is a contraindication to transplantation, unless DSAs can be reduced with desensitization protocols.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A current positive flow crossmatch or a remote (historic) positive CDC or AHG-CDC crossmatch is associated with an intermediate risk for AMR. In this setting, augmented immunosuppression may be required.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A low risk is noted in patients with negative current and remote flow or AHG-CDC crossmatch. Such patients can undergo conventional immunosuppressive therapy.</p><p/><p>Current and remote negative crossmatches, if obtained only by CDC, are not necessarily associated with a low risk for AMR, given the highly variable sensitivity of the CDC technique.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h1\">DESENSITIZATION PROTOCOLS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the survival of HLA-mismatched kidneys is reduced compared with HLA-matched kidneys, the survival of recipients of HLA-mismatched kidneys is higher compared with highly sensitized transplant candidates who remain on the waiting list and are undergoing dialysis. This was suggested by a multicenter study that compared survival of 1025 recipients of HLA-incompatible living-donor kidneys with matched, waitlisted controls who either never received a kidney or who eventually received an HLA-compatible deceased-donor kidney [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-abo-sensitization-and-desensitization-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].

Protocols typically involve monthly infusions of IVIG at 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> (maximum 140 g).

The 15 potential DDA recipients all had exhibited a positive crossmatch to multiple potential donors and had been on dialysis for more than five years. The 28 potential LDA recipients all had a positive crossmatch with their respective donor. The two potential cardiac transplant recipients were also highly HLA sensitized.</p><p>The potential LDA recipients underwent an initial in vitro cytotoxicity test to evaluate the inhibition or reduction of DSA.

In this multicenter study, 101 patients with PRAs &ge;50 percent were randomly assigned to IVIG (2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> monthly for four months) or placebo.

Administering the necessary volume of an iso-osmolar IVIG solution while the patient is on dialysis allows for simultaneous correction of volume issues. When administering high-dose IVIG to a patient not receiving simultaneous hemodialysis, individual product guidelines for rate of administration should be followed to decrease the risk of complications related to a high osmotic load.

Immunoadsorption is not yet routinely available in the United States.</p><p>Thus, advantages of the low-dose IVIG protocol include its documented use in patients with high-titer anti-HLA antibodies with desensitization and successful transplantation in patients with DSA titers of up to 1:256 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-abo-sensitization-and-desensitization-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. Although patients with high-titer DSA may respond to this protocol, numerous pretransplant sessions may be required to obtain an adequately low titer that will allow successful transplantation across the HLA barrier, as well as numerous posttransplant sessions to limit the rise of DSA titers and prevent AMR. As with the ABOI protocol, the number of pretransplant plasmapheresis sessions required can usually be estimated based on the initial antibody titer.</p><p>When using low-dose IVIG, the more sensitive AHG crossmatch can be used prior to transplantation, which may help detect the presence of preformed antibodies missed using the NIH cytotoxicity assay. After transplantation, it is possible to follow crossmatch and DSA by several assays, rather than only by the least sensitive NIH cytotoxicity assay.</p><p>Interference of these tests by adjunct agents, such as antithymocyte globulin or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, requires special steps to remove the administered antibody from the assay to avoid false positives. Accidental removal of anti-HLA antibody when attempting to remove antithymocyte globulin or rituximab from the crossmatch assay could therefore result in a false negative. Disadvantages include the high financial cost and resource requirements to perform this desensitization protocol. As the timing of the actual transplant procedure must be adjusted to allow for an acceptable antibody titer, this protocol is only suitable for potential sensitized recipients of a LDA.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h3\">Comparative studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Only one study has directly compared high-dose IVIG with <span class=\"nowrap\">plasmapheresis/low-dose</span> IVIG protocols.

In this report from the Mayo Clinic, the following three protocols were employed sequentially in renal transplant recipients with high DSA levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-abo-sensitization-and-desensitization-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plasmapheresis, plus low-dose IVIG, plus anti-CD20 antibody (32 patients), referred to as the plasmapheresis group. 19 of the 32 patients in this group also underwent splenectomy; posttransplant plasmapheresis and low-dose IVIG were continued on postsurgery days 1 to 3 for a total of two to three sessions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High single-dose IVIG (13 patients), which is the high-dose IVIG group.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plasmapheresis, plus low-dose IVIG, plus anti-CD20 antibody, plus pretransplant antithymocyte globulin, combined with posttransplant DSA monitoring (16 patients), which is the <span class=\"nowrap\">plasmapheresis/monitoring</span> group.

Patients with low baseline antibody titers (&le;1:4) were successfully desensitized by any of the three methods. By comparison, only 2 of 10 patients with a baseline titer &ge;1:8 were successfully desensitized with the high single-dose protocol versus 12 of 19 in the <span class=\"nowrap\">plasmapheresis/low-dose</span> IVIG groups. Three of the eight patients not responding to the high-dose IVIG regimen did respond when switched to the <span class=\"nowrap\">plasmapheresis/low-dose</span> IVIG protocol. Only 1 of 10 patients with a baseline titer &ge;1:32 responded to any of the three methods. Significantly lower humoral rejection rates were also reported with the plasmapheresis protocols (37, 29, and 80 percent, respectively), although none of the patients in the high single-dose IVIG group received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> or posttransplant administration of IVIG.</p><p>Another possible explanation for the lower likelihood of a negative crossmatch result with the high-dose IVIG protocol in this analysis as compared with previous high-dose IVIG desensitization reports may have been the use of the AHG cytotoxicity assay. The increased sensitivity of the AHG-CDC assay as compared with the standard CDC assay, used in previous high-dose IVIG reports, may have produced a greater number of persistent positive crossmatch results.</p><p>Additional limitations with this study include nonrandomization and low numbers of patients. While this report suggests that plasmapheresis-based desensitization protocols may provide superior desensitization outcomes and lower rates of acute AMR as compared with a high single-dose IVIG regimen, the avoidance of pretransplant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> and absence of posttransplant administration of IVIG in the single-dose group may have biased the results.</p><p>Patients with low baseline antibody titers responding to high-dose IVIG may do equally as well with further optimization of therapy.

Routine posttransplant plasmapheresis and IVIG administration for one to three sessions, as described in this study, in the absence of graft dysfunction or evidence of rejection, is of uncertain benefit.</p><p>Given the high risk of acute rejection, however, most clinicians would favor this approach until more data are available.

In this single-center retrospective study, allograft survival rates at one and five years for positive-crossmatch living-donor kidneys were 90 and 69 percent, respectively, while survival rates for negative-crossmatch control living-donor kidneys (matched for sex, race, age, and other factors) were 98 and 81 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-abo-sensitization-and-desensitization-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H518915721\"><span class=\"h3\">BK viremia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of BK viremia (BKV) may be higher among patients desensitized with IVIG and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>. This was shown in a cohort study that compared 187 desensitized transplant recipients with 284 nondesensitized recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-abo-sensitization-and-desensitization-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. By 12 months of follow-up, there was a higher incidence of BKV among desensitized patients compared with nondesensitized patients (20 versus 10 percent, respectively), and BKV-free survival was higher in the nondesensitized group.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h1\">FUTURE OF ABO BLOOD GROUP INCOMPATIBILITY AND HLA DESENSITIZATION PROTOCOLS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Excellent long-term results (with an acceptance of a high rate of antibody-mediated rejection [AMR] in HLA-incompatible transplantation and an awareness that early graft loss will be likely greater than is currently experienced in nonsensitized recipients) are needed to justify the financial cost and resource utilization, particularly with the low-dose intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) protocols. If long-term allograft function is routinely maintained using either of these protocols, an overall financial benefit in terms of healthcare dollars will be realized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-abo-sensitization-and-desensitization-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p>Additional comparative studies between the high- and low-dose IVIG protocols are needed. Further information regarding what level of antibody titer may be amenable to transplantation with or without desensitization is also needed, as is information on the appropriate adjunctive desensitization treatments. For patients with the option of continuing hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis, any long-term survival benefit from transplantation using an intensive desensitization protocol with uncertain results, as compared with continued dialysis, remains to be determined.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h1\">DONOR EXCHANGE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An alternative to either ABO blood group incompatibility (ABOI) or HLA desensitization is the use of a paired-exchange program. Although fraught with ethical and potentially legal concerns, willing participants can choose to allow either an ABO- or HLA-incompatible donor in one case to donate his or her kidney to an alternate recipient, also with an ABO- or HLA-incompatible donor, who is agreeable to donating his or her kidney to the remaining recipient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-abo-sensitization-and-desensitization-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/96-98\" class=\"abstract_t\">96-98</a>].</p><p>This process avoids the need for desensitization and provides a living-donor allograft (LDA) to each recipient. Obviously, both parties must be in full agreement and have an understanding of the potential posttransplantation ramifications, as well as making a decision on whether or not the parties should remain anonymous to one another.</p><p>Paired-exchange programs can help provide allografts to a select number of individuals. In a single-center study, for example, marked success was reported among 22 patients who received 10 paired donations, including two triple exchanges [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-abo-sensitization-and-desensitization-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>]. However, this approach is unlikely to have a significant impact on reducing the waitlist time when the exchange program is confined to an individual transplant center.</p><p>Increasing the exchange programs to a regional or national level would potentially expand the number of suitable donor pairs considerably. This was shown in a modeling study in which the success of such programs was analyzed using increasing population sizes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-abo-sensitization-and-desensitization-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>]. In the United States, a donor kidney exchange program was implemented in Region 1 of the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) system, resulting in limited early success [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-abo-sensitization-and-desensitization-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Development of a national kidney paired donation (KPD) system is underway in the United States through the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN).</p><p>The use of donor exchange programs to perform waitlist exchange (wherein the incompatible donor donates to an individual on the waiting list, and the incompatible recipient moves to the front of the waitlist), as compared with paired exchange, is somewhat controversial. This process may result in even longer delays for those patients already with the longest wait times, in particular blood group O recipients. Such a strategy may not be acceptable to some patients, particularly those with blood group O [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-abo-sensitization-and-desensitization-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31\"><span class=\"h2\">Acceptable mismatch program</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In Europe, an acceptable mismatch program is in place that assists in providing deceased-donor allografts (DDAs) to highly sensitized individuals through an enhanced distribution and immunologic screening protocol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hla-and-abo-sensitization-and-desensitization-in-renal-transplantation/abstract/102,103\" class=\"abstract_t\">102,103</a>]. Using this protocol, there is no statistically significant difference in graft survival in the highly sensitized recipients versus that of non-HLA-sensitized recipients.</p><p>Despite success with these programs in increasing the likelihood of an acceptable DDA being offered to a potential recipient highly sensitized to HLA antigens, some authors note that a pool of patients remain essentially nontransplantable, secondary to broad immunogenicity. For this reason, further investigation of desensitization protocols continues.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20758317\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A significant number of kidney transplant candidates have living donors that are human leukocyte antigen (HLA) or ABO blood group incompatible (ABOI), but otherwise able to donate.
