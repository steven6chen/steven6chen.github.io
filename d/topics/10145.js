NETs can arise at a number of sites throughout the body, including the thymus, lung, gastrointestinal tract, and ovaries. The gastrointestinal tract is the most frequently involved site, while lung is the second most common.

Lung NETs are the most common primary lung neoplasm in children, typically presenting in late adolescence. Typical NETs, which are low-grade tumors with a low mitotic rate, are approximately four times more common than atypical NETs, which are intermediate-grade tumors with a higher mitotic rate <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> necrosis.

At one end of the spectrum are typical NETs, which are low-grade (well-differentiated), slowly growing neoplasms that rarely metastasize to extrathoracic structures. At the other end of the spectrum are the high-grade (poorly differentiated) neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs), as typified by small cell lung cancer (SCLC) and large cell NEC, which behave aggressively, with rapid tumor growth and early distant dissemination. The biologic behavior of atypical NETs is intermediate between typical NETs and SCLC.

In the 2004 World Health Organization (WHO) classification, the spectrum of lung NETs ranges from hyperplastic neuroendocrine cell lesions (carcinoid tumorlets and diffuse idiopathic pulmonary neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia [DIPNECH]) to the high-grade small cell (SCLC) and large cell NECs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F50502\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50502 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors-epidemiology-risk-factors-classification-histology-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Coexpression of these preinvasive neuroendocrine cell lesions does not seem to affect prognosis, although the number of series with long-term follow-up is limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors-epidemiology-risk-factors-classification-histology-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].

Cytologic atypia is also characteristic, but it is insufficiently diagnostic in the absence of these features.

Patients may have a cough or wheeze, hemoptysis, chest pain, or recurrent pneumonia in the same pulmonary segment or lobe due to bronchial obstruction. Due to misdiagnosis, the diagnosis of a lung neuroendocrine tumor (NET) is often delayed, and patients may receive several courses of antibiotics to treat recurrent pneumonia before the tumor is diagnosed.

Although it is encountered more often in patients with liver metastases, carcinoid syndrome is uncommon overall, even in patients with disseminated disease. As an example, in a population-based series derived from the linked Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database, 3002 of the 9512 patients with NETs had origin in the lung or other respiratory organs; 229 (8 percent) had carcinoid syndrome at the time of initial diagnosis (compared with 31 percent of those with a small bowel primary) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lung-neuroendocrine-carcinoid-tumors-epidemiology-risk-factors-classification-histology-diagnosis-and-staging/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The frequency of carcinoid syndrome among those with localized tumors was 83 of 1044 (8 percent); among those with regional disease, it was also 8 percent (19 of 239), and among those with distant metastases, it was 15 percent (30 of 196). In contrast, among patients with small bowel primary NETs, the rates of carcinoid syndrome at diagnosis for patients with localized, regional, and distant disease were 19, 37, and 56 percent, respectively.</p><p>When carcinoid syndrome occurs in the setting of a lung NET, symptoms may be atypical, with episodes of flushing and related manifestations that are particularly prolonged <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> severe, and accompanied by other symptoms.

Abdominal CT scan is typically performed to evaluate for liver metastases. CT scans should be performed both before and after the administration of intravenous contrast with arterial and portal-venous phases (ie, multiphasic contrast-enhanced CT) because NET liver metastases are often hypervascular, becoming isodense relative to the liver parenchyma after contrast administration. As a result of its greater sensitivity for liver metastases, some physicians prefer MRI over CT for assessing the status of the liver in patients with NETs.
