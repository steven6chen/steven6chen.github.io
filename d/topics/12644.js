Of the acute leukemias, acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) occurs five times more commonly than acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Survival rates for ALL have improved dramatically since the 1980s, with a current five-year overall survival rates estimated at greater than 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-outcome-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>]. This improvement in survival is due to treatment of a large number of children on sequential standardized research protocols. Approximately 75 to 80 percent of children with newly diagnosed ALL participate in such trials, the goals of which are to improve clinical outcomes while minimizing acute toxicities and late-occurring adverse events.</p><p>The outcome of ALL in children is reviewed here.

A majority (60 to 75 percent) of patients who relapse after successful completion of an initial therapy regimen do so within the first year of completion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-outcome-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

Children at higher risk of relapse include those with persistent minimal residual disease after induction chemotherapy, as well as mutations such as <em>IKZF1</em> and <em>KMT2A</em> (<em>MLL</em>), which are associated with chemotherapy resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-outcome-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. </p><p>As survival from childhood leukemia increases, there has also been an increase in the proportion of children who are &quot;cured&quot; from their disease, defined as the proportion of survivors for whom, as a group, there is no excess mortality compared with the general population. In one study, data on children diagnosed with leukemia during 1971 to 2000 in Great Britain demonstrated an increase in the cure rate from 25 to 68 percent by 1995 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-outcome-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>In another study, the estimated cumulative risk of leukemic relapse 30 years after the induction of remission for those with 10 years of EFS was 0.6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-outcome-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. For the subgroup of children not receiving radiation therapy, long-term survival (98.3 percent at 30 years) was similar to that of the general United States population matched for age, sex, and race.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment-related mortality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While the vast majority of children with ALL enjoy long-term <span class=\"nowrap\">survival/cure,</span> the serious nature of the disease, as well as the aggressiveness of the treatment programs employed in obtaining such results (eg, use of corticosteroids, central lines, antibiotics, chemotherapy, hematopoietic cell transplantation), have resulted in significant treatment-related mortality (TRM).</p><p>Much of the TRM occurs during the first year of ALL treatment, often during induction or shortly thereafter. Estimates of overall TRM (ie, deaths during induction plus during first complete remission) have ranged from 2.6 to 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-outcome-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/45-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-48</a>]. As an example, in a study from the Nordic countries covering 1652 children with ALL diagnosed between 1992 through 2001, TRM during induction and TRM while in first CR were 1.2 and 2.2 percent, respectively, with infection being the most frequent cause of death (68 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-outcome-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. The presence of Down syndrome (RR 4.5, 95% CI 2.0-10) significantly increases the risk for TRM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-outcome-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Down syndrome'</a> below.)</p><p>Rates of late mortality among survivors of childhood leukemia have improved over time. One analysis performed by the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) evaluated late mortality among over 34,000 survivors of childhood cancer treated from 1970 through 1999 with a median follow-up of 21 years, including a cohort of 8500 patients who had survived at least five years after a diagnosis of childhood ALL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-outcome-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. In the group as a whole, later decades demonstrated a significant decline in mortality rates, reflecting fewer deaths due to recurrence and long-term toxicities. Early cohorts had a treatment-related mortality of 18 percent in the following 25 years. Long term survival has increased in more recent studies, with a long term survival of 88 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-outcome-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. The cause of death was evenly split between progression (2.0 percent) and long-term toxicities (2.1 percent). Childhood ALL was one of four diagnoses for which temporal reductions in 15-year rates of death followed temporal reductions in therapeutic exposure. Subsequent neoplasms were the most common cause of treatment-related mortality (1.4 percent at 15 years).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Down syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with trisomy 21 are at increased risk for development of several hematopoietic disorders, including transient myeloproliferative disease during the newborn period, acute myeloid leukemia (most commonly AML, not otherwise specified, acute megakaryoblastic leukemia in the WHO classification; formerly described as FAB M7 subtype) later in infancy, and both myeloid and lymphoid leukemias in childhood (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F110239\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110239 \">table 1</a>).

Children with DS who develop ALL are usually younger than 10 years of age and often respond to chemotherapy as well as do children without DS. However, children with DS are more likely to experience severe toxicity with standard chemotherapy regimens, particularly those requiring <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methotrexate</a>, and often require reduced doses of chemotherapy. Because children with DS have a higher incidence of treatment-related toxicity, their survival rate is generally inferior to that of children without DS, [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-outcome-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/49,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,53</a>] with a five-year event free survival of 65 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-outcome-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. In addition, prognostic factors in DS-ALL differ markedly from non-DS-ALL. Factors associated with a good prognosis in DS-ALL include age &lt;6 years, low white blood cell count (&lt;10,000), <em>ETV6-RUNX1</em> mutations, and high hyperdiploidy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-outcome-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. </p><p>In an international study of patients enrolled on prospective trials, the outcomes of 653 children with DS were compared with those of 4445 children with ALL who did not have DS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-outcome-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].

Of the patients with DS-associated ALL, 18 died during induction (13 infectious, five noninfectious) and 32 died of treatment-related causes in complete remission (25 infectious, seven noninfectious). These findings emphasize the need for providing aggressive supportive care for patients with DS and ALL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-outcome-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. &#160;</p><p>In addition, the frequency of genetic abnormalities seen in ALL that develops in children with DS is different from that of ALL that develops in children without DS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-outcome-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/55,57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,57,58</a>]. Approximately 40 percent will have a normal karyotype. While <em>ETV6-RUNX1</em> (30 percent) and trisomies (30 percent) are the most common genetic abnormalities seen in common B cell precursor ALL in children without DS, these mutations were much less frequent in patients with DS (<em>ETV6-RUNX1</em>: 2.5 percent and trisomies 4 and 10: 7.7 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-outcome-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].

The most common genetic abnormality seen in ALL that develops in children with DS is overexpression of <em>CRLF2 </em>(in 62 percent). Fifty percent of DS patients with <em>CRLF2</em> over-expression are associated with <em>JAK2</em> mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-outcome-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59</a>]. Although <em>JAK2</em> mutations and <em>CRLF2</em> overexpression have clearly been associated with poor prognosis in patients with non-DS ALL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-outcome-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>], the prognostic significance of these molecular changes in DS-ALL remains unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-outcome-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/59-62\" class=\"abstract_t\">59-62</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">LATE EFFECTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As long-term survival in ALL improves, more children experience late adverse effects, including central nervous system (CNS) impairment, decreased linear growth, cardiotoxicity, infertility, cataracts, and an increased incidence of secondary cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-outcome-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>], as well as an overall decreased health status due to such factors as neurocognitive dysfunction, endocrinopathies, depression, fatigue, and anxiety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-outcome-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/64-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">64-67</a>].</p><p>The occurrence of specific complications depends upon the patient's age and the type and intensity of therapy with which they were treated.

In this analysis of 273 young adults from a single center, cranial radiation increased the risk of adiposity, insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, and higher leptin levels. In contrast, in a different multivariate analysis, increasing BMI was associated with higher level of corticosteroid exposure but not exposure to cranial radiotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-outcome-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>].</p><p>A prospective study from a single center of 456 children who were treated under a single protocol found that the prevalence of obesity in the 248 ALL survivors who attained adult height was comparable to that of the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-outcome-of-acute-lymphoblastic-leukemia-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>].

Although no meningioma had been detected in patients treated with lower radiation dose (18 Gy) after 1980, it remains unknown whether these patients will develop a meningioma over time as the latency period was shorter for these patients.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Outcome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long-term complications are related to the type and intensity of the treatment regimen. Patients with high-risk ALL receive more aggressive chemotherapy and are at greater risk for acute and chronic adverse effects. Late effects include neurodevelopmental impairment, growth retardation, cardiotoxicity, risk for second malignancies, and endocrinopathies, including impaired glucose and insulin metabolism, and infertility. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Late effects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because they are at risk for long-term complications, it is crucial that survivors of childhood ALL continue regular follow-up with their oncologists after the cessation of chemotherapy. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Long-term follow-up'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">SEER Cancer Statistic Review, 1973-1999.
