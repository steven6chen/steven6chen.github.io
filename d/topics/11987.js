In addition to the risk of hypertension, obesity further enhances total cardiovascular risk and all-cause mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-and-weight-reduction-in-hypertension/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overweight-and-obesity-in-adults-health-consequences\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overweight and obesity in adults: Health consequences&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The importance of these associations was illustrated in a review from the Framingham Heart Study, in which participants were prospectively followed for up to 44 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-and-weight-reduction-in-hypertension/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. It was estimated that excess body weight (including overweight and obesity) accounted for approximately 26 percent of cases of hypertension in men and 28 percent in women and for approximately 23 percent of cases of coronary heart disease in men and 15 percent in women.</p><p>Similar findings were noted in a report from the Nurses' Health Study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-and-weight-reduction-in-hypertension/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The BMI at age 18 years and at midlife were positively associated with the occurrence of hypertension (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F76866\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76866 \">figure 1</a>). Weight gain was also associated with increased risk; the relative risks of hypertension in women who gained 5.0 to 9.9 kg and &ge;25.0 kg were 1.7 and 5.2, respectively (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F52842\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52842 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS OF HYPERTENSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rise in blood pressure seen with obesity is initially associated with an elevation in cardiac output and a relatively normal systemic vascular resistance (SVR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-and-weight-reduction-in-hypertension/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, normotensive obese patients have the same cardiac output but an SVR that is below that in lean normotensives. Thus, the hemodynamic difference between hypertensive and normotensive obese subjects is an elevation in SVR in hypertensives, findings similar to those in lean subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-and-weight-reduction-in-hypertension/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In addition, obese individuals may have increased activation of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-and-weight-reduction-in-hypertension/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>These hemodynamic alterations plus abnormalities in lipid and glucose metabolism appear to be related to fat distribution as well as to total body weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-and-weight-reduction-in-hypertension/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In particular, the risk is greatest in those patients with abdominal (also called upper body or central) obesity, which is a major component of the metabolic syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-and-weight-reduction-in-hypertension/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mechanism by which obesity raises the blood pressure is not well understood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-and-weight-reduction-in-hypertension/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. One theory proposes a central role for peripheral insulin resistance, leading to impaired glucose tolerance and hyperinsulinemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-and-weight-reduction-in-hypertension/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. A variety of mechanisms have been proposed to explain how hyperinsulinemia might increase blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-and-weight-reduction-in-hypertension/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. These include increased sympathetic activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-and-weight-reduction-in-hypertension/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], volume expansion due to increased renal sodium reabsorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-and-weight-reduction-in-hypertension/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], endothelial dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-and-weight-reduction-in-hypertension/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], upregulation of angiotensin II receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-and-weight-reduction-in-hypertension/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], and decreased cardiac natriuretic peptide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-and-weight-reduction-in-hypertension/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Despite these observations, the role of insulin resistance or hyperinsulinemia as a cause of hypertension remains unproven [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-and-weight-reduction-in-hypertension/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>If insulin is important in the pathogenesis of hypertension, there is substantial interpatient variability, and some additional factor or factors must also be present. One such factor is genetic susceptibility to the development of hypertension or to the effects of insulin on blood pressure. As an example, racial differences have been described in the relationship between blood pressure and insulin resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-and-weight-reduction-in-hypertension/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Another possibility is that the effects of insulin on blood pressure may in part be mediated by other factors, such as the melanocortin pathway, as noted below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Sleep apnea syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The sleep apnea syndrome is an additional contributing factor to the development of hypertension in obese patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-and-weight-reduction-in-hypertension/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Activation of the sympathetic nervous system, enhanced aldosterone levels, and increased levels of endothelin by repeated episodes of hypoxia are thought to be responsible in part for the elevation in blood pressure in this disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-and-weight-reduction-in-hypertension/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-secondary-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of secondary hypertension&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Leptin-melanocortin pathway</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The correlation between the serum concentration of leptin, a protein that signals the brain about the quantity of stored fat, and body fat content in humans is approximately 0.9. This and other observations have led to the suggestion that, with increasing adiposity, leptin acts as a negative feedback &quot;adipostatic&quot; signal to brain centers controlling energy intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-and-weight-reduction-in-hypertension/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>] (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F86697\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86697 \">figure 3</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-contribution-and-pathophysiology-of-obesity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetic contribution and pathophysiology of obesity&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There is evidence that leptin may have a role in obesity-related hypertension, particularly via increased sympathetic activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-and-weight-reduction-in-hypertension/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p>The melanocortin receptor, which is expressed on downstream targets of leptin- and insulin-responsive neurons, is involved in the regulation of energy balance and may also modulate blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-and-weight-reduction-in-hypertension/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. As an example, the increase in sympathetic nerve activity induced by hyperinsulinemia can be diminished by antagonizing the melanocortin receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-and-weight-reduction-in-hypertension/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFECTS OF WEIGHT REDUCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The relation between obesity and hypertension is clinically important because weight loss may lead to a significant fall in systemic blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-and-weight-reduction-in-hypertension/abstract/23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-26</a>]. The magnitude of the diet-induced decline in blood pressure was assessed in a 2016 Cochrane review that found a mean fall in blood pressure of 4.<span class=\"nowrap\">5/3</span>.2 mmHg with weight-loss diets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-and-weight-reduction-in-hypertension/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Weight-reducing drugs, particularly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=orlistat-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">orlistat</a>, can also reduce blood pressure, although the effect may not be as large as with weight-loss diets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-and-weight-reduction-in-hypertension/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. Weight-loss surgery (eg, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass), in addition to lifestyle interventions, also reduces blood pressure, although the effect may not be significantly greater than lifestyle interventions alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-and-weight-reduction-in-hypertension/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The fall in blood pressure with weight loss is accompanied by a decrease in arterial stiffness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-and-weight-reduction-in-hypertension/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. </p><p>The decline in blood pressure induced by weight loss can also occur in the absence of dietary sodium restriction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-and-weight-reduction-in-hypertension/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]; however, modest sodium restriction (a decline in intake of 20 to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/day)</span> may produce an additive antihypertensive effect to that produced by weight reduction alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-and-weight-reduction-in-hypertension/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diet-in-the-treatment-and-prevention-of-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diet in the treatment and prevention of hypertension&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Long-term effects of weight reduction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The persistence of weight loss provides substantial benefits in terms of hypertension. In the Framingham study, the long-term effect of weight loss was evaluated among 623 overweight 30- to 49-year-olds and 604 overweight 50- to 65-year-olds over an eight-year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-and-weight-reduction-in-hypertension/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Sustained weight loss of 6.8 kg or more was associated with a 22 and 26 percent reduction in relative risk of developing hypertension (defined by <span class=\"nowrap\">140/90</span> mmHg) for the two groups, respectively. </p><p>However, most people who lose weight regain the loss over time, possibly because of a persistence of hormonal adaptions to weight loss that encourage weight regain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-and-weight-reduction-in-hypertension/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In one study of 18 obese and 23 never obese subjects, for example, weight loss of 10 to 20 percent was associated with a reduction in total and resting energy expenditure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-and-weight-reduction-in-hypertension/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>], a change that will retard further weight loss (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F63172\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63172 \">figure 4</a>). These observations suggest a strong mechanism that tends to maintain excess body weight.</p><p>Thus, an increase in physical activity should always be added to diet in order to provide more sustained weight loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-and-weight-reduction-in-hypertension/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. In addition, markedly obese patients may require surgical therapy to produce and maintain an adequate degree of weight loss. However, even with significant weight loss after gastric bypass, the degree of blood pressure reduction may be less than anticipated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-and-weight-reduction-in-hypertension/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obesity-in-adults-overview-of-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obesity in adults: Overview of management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">ANTIHYPERTENSIVE DRUGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antihypertensive agents are often necessary if adequate weight loss cannot be achieved or sustained. Recommendations for antihypertensive therapy in patients with hypertension are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=choice-of-drug-therapy-in-primary-essential-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Choice of drug therapy in primary (essential) hypertension&quot;</a>.) </p><p>There is evidence that, in general, the different antihypertensive drug classes are equally effective in preventing cardiovascular disease in obese patients. In a meta-analysis of 22 trials including 135,715 hypertensive patients, for example, the effect of calcium channel blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and diuretics or beta blockers on total major cardiovascular events was similar and did not differ according to whether patients were normal weight, overweight, or obese [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-and-weight-reduction-in-hypertension/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. </p><p>However, in view of the adverse metabolic effects of diuretics and beta blockers and the predisposition in obese patients to have impaired fasting glucose or overt diabetes, some clinicians have recommended either an angiotensin inhibitor or a calcium channel blocker as the preferred choices for first-line therapy in obese patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-and-weight-reduction-in-hypertension/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-thiazide-diuretics-in-patients-with-primary-essential-hypertension#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of thiazide diuretics in patients with primary (essential) hypertension&quot;, section on 'Side effects'</a>.)</p><p>Even low-dose thiazide diuretics may worsen glucose tolerance and lead to overt diabetes in obese patients with hypertension who frequently have underlying metabolic abnormalities.

However, there was no difference in new onset diabetes between chlorthalidone and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amlodipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amlodipine</a>. </p><p/><p>There is a potentially greater problem with the use of beta blockers in obese patients in that they may make weight reduction more difficult. A randomized controlled trial of 878 patients with mild hypertension compared the effect of caloric restriction in patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorthalidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorthalidone</a> (25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day),</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atenolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atenolol</a> (50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day),</span> or placebo: the mean weight reduction at six months in the three groups was 6.9, 3.0, and 4.4 kg, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-and-weight-reduction-in-hypertension/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].
