The periprocedural complications related to PCI will be reviewed here. The complications of cardiac catheterization are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-diagnostic-cardiac-catheterization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of diagnostic cardiac catheterization&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Improvements in devices, the use of stents, and aggressive antiplatelet therapy have significantly reduced the incidence of major periprocedural complications of PCI over the past 15 to 20 years. As an example, the need for emergent coronary bypass surgery (CABG) decreased in two series from 1.5 percent in 1992 to 0.14 percent in 2000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-complications-of-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], and from 2.9 percent in 1979 to 1994 to 0.3 percent in 2000 to 2003 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-complications-of-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Emergency CABG for failed PCI'</a> below.)</p><p>In this discussion, PCI refers to any therapeutic procedure during which a wire or catheter is inserted into a coronary artery. Balloon angioplasty without stenting will be referred to as percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA). When clinically important data specific to PTCA are available, it will be given. The term PCI will be used when studies include patients who have had either PTCA or stenting. Studies of stenting alone will be presented as such.</p><p>The widespread use of intracoronary stents rather than balloon angioplasty alone has resulted in the periprocedural complications of PTCA been being largely replaced by complications seen with stenting.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H266822817\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE AND CAUSES OF EARLY MORTALITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The widespread use of stents (compared to balloon angioplasty) and improvements with time in stent design and technique have led to a decreasing risk of major acute complications and no increase in mortality rates despite the increasing complexity of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-complications-of-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. A report from the American College of Cardiology National Cardiovascular Data registry included over 100,000 percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) procedures (stent placement in 77 percent) performed between 1998 and 2000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-complications-of-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The incidences of in-hospital Q wave myocardial infarction, urgent coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG), or death were 0.4, 1.9, and 1.4 percent, respectively. These values may represent an overestimate of current experience, as most laboratories report emergency CABG rates below 0.5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-complications-of-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/1,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5</a>].</p><p>A 2013 report from the Cleveland (United States) Clinic&rsquo;s institutional PCI registry presented the incidence and causes of death within 30 days of 4078 PCIs performed between 2009 and 2011 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-complications-of-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There were 81 deaths (2 percent), of which 58 percent were cardiac and 42 percent noncardiac. There were 19 deaths after the initial hospital discharge.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Only 42 percent of the deaths were attributable to PCI-related complications.

Hospitals should have a volume of at least 400 procedures per year, and operators should perform at least 75 procedures per year.</p><p>The validity of the <span class=\"nowrap\">ACC/AHA/SCAI</span> guidelines in the era of coronary artery stenting has been demonstrated in a number of studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-complications-of-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>]. The magnitude of this effect was illustrated in an analysis of a hospital discharge database that included over 360,000 admissions for PCI between 1998 and 2000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-complications-of-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Hospital volume was classified as low (5 to 199 cases per year), medium (200 to 399 cases per year), high (400 to 999 cases per year), and very high (over 1000 cases per year).</p><p>Crude in-hospital mortality rates for the low-, medium-, high-, and very high-volume hospitals were 2.6, 1.8, 1.6, and 1.4 percent, respectively. After adjustment for clinical risk variables (including age, gender, race, acute myocardial infarction (MI), diabetes, and other factors), only low-volume hospitals had a significantly increased risk of in-hospital mortality (adjusted odds ratio 1.21).</p><p>Worse outcomes in low-volume hospitals were also noted in a review of over 107,000 patients who underwent PCI in New York state between 1998 and 2000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-complications-of-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Only 2.3 percent of procedures were performed at hospitals with an annual volume below 400.</p><p>A report from the greater Paris area registry suggested that the increase in in-hospital mortality in low volume centers was limited to emergency procedures (eg, primary PCI for ST elevation MI), with no difference in nonemergent procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-complications-of-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. This probably reflects differential baseline risk of the patient populations, as mortality differences would be difficult to detect in very low-risk elective procedures.</p><p>Operator volume is also a determinant of outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-complications-of-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/9,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,13</a>]. The importance of operator volume was evaluated in a review from a regional consortium of 18,504 consecutive PCIs performed by 165 operators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-complications-of-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. An inverse correlation was noted between major adverse cardiac events (MACE) occurring in-hospital and operator volume quintile. Patients treated by operators in the lowest two quintiles (1 to 33 and 34 to 89 cases per year) had, compared to those treated by operators in the highest quintile (207 to 582 cases per year), a significantly higher rate of MACE (7.4 and 6.1 compared to 4.2 percent, adjusted odds ratio 1.63 for both quintiles one and two), but not an increase in cardiac mortality.</p><p>Similar findings were noted in the New York State review [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-complications-of-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Procedures performed by operators with an annual volume of less than 75 cases were associated with a significant increase in the risk of same-day or same-stay CABG, but no significant difference in mortality. However, the risk of mortality was significantly increased when the hospital volume was below 400, and the operator volume was below 75 (2.7 versus 0.6 percent with both hospital and operator volumes above these thresholds, odds ratio 5.92).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Absence of on-site cardiac surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We and others believe it is reasonable to perform elective PCI at hospitals without on-site cardiac surgical services, as multiple studies have shown that outcomes are similar for stable patients undergoing PCI at hospitals with and without on-site cardiac surgical backup when measures of institutional and operator quality are evaluated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F68713\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68713 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F80948\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80948 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F61364\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61364 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-complications-of-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

Patients with ST-elevation MI, unprotected left main disease, or a left ventricular ejection fraction of less than 20 percent were excluded. There was no difference in the rates of the two co-primary outcomes at hospitals without or with cardiac surgery: mortality at six weeks (0.9 versus 1.0 percent, respectively; difference, -0.04 percentage points, 95% CI -0.31 to 0.23) or major adverse cardiac events at nine months (12.1 versus 11.2 percent, respectively; difference, 0.92 percentage points, 95% CI 0.04 to 1.80).

With regard to the co-primary composite end points of major adverse cardiac events (death, MI, repeat revascularization, or stroke) at 30 days (safety end point) and at 12 months (effectiveness end point), PCI procedures performed at hospitals without on-site cardiac surgery were noninferior (9.5 versus 9.4 percent; relative risk 1.00, 95% one-sided upper confidence limit, 1.22 and 17.3 versus 17.8 percent, relative risk 0.98, 95% one-sided upper confidence limit, 1.13).</p><p/><p>The 2011 American College of Cardiology Foundation <span class=\"nowrap\">(ACCF)/AHA/SCAI</span> guideline for PCI, written before the two randomized trials presented above, stated that elective PCI may be considered (weak recommendation) at institutions without on-site cardiac surgery that met certain institutional, operator, and patient selection criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-complications-of-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. In 2014, the <span class=\"nowrap\">SCAI/ACC/AHA</span> published an expert consensus document on PCI without on-site surgical backup. That document, while not making new broad recommendations, indicates that recommendations made in the 2011 guideline are reasonable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-complications-of-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In addition, it provides recommendations for facility and personnel requirements, requirements for off-site surgical backup and case selection, and patient and lesion characteristics that could be unsuitable for nonemergency procedures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F94437%7ECARD%2F94435%7ECARD%2F94440%7ECARD%2F94438\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94437 graphicRef94435 graphicRef94440 graphicRef94438 \">table 4A-D</a>).</p><p>The discussion of primary PCI at hospitals without on-site cardiac surgery is found elsewhere.

Such models have typically been validated only within the institution at which they were developed, and some were based upon patient populations treated with balloon angioplasty alone.</p><p>In one analysis, five of these multivariable mortality models were compared for their ability to predict in-hospital mortality in 4448 patients in the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute Dynamic Registry who underwent PCI from 1997 to 1999 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-complications-of-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. During the index hospitalization, 64 patients died (for an in-hospital mortality rate of 1.4 percent).</p><p>This outcome was closely approximated by three of the models: the New York state model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-complications-of-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>], the Northern New England model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-complications-of-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], and the Cleveland Clinic model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-complications-of-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Two other models were less accurate: the University of Michigan model, which predicted 47 deaths (1.1 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-complications-of-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], and the American College of Cardiology Registry model, which predicted 603 deaths (13.5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-complications-of-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>The Mayo Clinic developed a risk score to identify patients at increased risk for major complications after PCI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-complications-of-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The score, derived from patients who underwent PCI between 1996 and 1999 and then validated in 2000, is relevant to current clinical practice since it was performed after stenting became routine, the patients were usually treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ticlopidine-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ticlopidine</a>, and intravenous glycoprotein <span class=\"nowrap\">IIb/IIIa</span> inhibitors were available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-complications-of-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>A predictive point score was based upon eight clinical and angiographic variables, including a number of high-risk parameters such as shock, heart failure, urgent or emergent PCI, and left main or multivessel disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F54653\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54653 \">table 6</a>). Major complications were defined as in-hospital mortality, ST elevation MI, urgent or emergent CABG, and stroke. In the validation cohort, the observed complication rates were comparable to the expected rates for all risk levels. Since this risk model includes three angiographic variables, a low score derived from the five clinical variables would not permit exclusion of high risk prior to intervention.</p><p>A subsequent study from the Mayo Clinic, using data from over 9000 PCIs performed between 2000 and 2005, developed two risk-prediction models, one for mortality alone and one for all major adverse cardiovascular events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-complications-of-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The model consisted of seven baseline clinical and noninvasive variables: age, MI within the past 24 hours, preprocedural shock, serum creatinine, left ventricular ejection fraction, heart failure, and peripheral artery disease. The two models successfully predicted the risk of adverse events during the index hospitalization. Limitations of the study include performance at a single referral center in a lower-risk patient population.</p><p>The risk models discussed above were derived from cohorts that included a high percentage of patients with a recent MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-complications-of-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Whether a preprocedural cardiac troponin (cTn) elevation in patients with stable coronary artery disease is a predictor of adverse postprocedural outcome was addressed using the EVENT registry of 7592 unselected patients undergoing PCI with stenting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-complications-of-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Of the 2382 stable EVENT patients, 142 (6 percent) were found to have baseline cTn above the upper limit of normal. Compared to patients with normal cTn, the following findings were noted at hospital discharge:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There was a significantly higher rate of in-hospital death or MI (13.4 versus 5.6 percent).

The NCDR CathPCI risk score was developed and validated from an analysis of data from 181,775 procedures performed in the United States in a broad range of institutions from 2004 to 2006 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-complications-of-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Patients were nearly evenly divided between those with ACS and those with stable disease. From an initial risk prediction model that included 21 variables, the eight with the strongest association with in-hospital mortality were included in the risk score: age, cardiogenic shock, prior heart failure, peripheral artery disease, chronic lung disease, glomerular filtration rate, New York Heart Association functional class IV, and PCI status (ST elevation MI or non-ST elevation MI). </p><p>In this population, overall in-hospital mortality following PCI was 1.27 percent, ranging from 0.65 to 4.81 percent in elective and ST-elevation MI patients, respectively.

A preprocedural elevation in cardiac troponin (cTn) also predicts adverse outcomes.

The first measure is inflation of either a PTCA balloon or perfusion balloon catheter at the site of perforation to stop the flow of blood into the pericardium (giving time for pericardiocentesis, hemodynamic stabilization, and preparation of subsequent therapies), and may also be sufficient to seal off small perforations following a 15-minute inflation. If the perforation has not sealed, and evidence of hemodynamic compromise is seen (eg, hypotension), emergency pericardiocentesis with placement of a pericardial drain should be performed. Reversal of anticoagulation should occur only after access to the pericardial space is secured as blood in the pericardium may clot, making pericardiocentesis difficult.</p><p>Significant distal perforations of small branches by guidewires can be managed by placement of embolization coils or other materials. This maneuver will result in total occlusion of that arterial segment.</p><p>The covered stent, produced by attaching a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) membrane to one stent or sandwiching such a layer between two stents, may be the stent of choice for treating coronary artery perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-complications-of-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].

Some experts advocate that the dosing of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a> during PCI should be guided by measurement of activated clotting times. Over-anticoagulation, especially with concomitant administration of GP <span class=\"nowrap\">2b/3a</span> receptor blockers is associated with higher risk of hemorrhage.

Post-procedural heparin is no longer recommended since the majority of abrupt closures occur immediately after the procedure, and the incidence of other ischemic events has decreased with the use of stents and antiplatelet agents given during or immediately after PCI.

Two alternative approaches are available: mechanical clamp compression and, more important, arterial puncture closing devices, which may increase the risk of complications. These issues are discussed elsewhere.

In our experience, it is the most common cause of unexpected mortality after diagnostic or interventional cardiac catheterization. Retroperitoneal bleeding is frequently related to artery puncture that is above the inguinal ligament and can be prevented in most cases by careful attention to anatomic landmarks and fluoroscopy of the femoral head prior to needle puncture. Retroperitoneal hemorrhage can also occur with puncture sites below the inguinal ligament, as blood can track along the vascular fascial sheath into the retroperitoneum or rectus sheath. Even with appropriate access position, back wall punctures that exit above the inguinal ligament may result in retroperitoneal bleeding and may not be sealed by manual compression or closure devices. Injudicious advancement of the guidewire or sheath by an inexperienced operator can also traumatize the iliac artery or the lateral circumflex artery and result in bleeding into the retroperitoneal space.</p><p>The event is usually recognized by hemodynamic compromise. It can sometimes be mistaken for the more common and benign &quot;vagal&quot; reaction, since it may also present with profound bradycardia and associated hypotension. It is distinguished by only a transient response to initial volume loading and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atropine</a>.</p><p>Successful management depends on early recognition and volume resuscitation with crystalloid and blood. The diagnosis is usually confirmed by computed tomography imaging. The vascular surgical team should be alerted, although surgical management is not commonly needed or helpful. We have used percutaneous methods including balloon inflation or placement of a covered stent to tamponade or seal the bleeding segment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H59456800\"><span class=\"h2\">Radial artery access</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with acute coronary syndromes treated with PCI, we prefer access using the radial rather than the femoral artery to reduce the risk of major access site bleeding. For stable patients, either access site is acceptable, as we believe there is insufficient evidence to warrant a recommendation for use of the radial artery in all patients. Use of the radial artery should be performed by properly trained operators. </p><p>Catheterization using the radial, as opposed to the common femoral, artery has the potential to reduce the risk of major access site bleeding due to the fact that the former is smaller and readily compressible. Any intervention that reduces the risk of bleeding could potentially improve outcomes given the observations of increased mortality and ischemic events in patients who bleed at the time of PCI. This is particularly true for patients undergoing catheterization for an acute coronary syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=periprocedural-bleeding-in-patients-undergoing-percutaneous-coronary-intervention#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Periprocedural bleeding in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention&quot;, section on 'Outcomes after bleeding'</a>.)</p><p>The best evidence supporting better outcomes with radial catheterization comes from a 2016 meta-analysis of 24 trials (n = 22,843), including the four large, contemporary trials of acute coronary syndrome patients: RIVAL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-complications-of-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>], MATRIX [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-complications-of-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>], RIFLE-STEACS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-complications-of-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>], and STEMI RADIAL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-complications-of-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/97,98\" class=\"abstract_t\">97,98</a>]. Comparing radial with femoral access, the risk of following end points were significantly reduced:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Major bleeding (odds ratio [OR] 0.53, 95% CI 0.42-0.65).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All-cause mortality (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.59-0.87).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Major adverse cardiovascular events (OR 0.84, 95% CI 0.75-0.94).</p><p/><p>In this meta-analysis, the benefits of radial access were consistent across the spectrum of patients with coronary artery disease (ie, patients with stable or unstable disease).</p><p>In patients for whom a radial artery approach may be used, we assess the palmar arch circulation prior to the procedure. The adequacy of the arch should be documented in the medical record.&nbsp;We also assess the patient for adequate hemostasis and circulation after the procedure and document the results. </p><p>For patients who undergo PCI using radial access, radial artery occlusion is a potential complication that occurs in approximately 5 percent of cases. A potential clinical consequence is the inability to use the radial artery for future access. Perfused hemostasis with non-occlusive radial artery compression, documented with confirmed perfusion of the hand during ipsilateral ulnar compression (&quot;reverse Allen&rsquo;s test&quot;), has been shown to decrease the risk of this complication. In a study of 3000 patients undergoing diagnostic coronary angiography (5 French sheath) who were randomly assigned to ulnar compression or standard hemostasis, the primary end point of 30-day radial artery occlusion occurred less often with ulnar compression (3 versus 0.9 percent; p = 0.0001) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-complications-of-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h2\">Atheroembolism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of stiff, large-bore guiding catheters results in aortic trauma and the &quot;scraping&quot; of atheromatous debris from the aortic wall, providing a potential source of systemic embolism. In a series of 1000 patients undergoing PCI, 51 percent had aortic atheromatous material retrieved from the catheter after back flow of blood; the incidence ranged from 24 to 65 percent, depending upon the shape of the catheter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/periprocedural-complications-of-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>]. There were no associated in-hospital ischemic complications, probably due to sufficient withdrawal of blood containing the debris prior to the injection of contrast. Placement of a Y-adapter on the guiding catheter as the catheter is advanced over the guidewire should be discouraged, as this prevents backbleeding of atheromatous debris from the catheter.</p><p>Atheroembolism related to cardiac catheterization and PCI is discussed in detail separately.
