As a class, they are also effective in the treatment of acute agitation, bipolar mania, and other psychiatric conditions.</p><p>Second-generation antipsychotics (SGAs), also known as atypical antipsychotics, generally have lower risk of extrapyramidal side effects and tardive dyskinesia compared with first-generation antipsychotics (FGAs). First- and second-generation antipsychotic drugs are more comparable in their clinical efficacy, with the exception of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clozapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clozapine</a>, an SGA with unique efficacy in treatment-resistant schizophrenia. Antipsychotic drugs differ from one another in dosing, route of administration, pharmacokinetics, side effect profile, and cost, factors that influence the selection of an antipsychotic drug for individual patients. </p><p>The pharmacology,<strong> </strong>administration, and comparative side effects of SGAs available in the United States, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clozapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clozapine</a>, are discussed here. The pharmacology,<strong> </strong>administration, and comparative side effects of FGAs are discussed separately, as is the use of antipsychotics in the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and acute agitation. Guidelines for the prescribing of clozapine are also discussed separately.

Of the four exceptions, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aripiprazole-short-acting-oral-and-injectable-and-long-acting-injectable-abilify-maintena-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aripiprazole</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=brexpiprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">brexpiprazole</a> are D2 receptor partial agonists and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cariprazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cariprazine</a> is a D3-preferring <span class=\"nowrap\">D3/D2</span> receptor partial agonist. Several lines of evidence support the role of these receptors in the activity of antipsychotics, most notably a strong correlation between D2 receptor binding and clinical potency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-generation-antipsychotic-medications-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] and a consistent requirement of 65 percent D2 receptor occupancy for antipsychotic efficacy in functional imaging studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-generation-antipsychotic-medications-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The fourth exception, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pimavanserin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pimavanserin</a>, is a serotonin 5HT2A inverse agonist and antagonist with no dopamine D2 affinity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-generation-antipsychotic-medications-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. &#160;</p><p>Most SGAs differ from older medications pharmacologically in that serotonin 5HT2 receptor binding exceeds their affinity for dopamine D2 receptors, whereas in FGAs this is generally not the case. Largely for that reason, 5HT2 activity has been suggested as one basis for the lower overall risk of extrapyramidal side effects (EPS) with the atypical drugs compared with FGAs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-generation-antipsychotic-medications-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Other aspects of SGA pharmacology that correlate with reduced risk of EPS include &quot;loose&quot; D2 receptor binding with rapid dissociation rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-generation-antipsychotic-medications-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] and preferential binding of drugs to receptors in limbic and cortical brain regions rather than striatal areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-generation-antipsychotic-medications-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. None of these hypotheses has been fully confirmed, and the most important message for the clinician is that the pharmacology of these drugs is complex and likely to result in some variability of side effect risk and pharmacokinetics from patient to patient.</p><p>Other elements of SGA pharmacology vary significantly among drugs, giving each agent a unique side effect profile, dosing pattern, rate of absorption, half-life, set of drug-drug interactions, and susceptibility to changes in hepatic and renal function (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F82533\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82533 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F60624\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60624 \">table 2</a>). Familiarity with these properties will aid the clinician in optimizing treatment for individual patients. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H191680206\"><span class=\"h2\">Other receptor activities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Additional receptor activities with SGAs include blockade or partial agonist activity at muscarinic, alpha-adrenergic, and histaminic receptors, with resultant anticholinergic, hypotensive, sedative, and metabolic side effects. The diversity in SGAs' affinity for these receptors leads to significant variability in the type and extent of side effects among antipsychotics. (See <a href=\"#H191680213\" class=\"local\">'Side effects'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H466014713\"><span class=\"h2\">Absorption and bioavailability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rate of absorption and bioavailability of these drugs vary significantly and may be important considerations in some cases. A drug with rapid absorption is usually preferred in an urgent situation, whereas one with slower uptake may be better tolerated. Sublingual <a href=\"topic.htm?path=asenapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">asenapine</a> is the most rapidly absorbed, with a one-hour time to peak serum concentration, followed closely by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lurasidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lurasidone</a> and the immediate-release formulation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quetiapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quetiapine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-generation-antipsychotic-medications-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>]. The longest times to peak concentration are noted with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=olanzapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">olanzapine</a>, the extended-release (XR) form of quetiapine, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pimavanserin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pimavanserin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ziprasidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ziprasidone</a>, averaging five to six hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-generation-antipsychotic-medications-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>]. </p><p>The bioavailability of two drugs, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lurasidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lurasidone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ziprasidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ziprasidone</a>, increases two- to threefold in the presence of food, hence their manufacturers' recommendations that they be taken with a meal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-generation-antipsychotic-medications-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/10,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,14</a>]. In the case of ziprasidone, it is not possible to compensate for the food effect by doubling the dose because in the absence of food, the increase in plasma level is not proportional to the oral dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-generation-antipsychotic-medications-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The XR formulation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quetiapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quetiapine</a> shows a 50 percent increase in absorption with a high-fat meal, which the manufacturer recommends avoiding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-generation-antipsychotic-medications-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Other drugs of this class may be dosed without regard for food. Use of drugs that require a meal or avoidance of a meal for optimal absorption may be most appropriate for patients who are cooperative and cognitively intact, and require sufficient patient education to ensure that patients <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> caregivers administer them correctly. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H466014897\"><span class=\"h2\">Metabolic activation and clearance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most antipsychotic drugs are metabolized primarily via the cytochrome P450 system of the liver, although they differ as to which and how many enzymes are involved, giving them somewhat different susceptibility to liver impairment and drug-drug interactions. (See <a href=\"#H466014719\" class=\"local\">'Drug-drug interactions'</a> below.)</p><p>The notable exception to this rule is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paliperidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paliperidone</a>, 80 percent of which is excreted unchanged via the kidneys, with only about 10 percent inactivated by hepatic enzymes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-generation-antipsychotic-medications-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. As a result, paliperidone is the only medication of this class for which no dose adjustment is recommended in patients with impaired liver function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-generation-antipsychotic-medications-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. The dose must be reduced, however, with mild to moderate renal dysfunction, and the drug is not recommended with severe renal impairment.</p><p>Clearance half-life affects how long it takes to achieve steady-state serum levels of a medication and the frequency of dosing required to maintain those levels. Shorter half-lives allow more rapid dose adjustments, but require more frequent drug administration. The most rapidly metabolized drugs are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quetiapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quetiapine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ziprasidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ziprasidone</a>, each with a clearance half-life of six to seven hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-generation-antipsychotic-medications-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/11,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,14</a>]. Ziprasidone is recommended exclusively for twice-daily dosing on this basis. Quetiapine's active metabolite N-desalkyl quetiapine, in contrast, has a 12-hour clearance half-life that gives the drug a longer period of clinical effectiveness and allows it to be dosed once daily. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aripiprazole-short-acting-oral-and-injectable-and-long-acting-injectable-abilify-maintena-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Aripiprazole</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=brexpiprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">brexpiprazole</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cariprazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cariprazine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-generation-antipsychotic-medications-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>] have the longest clearance half-lives at 75 hours, 91 hours, and two to four days, respectively. The majority of cariprazine&rsquo;s clinical activity appears to be due to an active metabolite with a clearance half-life of one to three weeks. These longer clearance times give the drugs relatively stable levels with once-daily dosing, but extend the time required to make dose adjustments or to clear them completely during transitions off the medication. &#160;</p><p>The presence of active metabolites may extend the effective duration of clinical activity beyond that expected for the clearance half-life of the parent compound. The consequences in patients with impaired metabolic function, who may experience either an increase in activity because of impaired clearance of the drug or decreased activity because of impaired conversion to an active metabolite, are less predictable. </p><p>SGAs with active metabolites include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aripiprazole-short-acting-oral-and-injectable-and-long-acting-injectable-abilify-maintena-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aripiprazole</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iloperidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">iloperidone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lurasidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lurasidone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pimavanserin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pimavanserin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risperidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">risperidone</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-generation-antipsychotic-medications-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/10,11,15,20,22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11,15,20,22-24</a>]. Risperidone&rsquo;s metabolite 9-hydroxyrisperidone, is marketed separately as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paliperidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paliperidone</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-generation-antipsychotic-medications-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The overlap in activity of these two drugs appears to contribute to similar clinical responses and side effects seen with the two drugs. </p><p>Patients with genetic variants of CYP 2D6 may be either poor or extensive metabolizers of some drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-generation-antipsychotic-medications-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Significant differences in clearance half-lives and associated serum levels based on these genetic polymorphisms have been reported for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aripiprazole-short-acting-oral-and-injectable-and-long-acting-injectable-abilify-maintena-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aripiprazole</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=brexpiprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">brexpiprazole</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clozapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clozapine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iloperidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">iloperidone</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-generation-antipsychotic-medications-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/20,21,23,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21,23,26</a>]. In the case of clozapine, the resulting clearance half-lives range from 4 to 66 hours. For aripiprazole and iloperidone, the difference in clearance half-lives between poor and extensive metabolizers is about twofold. Despite these differences, CYP 2D6 phenotyping or genotyping have not yet demonstrated clinical utility, and the most effective approach to address these differences is to determine a serum drug level when poor or extensive metabolism is suspected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-generation-antipsychotic-medications-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In poor metabolizers, dose reductions of 50 percent have been recommended for aripiprazole, brexpiprazole, and iloperidone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-generation-antipsychotic-medications-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/20,21,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21,23</a>]; dose reduction is also recommended for poor metabolizers of clozapine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-generation-antipsychotic-medications-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H466014719\"><span class=\"h2\">Drug-drug interactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most SGAs depend on cytochrome P450 enzymes for metabolism, and some have significant increases or decreases in serum levels when used with inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F60624\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60624 \">table 2</a>). As a general rule, however, these interactions are mild and readily manageable with dose adjustments as noted below. A list of common medications that are significant inhibitors or inducers of CYP 3A4 is provided in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F76992\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76992 \">table 3</a>). In a few cases, specific medications with overlapping side effects should be avoided, most notably those with cardiac, sedative, anticholinergic, or metabolic risk. Even in these cases, however, the risk is relative and can usually be managed without a radical change in treatment. The most noteworthy interactions are described below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=aripiprazole-short-acting-oral-and-injectable-and-long-acting-injectable-abilify-maintena-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Aripiprazole</a> &ndash; Dopamine D2 receptor blockade may be unpredictable when the partial agonist aripiprazole is given simultaneously with other antipsychotics (all of which are dopamine antagonists), as might occur during a transition between medications. This can lead in some cases to a paradoxical reduction in dopamine blockade and reduced antipsychotic effect as the dose of aripiprazole is increased. Aripiprazole is metabolized via CYP 2D6 and CYP 3A4. The manufacturer recommends a twofold dose increase in the presence of metabolic inducers such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-generation-antipsychotic-medications-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/10,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,20</a>] and a 50 percent reduction in dose with inhibitors such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoxetine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quinidine</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketoconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketoconazole</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=asenapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Asenapine</a> &ndash; With substantial metabolism occurring through both CYP 1A2 and glucuronidation, drug interactions involving asenapine tend to be mild and generally do not require an adjustment in dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/second-generation-antipsychotic-medications-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].
