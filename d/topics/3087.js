The hospitalization rate for UGIB is estimated to be sixfold higher than for lower GI bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-upper-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The incidence of UGIB is higher in men than in women (128 versus 65 per 100,000 in one study) and increases with age. The reported frequencies of specific causes of UGIB vary and have changed over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-upper-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults/abstract/3-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-8</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H8622040\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Older studies suggested that peptic ulcer disease was responsible for approximately half of UGIB, but more recent studies suggest that while still prominent, ulcer disease is now a less common cause (approximately 20 to 25 percent of cases) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-upper-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults/abstract/3,4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,6</a>].

From a pathophysiologic perspective, ulcerative and erosive lesions (gastric or duodenal ulcers, esophagitis, and gastritis) are far more common than vascular lesions (varices, angiodysplasia), mass lesions (adenocarcinoma, polyps), or traumatic lesions (Mallory-Weiss tear). Of note, the source of bleeding cannot be identified in 10 to 15 percent of patients with UGIB, probably because the culprit lesion is either difficult to identify (such as a Dieulafoy's lesion), obscured by retained blood clot at endoscopy, or because the culprit lesion healed by the time endoscopy was performed.</p><p>The most common causes of UGIB include the following (in approximate descending order of frequency) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-upper-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults/abstract/3-5,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5,8,9</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastric <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> duodenal ulcers</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Esophagogastric varices</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe or erosive esophagitis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe or erosive <span class=\"nowrap\">gastritis/duodenitis</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Portal hypertensive gastropathy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Angiodysplasia (also known as vascular ectasia)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mass lesions <span class=\"nowrap\">(polyps/cancers)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mallory-Weiss syndrome</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No lesion identified (10 to 15 percent of patients)</p><p/><p>Other less common causes of UGIB include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dieulafoy's lesion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastric antral vascular ectasia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemobilia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemosuccus pancreaticus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aortoenteric fistula</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cameron lesions</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ectopic varices</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Iatrogenic bleeding after endoscopic interventions</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8623583\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECIFIC CAUSES</span></p><p>The most common causes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB), gastroduodenal ulcer disease, severe or erosive esophagitis, and esophagogastric varices, remain pervasive in medicine. Accompanying symptoms (ulcer disease may be associated with pain or anorexia, while esophagitis may be associated with reflux symptoms), severity of bleeding (ulcers with bleeding arteries or varices typically bleed most aggressively), and type of bleeding (hematochezia plus hematemesis typically is caused by vascular lesions), may provide clues as to the diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F103148\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103148 \">table 1</a>). However, in most patients, it is not possible to predict the cause of bleeding based on clinical grounds alone, and endoscopy is required to make a definitive diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-upper-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

NSAID-induced injury results from both local effects and systemic prostaglandin inhibition. The majority of these ulcers are asymptomatic and uncomplicated. However, older adults with a prior history of bleeding ulcer disease are at increased risk for recurrent ulcers and complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-upper-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>].

Impairment of mucosal integrity by factors such as <em>H. pylori</em>, NSAIDs, or physiologic stress leads to increased cell membrane permeability to back diffusion of hydrogen ions, resulting in intramural acidosis, cell death, and ulceration. Rarely, hyperacidity is the sole cause of peptic ulceration, as in patients with Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. Control of gastric acidity is considered an essential therapeutic maneuver in patients with active UGIB. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zollinger-ellison-syndrome-gastrinoma-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (gastrinoma): Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-acute-upper-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>A sizeable body of literature suggests that gastroduodenal ulcers associated with different risk factors behave different clinically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-upper-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults/abstract/11,12,30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12,30,31</a>].

The lowest rate of rebleeding and mortality was observed in patients with <em>H. pylori</em>-positive ulcers. Patients with <em>H. pylori</em>-negative ulcers had poorer outcomes, regardless of use of NSAIDs. Patients with ulcers negative for <em>H. pylori</em> and no history of NSAID use had the worst outcomes and more severe systemic disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12560831\"><span class=\"h2\">Esophagitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Esophagitis is a common cause of upper GI pathology and bleeding.

Patients with erosive esophagitis often have a history of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-upper-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Other risk factors include medication use (eg, NSAIDS, oral bisphosphonates, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetracycline</a>) and infections (eg, <em>Candida</em>, herpes simplex virus).

The terms &quot;gastritis&quot; and &quot;duodenitis&quot; are used to denote inflammation-associated mucosal injury. However, epithelial cell injury and regeneration are not always accompanied by mucosal inflammation. This distinction has caused considerable confusion since the terms &quot;gastritis&quot; and &quot;duodenitis&quot; are often used to describe endoscopic or radiologic characteristics of the mucosa rather than specific histologic findings. Epithelial cell damage and regeneration with minimal or no associated inflammation are properly referred to as &quot;gastropathy&quot; or &quot;duodenopathy.&quot; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-diagnosis-of-gastritis-and-gastropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and diagnosis of gastritis and gastropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Gastritis and duodenitis are common but, in actuality, rarely lead to significant UGIB (note that they are, in fact, often identified at the time of endoscopy and may be commented on). Such commonly identified trivial endoscopic abnormalities are typically not the cause of (significant) UGIB in the absence of other factors such as anticoagulation or a coagulopathy. A careful examination for commonly missed lesions is essential in patients with clinically significant blood loss in whom the endoscopic examination reveals only gastritis or duodenitis. The examination should include careful inspection for ulcers in unusual places, varices, and Dieulafoy's lesions, all of which may be difficult to identify. </p><p>A multitude of disorders and exposures are associated with gastritis and duodenitis. Many of the associated disorders or exposures are also risk factors for peptic ulcer disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-upper-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>] (see <a href=\"#H78371796\" class=\"local\">'Peptic ulcer disease'</a> above). Other risk factors include excessive alcohol consumption, radiation injury, obesity surgery, and chronic bile reflux. Gastritis may also be found in certain autoimmune diseases. Bleeding in patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">gastritis/gastropathy</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">duodenitis/duodenopathy</span> is more common in the setting of anticoagulant use. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-diagnosis-of-gastritis-and-gastropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and diagnosis of gastritis and gastropathy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-and-chronic-gastritis-due-to-helicobacter-pylori\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute and chronic gastritis due to Helicobacter pylori&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The differential diagnosis of acute gastritis includes gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE) and, in particular, portal hypertensive gastropathy (PHG). PHG should be suspected in patients with cirrhosis with or without overt evidence of portal hypertension, in patients with proximal greater than distal gastric involvement, and in patients with concomitant varices. GAVE typically has a unique endoscopic appearance with linear aggregates of petechiae in the antrum, giving the antral area the appearance of a watermelon rind. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=portal-hypertensive-gastropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Portal hypertensive gastropathy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H78376125\" class=\"local\">'Gastric antral vascular ectasia'</a> below.)</p><p>The diagnosis of gastritis and duodenitis is made almost exclusively by endoscopic evaluation of the mucosa. Although typically not necessary in the setting of acute bleeding, the diagnosis can be confirmed by histologic evaluation. Histologic findings can vary over a wide spectrum, ranging from epithelial hyperplasia to extensive epithelial cell damage with infiltration by inflammatory cells. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-diagnosis-of-gastritis-and-gastropathy#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and diagnosis of gastritis and gastropathy&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Bleeding from gastritis or duodenitis is typically self-limited. Treatment includes removing the causative agent, a limited course of acid suppression with a proton pump inhibitor, withholding anticoagulants when they may be contributing (if possible), and, if bleeding is severe, endoscopic therapy with modalities such as argon plasma coagulation.

However, it should be kept in mind that patients with portal hypertension can develop UGIB from sources unrelated to portal hypertension (eg, peptic ulcer disease). In one study, approximately 40 percent of patients with cirrhosis and UGIB had a cause unrelated to portal hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-upper-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>While most patients with portal hypertension have cirrhosis, portal hypertension can also occur in the absence of cirrhosis, a condition referred to as &quot;noncirrhotic portal hypertension.&quot; Causes of noncirrhotic portal hypertension include portal vein thrombosis, schistosomiasis, and idiopathic noncirrhotic portal hypertension. Additionally, portal hypertension and associated variceal bleeding can occur as a result of thrombosis of mesenteric vessels.

The onset of UGIB from varices usually signifies significant portal hypertension, which is typically associated with advanced liver disease (Child-Pugh class B or C).

When PHG is the sole cause of bleeding, there is diffuse mucosal oozing with no other lesions, such as varices, to account for the GI bleeding and anemia. The mucosa is friable, and bleeding presumably occurs when the ectatic vessels rupture. The severity of gastropathy is related to the level of portal pressure, the level of hepatic vascular resistance, and the degree of reduction in hepatic blood flow. PHG, which most often causes occult bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-upper-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>], is discussed in detail elsewhere.

The submucosal artery does not undergo normal branching within the wall of the stomach. As a result, the caliber of the artery is in the range of 1 to 3 mm, approximately 10 times the normal caliber of mucosal capillaries. Dieulafoy's lesions are usually located in the proximal stomach along the lesser curvature, near the esophagogastric junction (typically within 5 cm), although they have been found in all areas of the GI tract, including the esophagus, duodenum, and colon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-upper-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults/abstract/9,47-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,47-50</a>].</p><p>The etiology of Dieulafoy's lesion is unknown. Additionally, events triggering bleeding are not well understood. Patients who bleed from Dieulafoy's lesions are typically men with comorbidities including cardiovascular disease, hypertension, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, or alcohol abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-upper-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. The use of NSAIDS is also common among patients with Dieulafoy's lesions; one theory is that NSAIDS incite bleeding by causing mucosal atrophy and ischemic injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-upper-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Bleeding episodes are often self-limited, although bleeding is usually recurrent and can be profuse.</p><p>Endoscopy is the diagnostic modality of choice to detect a Dieulafoy's lesion and is particularly helpful when performed during acute bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-upper-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>]. This is because active arterial pumping may be visualized in an area without an associated ulcer or mass lesion. In the absence of active bleeding, a Dieulafoy's lesion may appear as a raised nipple or visible vessel without an associated ulcer; however, the aberrant vessel may not be seen unless there is active bleeding from the site. Because a Dieulafoy's lesion can be difficult to identify, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of bleeding without a clear source. Endoscopic ultrasonography may be useful in confirming the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-upper-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].

However, endoscopic band ligation should be used with caution in this setting because it has been associated with perforation (especially when performed where the gastric wall is thin, such as the fundus) and bleeding from the resulting ulcer once the band falls off; a fatality from such an ulcer has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-upper-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults/abstract/53,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,56</a>].

There is no further risk of rebleeding from a Dieulafoy's lesion after surgical wedge resection.
