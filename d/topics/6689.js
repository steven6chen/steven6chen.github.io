Many of these injuries are preventable. The injuries that result in the loss of permanent teeth may have long-lasting cosmetic, functional, economic, and psychosocial effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-dental-injuries-in-children/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>]. The outcome for a number of dental injuries, which may be uncertain until the permanent dentition is established, is improved by prompt, appropriate treatment and referral.</p><p>This topic will cover injuries of the teeth. The anatomy and development of the teeth; intra-oral, lip, and tongue lacerations; and the assessment and management of jaw injuries are discussed separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anatomy-and-development-of-the-teeth\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anatomy and development of the teeth&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-and-management-of-intra-oral-lacerations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment and management of intra-oral lacerations&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-and-management-of-lip-lacerations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment and management of lip lacerations&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-repair-of-tongue-lacerations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and repair of tongue lacerations&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=jaw-fractures-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Jaw fractures in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-facial-trauma-in-adults#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of facial trauma in adults&quot;, section on 'Mandibular injury'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An estimated 30 percent of preschool children suffer injuries to the primary dentition; the prevalence is equal between boys and girls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-dental-injuries-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. By contrast, dental trauma to the permanent dentition in school-age children is twice as common in boys as in girls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-dental-injuries-in-children/abstract/2,6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6-8</a>]. These figures underestimate the occurrence of dental trauma because apparently minor trauma is underreported. Thus, a safe assumption is that up to 50 percent of children will sustain a dental injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-dental-injuries-in-children/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Dental trauma must not be overlooked as a marker for child abuse. Orofacial injury occurs in as many as 75 percent of abused children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-dental-injuries-in-children/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. </p><p>The most commonly injured teeth are the maxillary central incisors, followed by the maxillary lateral incisors and the mandibular incisors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-dental-injuries-in-children/abstract/2,14-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,14-19</a>]. The ability of the upper lip to protect the maxillary teeth is affected by the degree of prominence of the anterior teeth. The normal horizontal distance between the maxillary and mandibular incisors (overjet) is between 1 and 3 mm. Overjets greater than 4 mm increase the likelihood of dental trauma by two to three times (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F62838\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62838 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-dental-injuries-in-children/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p>Additional risk factors for dental trauma include mobility problems, physical disabilities (eg, cerebral palsy, seizure disorders) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-dental-injuries-in-children/abstract/15,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,22</a>], and the use of fixed orthodontic appliances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-dental-injuries-in-children/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

The prognosis for survival of the tooth in untreated luxation injuries to the periodontal ligament is poor. Necrotic, infected pulp tissue in the root canal may activate an inflammatory resorptive process that destroys the root in a matter of weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-and-management-of-dental-injuries-in-children/abstract/42,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,62</a>].</p><p>Another complication of dental trauma to the permanent dentition is devitalization of the dental pulp. Even minor blows may disrupt the thin strand of pulp tissue at the root apex, which is the only neurovascular supply to the permanent teeth. Ischemic necrosis of the pulp, caused by disruption of the neurovascular supply, may be indicated by an abscess in the oral vestibule opposite the tooth root (parulis) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> by color change in the tooth crown (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F65780\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65780 \">picture 10</a>).
