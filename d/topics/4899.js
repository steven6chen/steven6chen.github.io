In our opinion, early pregnancy loss, especially when recurrent, is an emotionally traumatic experience, similar to that associated with stillbirth or neonatal death.</p><p>Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) is one of the most frustrating and difficult areas in reproductive medicine because the etiology is often unknown and there are few evidence-based diagnostic and treatment strategies. Studies on the etiology, evaluation, and management of RPL are often flawed. Common methodologic weaknesses include failure to adhere to generally accepted criteria for RPL, ascertainment bias, improper selection of controls, uneven monitoring of cohorts, no exclusion of aneuploid fetuses, lack of stratification for important factors such as number of previous losses, premature termination of study after interim analysis, and excessive postrandomization patient withdrawal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-etiology-of-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The definition of RPL varies, which makes studying the phenomenon, and determining which couples to counsel or treat, more challenging. As examples, varying definitions have included:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two or more failed clinical pregnancies as documented by ultrasonography or histopathologic examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-etiology-of-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Three consecutive pregnancy losses, which are not required to be intrauterine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-etiology-of-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. </p><p/><p>In our practice, we start investigating after two failed clinical pregnancies, including biochemical pregnancies for women undergoing IVF. The rationale for including biochemical pregnancies and non-visualized pregnancies (ectopic pregnancies) in the definition of RPL comes from a retrospective cohort study of 587 women who had three or more consecutive pregnancy losses before 12 weeks gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-etiology-of-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Non-visualized pregnancy losses (biochemical pregnancy losses <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pregnancies of unknown location) had the same negative impact on future live birth as an intrauterine pregnancy losses. </p><p>In response to these varied definitions, the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology released a 2014 consensus statement proposing that RPL describes repeated pregnancy loss, regardless of anatomic location, but they did not recommend the number of losses required for the problem to be defined as recurrent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-etiology-of-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Rather, to facilitate meaningful comparisons of studies, the statement advised researchers and clinicians to clearly describe the type of pregnancy loss, gestational age, number of prior pregnancy losses, and relevant details of ultrasound measurements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-etiology-of-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>RPL can be further divided into primary or secondary processes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-etiology-of-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Primary RPL refers to pregnancy loss in women who have never carried to viability. In contrast, secondary RPL refers to pregnancy loss in a woman who has had a previous live birth. The prognosis for successful pregnancy is better with secondary RPL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-etiology-of-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>There is no specific term for describing women who have had multiple spontaneous miscarriages interspersed with normal pregnancies (ie, nonconsecutive pregnancy losses).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 15 percent of pregnant women experience sporadic loss of a clinically recognized pregnancy. Just 2 percent of pregnant women experience two consecutive pregnancy losses and only 0.4 to 1 percent have three consecutive pregnancy losses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-etiology-of-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The observed frequency of three consecutive pregnancy losses is slightly higher than that expected by chance alone: if the frequency of miscarriage is 15 percent, then the probability of three consecutive miscarriages would be (0.15)(0.15)(0.15), or 0.003 (0.3 percent). By comparison, the observed frequency of two consecutive pregnancy losses is that which would be expected by chance alone (0.15)(0.15) = 0.0225 (2.25 percent).</p><p>These mathematical relationships constitute one basis for defining the disorder, but do not take into account the effect of maternal age or the gestational age at which the miscarriage occurred (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above). The prevalence of miscarriage is higher with increasing maternal age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F70032\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70032 \">table 1</a>) and at very early gestational ages (eg, at less than 6 weeks of gestation the risk of miscarriage is 22 to 57 percent versus 15 percent at 6 to 10 weeks and 2 to 3 percent after 10 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-etiology-of-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS AND ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Couples who have had a pregnancy loss have two major concerns: the cause and the risk of recurrence. Although RPL is an important problem in women's health, there are many unsolved questions regarding etiology, evaluation, and management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-etiology-of-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Unfortunately, the cause of RPL can be determined in only 50 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-etiology-of-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. General etiological categories of RPL include anatomic, immunological, genetic, endocrine, infectious, thrombophilic, and environmental factors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Previous pregnancy loss</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a first pregnancy, the risk of miscarriage is 11 to 13 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-etiology-of-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. After one miscarriage, this rate rises slightly to 14 to 21 percent. After two or three miscarriages, the rate is 24 to 29 percent and 31 to 33 percent, respectively. However, several factors influence these rates:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The cause of the pregnancy loss impacts the miscarriage risk. As an example, carriers of a 22:22 translocation will almost always miscarry, whereas women with 13:14 translocation have a 25 percent risk.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The gestational age of prior pregnancy loss and interpregnancy interval (IPI) may impact the risk of repeat pregnancy loss. In a secondary analysis of 677 women with a prior pregnancy loss (mean gestational age 8.6&plusmn;2 weeks), the IPI after a first-trimester loss did not impact the live birth rate in a subsequent pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-etiology-of-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, in a study of women with pregnancy loss between 14 and 19 weeks of gestation (that adjusted for maternal age), an IPI &le;3 months was associated with an increased rate of recurrent loss compared with an IPI of &gt;9 to 12 months (22 versus 11 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-etiology-of-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Advancing maternal age is associated with a higher rate of pregnancy loss of both normal and abnormal conceptuses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-etiology-of-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. This probably reflects poor oocyte quality in this age group. The increased risk of miscarriage with advancing age was illustrated in a review of over 1 million pregnancies with known outcome and with admission to a hospital [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-etiology-of-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The overall rate of spontaneous pregnancy loss was 11 percent. The approximate rates of clinically recognized miscarriage according to maternal age were: age 20 to 30 years (9 to 17 percent), age 35 (20 percent), age 40 (40 percent), and age 45 (80 percent). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=effects-of-advanced-maternal-age-on-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Effects of advanced maternal age on pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increasing parity is also associated with an increased rate of miscarriage. This may be partially explained by the correlation between maternal age and parity and by &quot;reproductive compensation&quot; (ie, a behavior pattern in which couples make repetitive attempts to bear children after miscarriage).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Previous pregnancy outcome can positively or negatively affect the risk in the next pregnancy. It is generally agreed that the risk of miscarriage increases with each successive pregnancy loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-etiology-of-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/17,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,19,20</a>], whereas some studies report a pregnancy ending in live birth reduces the risk of miscarriage in the subsequent gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-etiology-of-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gestational age at the time of pregnancy loss should be considered in determining both the etiology and risk of recurrence. RPL typically occurs at a similar gestational age in consecutive pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-etiology-of-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The recurrence risk increases as gestational age at the time of loss increases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-etiology-of-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Uterine factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acquired and congenital uterine abnormalities are responsible for 10 to 50 percent of RPL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-etiology-of-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Anomalies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Congenital uterine anomalies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F81036\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81036 \">figure 1</a>) are present in 10 to 15 percent of women with RPL versus 7 percent of all women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-etiology-of-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. Pregnancy loss may be related to impaired uterine distention or abnormal implantation due to decreased vascularity in a septum, increased inflammation, or reduction in sensitivity to steroid hormones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-etiology-of-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>The septate uterus is the uterine anomaly associated with the poorest reproductive outcome and the most common uterine abnormality associated with RPL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-etiology-of-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. The fetal survival rate in women with untreated septate uterus is 6 to 28 percent and the miscarriage rate is greater than 60 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-etiology-of-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/23,28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,28-30</a>]. The longer the septum, the worse the prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-etiology-of-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. However, data on the pregnancy effects of reproductive tract anomalies have been derived from relatively small observational studies that are subject to ascertainment biases.</p><p>The mechanism by which a septate uterus causes pregnancy loss is not clearly understood, but poor blood supply to the septum leading to poor implantation is one possibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-etiology-of-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

The main cause of intrauterine adhesions is curettage for pregnancy complications. Curettage of the endometrium, especially within the first four weeks postpartum, traumatizes the basalis layer, which then heals via formation of granulation tissue. Granulating tissue on opposing surfaces of the uterus can eventually fuse and produce tissue bridges, ranging from filmy adhesions composed of endometrial tissue to dense adhesions consisting entirely of connective tissue. The resulting adherence of the uterine walls, with partial or complete obliteration of the uterine cavity, leads to menstrual irregularities (hypomenorrhea, amenorrhea), cyclic pelvic pain, infertility, and RPL.

Normal endometrial receptivity allows embryo attachment, implantation, invasion, and development of the placenta. These processes are likely to be disturbed when endometrial receptivity is defective, resulting in unexplained infertility and RPL. Causes of defective endometrial receptivity and biomarkers for evaluation of endometrial receptivity are under investigation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-etiology-of-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. One example is a primary endometrial receptor defect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-etiology-of-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Additional research suggests that RPL is associated with uterine stem cell deficiency and enhanced cellular senescence, which then results in abnormal endometrial preparation for pregnancy that leads to recurrent loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-etiology-of-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

Both autoimmune and alloimmune mechanisms have been proposed. Since the mechanisms that allow a mother to tolerate her semi-allogeneic conceptus are not well defined, it is difficult to assess the role of aberrant immunologic factors in reproductive failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-etiology-of-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

If the blastocyst is developmentally normal and intact, the embryo should be entirely protected by trophoblast cells. However, in some pregnancies, the blastocyst is genetically deformed and not fully intact. As a result, paternally-derived antigens are exposed to the maternal immune system, which leads to a graft rejection response. A secondary immune response would be expected to cause early rejection in cases of recurrent spontaneous abortion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunology-of-the-maternal-fetal-interface\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunology of the maternal-fetal interface&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Alternatively, some mothers with RPL may lack essential components of the networks that provide immunological protection to the embryos, such as appropriate expression of complement regulatory proteins (eg, mannose-binding lectin, apoptosis-inducing TNF superfamily members, macrophage inhibitory cytokine 1, <span class=\"nowrap\">Th1/Th2/Th3-type</span> cytokines, and HLA-DR, HLA-G or HLA-E) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-etiology-of-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/40-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-45</a>]. Dysregulation of the normal immune mechanism probably operates at the maternal-fetal interface and may involve increased activity of uterine natural killer (uNK) cells, which appear to regulate placental and trophoblast growth, local immunomodulation, and control of trophoblast invasion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definition-and-etiology-of-recurrent-pregnancy-loss/abstract/46-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-48</a>].
