These rare disorders may produce familial or sporadic lung disease, with clinical presentations ranging from neonatal respiratory failure to childhood- or adult-onset interstitial lung disease. An overview of these disorders is presented in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71981\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71981 \">table 1</a>). </p><p>Interstitial lung diseases in children were initially categorized by their histologic appearance in a manner similar to that used for adult forms of interstitial lung disease (ILD). In children, the lung histopathology findings associated with desquamative interstitial pneumonitis (DIP) are now known to often result from genetic mechanisms that disrupt normal surfactant production and metabolism. By contrast, DIP in adults is considered to represent a distinct type of ILD, which is strongly associated with cigarette smoking and carries a relatively favorable prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-surfactant-dysfunction/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. These genetic disorders also result in histopathologic patterns other than DIP, including findings of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis and chronic pneumonitis of infancy. An understanding of the pathogenesis of these disorders permits a mechanistic classification as genetic surfactant dysfunction disorders instead of their previous classification based upon histologic appearance. </p><p>Issues related to genetic disorders of surfactant dysfunction will be reviewed here. The classification and description of other interstitial lung diseases in children are discussed separately. As these disorders involve more than just the pulmonary interstitium, they are more accurately referred to as diffuse lung diseases (DLD). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-diffuse-lung-disease-interstitial-lung-disease-in-infants-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of diffuse lung disease (interstitial lung disease) in infants and children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11110473\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY AND GENETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pulmonary surfactant is a mixture of lipids and proteins that is produced by alveolar type II epithelial cells (AEC2) and secreted into the airspaces. Phospholipids are the major component of surfactant by weight, and are essential for lowering surface tension at the air-liquid interface, which prevents alveolar collapse at end-expiration. </p><p>Four proteins highly expressed in the lung and found in surfactant are designated surfactant proteins (SP) A, B, C, and D. Additional proteins including ABCA3 (member A3 of the ATP binding cassette family of proteins) and TTF-1 (thyroid transcription factor 1) are also important for the production of functional surfactant. The surfactant proteins are developmentally regulated, such that their expression increases in later gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-surfactant-dysfunction/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SP-B and SP-C are low molecular weight, very hydrophobic proteins that interact with the lipid components and are important for the surface tension lowering properties of surfactant. SP-B is encoded by a single gene (<em>SFTPB</em>) on human chromosome 2. Proteolytic cleavage of a larger precursor protein (proSP-B) yields the 79 amino acid mature SP-B protein found in the airspaces. SP-C is among the most hydrophobic of all proteins in the human proteome, encoded by a single gene (<em>SFTPC</em>) on human chromosome 8. Proteolytic cleavage of a proprotein (proSP-C) yields the 35 amino acid mature SP-C. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SP-A and SP-D are larger, structurally-related hydrophilic glycoproteins that have important roles in innate immunity of the lung.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ABCA3 is a transmembrane protein found on the limiting membrane of lamellar bodies, the lysosomally-derived organelles in which surfactant is assembled and stored within the type II pneumocytes prior to secretion. It is encoded by a single gene (<em>ABCA3</em>) on human chromosome 16 and the 1704 amino-acid protein contains two transmembrane domains and two nucleotide-binding domains. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TF-1, encoded by the gene <em>NKX2.1,</em> is a member of the homeodomain family of transcription factors and binds to specific sequences in the genes encoding ABCA3, SP-B, and SP-C to regulate their expression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-surfactant-dysfunction/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. <em>NKX2.1</em> is a relatively small gene on human chromosome 14.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11110481\"><span class=\"h2\">SFTPB mutations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most disease-causing mutations in <em>SFTPB</em> result in a complete lack of mature SP-B protein (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim/265120&amp;token=ODIqmPyH03K5IrNHL4ootvp3ssM86wOnxIOFqyKtC9Pow+wcJEv7s3zL5yJkteEB&amp;TOPIC_ID=14371\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">MIM #265120</a>). Lung disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, requiring mutations in both alleles. Surfactant produced by infants with SP-B deficiency is abnormal in composition and does not function normally in lowering surface tension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-surfactant-dysfunction/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Surfactant from SP-B deficient infants is also lacking in mature SP-C due to incomplete processing of proSP-C, which further diminishes its effectiveness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-surfactant-dysfunction/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The most common <em>SFTPB</em> mutation, c.397delCinsGAA (formerly called 121ins2), involves a net insertion of two base pairs that results in a frameshift and premature codon for the termination of translation, and unstable transcript. Many other mutations, including a deletion spanning two exons, have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-surfactant-dysfunction/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>]. A few mutations have been identified that result in production of reduced amounts of SP-B [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-surfactant-dysfunction/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. These mutations causing &quot;partial deficiency&quot; are rare. </p><p>SP-B deficiency has a predicted disease incidence of &lt;1 in 1,000,000 live births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-surfactant-dysfunction/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The most frequently encountered <em>SFTPB</em> mutation, 121ins2, has accounted for over one-half of the mutant <em>SFTPB</em> alleles identified to date [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-surfactant-dysfunction/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. It occurs primarily in individuals of northern European descent, probably due to a common ancestral origin. In samples from populations in the United States and Norway, the frequency of the <em>SFTPB</em> c.397delCinsGAA (121ins2) mutation was approximately 0.1 percent; the mutation was not found in samples from either Korea or South Africa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-surfactant-dysfunction/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11110496\"><span class=\"h2\">SFTPC mutations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Familial cases of SP-C dysfunction (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim/610913&amp;token=ODIqmPyH03K5IrNHL4ootvp3ssM86wOnxIOFqyKtC9OA9JOusUsu473wvk1gwGyY&amp;TOPIC_ID=14371\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">MIM #610913</a>) are generally inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, although the onset and severity of lung disease are highly variable, even within the same family (see <a href=\"#H16526774\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> below). Germline <em>SFTPC</em> mutations may also arise de novo and cause sporadic lung disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-surfactant-dysfunction/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. </p><p>Population-based estimates of SP-C-related lung disease are not available. The most commonly identified <em>SFTPC</em> mutation, p.Ile73Thr (or c.218 T&gt;C), has been observed in approximately one-third to one-half of all reported cases of SP-C dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-surfactant-dysfunction/abstract/20-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-24</a>]. This mutation was not found in 4500 samples obtained from a neonatal screening program in the United States, consistent with the rarity of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-surfactant-dysfunction/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The majority of other known <em>SFTPC</em> mutations have been unique to a given kindred and located in the carboxy-terminal domain of proSP-C in a region homologous to other proteins involved in conformational disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-surfactant-dysfunction/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p>All known disease-causing <em>SFTPC</em> mutations are predicted to result in the production of abnormal proSP-C, which is thought to fold incorrectly. How these mutations produce disease is not well understood. Misfolded proSP-C may elicit the unfolded protein response, resulting in inflammation and AEC2 apoptosis via a toxic-gain-of-function mechanism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-surfactant-dysfunction/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. Alternatively, because proSP-C self-associates in the secretory pathway, misfolded proSP-C that is targeted for degradation may also cause wild type proSP-C to be degraded in a dominant negative mechanism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-surfactant-dysfunction/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>]. Finally, mutations may cause proSP-C to be misrouted in the cell, leading to accumulation in the endosomal pathway and interfering with autophagy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-surfactant-dysfunction/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11110552\"><span class=\"h2\">ABCA3 mutations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mutations in <em>ABCA3</em> appear to be the most common cause of genetic surfactant dysfunction in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-surfactant-dysfunction/abstract/20,31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,31-33</a>]. The mutations result in a loss of or reduced function of the ABCA3 protein, and are inherited in an autosomal recessive manner (<a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/omim/610921&amp;token=ODIqmPyH03K5IrNHL4ootvp3ssM86wOnxIOFqyKtC9PS2aVMnyL5BI6HZVWJckbO&amp;TOPIC_ID=14371\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">MIM #610921</a>). Absent or decreased protein expression, abnormal trafficking (Type 1 mutation), and diminished functional activity of ABCA3 protein (Type 2 mutation) have all been implicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-surfactant-dysfunction/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>]. The severe neonatal form of the disease is thought to result from a lack of functional surfactant, a hypothesis that is supported by data from both animal and human studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-surfactant-dysfunction/abstract/37-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-40</a>].</p><p>Lack of ABCA3 function has a variety of effects. Impaired phospholipid uptake was observed in cultured cells that expressed <em>ABCA3</em> mutations identified in human infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-surfactant-dysfunction/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Reduced amounts of mature SP-C and altered processing of proSP-B to SP-B have also been observed in humans with <em>ABCA3</em> mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-surfactant-dysfunction/abstract/34,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,42</a>]. Mice engineered to be deficient in ABCA3 had abnormal lamellar body (LB) formation, aberrant SP-B processing, altered lung development late in gestation, and died shortly after birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-surfactant-dysfunction/abstract/37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-39</a>].</p><p>Disease caused by <em>ABCA3</em> mutations varies in its presentation and severity, depending in part on the genotype, as shown in a series of 185 individuals with various <em>ABCA3</em> mutations. The most severe phenotype (respiratory failure at birth, leading to death or lung transplantation by one year of age) was found in 100 percent of those with mutations predicted to preclude ABCA3 expression on both alleles <span class=\"nowrap\">(null/null),</span> as compared with 75 percent of those with genotypes of either <span class=\"nowrap\">null/other</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">other/other</span> mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-surfactant-dysfunction/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. However, discordant outcomes have been reported in siblings with the same <em>ABCA3</em> genotype, suggesting that factors other than genotype contribute to disease severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-surfactant-dysfunction/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. </p><p>Surfactant isolated from infants with severe ABCA3-related disease has decreased amounts of critical lipid components as well as impaired surface-tension lowering properties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-surfactant-dysfunction/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. It is not known whether the milder disease seen in older children results from chronic surfactant deficiency or other mechanisms. In vitro studies of one mutation associated with interstitial lung disease in older children (p.Glu292Val) revealed less severely impaired ability to transport lipids transport compared with mutations associated with more severe disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-surfactant-dysfunction/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H16526774\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> below.)</p><p>Most mutations in <em>ABCA3</em> are unique to a given kindred, with over 150 different variants reported in the literature to date [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-surfactant-dysfunction/abstract/31,32,34,40,42,47-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32,34,40,42,47-57</a>]. The most common mutation is p.Glu292Val (or p.E292V, c.875 A&gt;T), which has been identified in multiple unrelated individuals with relatively mild disease, but has accounted for less than 10 percent of identified mutant ABCA3 alleles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-surfactant-dysfunction/abstract/17,42,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,42,47</a>]. In samples from populations in the United States and Norway, the frequency of the p.Glu292Val mutation was approximately 0.4 percent; this mutation was not found in samples from either Korea or South Africa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-surfactant-dysfunction/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The overall carrier frequency in the population for a deleterious <em>ABCA3 </em>mutation has been estimated to be between 1 in 33 to 1 in 70 individuals, predicting a disease incidence of between 1 in ~4,400 to 1 in ~20,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-surfactant-dysfunction/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11110608\"><span class=\"h2\">NKX2.1 mutations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>NKX2.1</em> encodes TTF-1, which plays an important role in SP-B, SP-C, and <em>ABCA3</em> expression. Reduced amounts of one or more of these proteins due to mutations or gene deletions which inactivate one <em>NKX2.1</em> allele (haploinsufficiency) is the presumed mechanism for surfactant dysfunction and lung disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-surfactant-dysfunction/abstract/59-69\" class=\"abstract_t\">59-69</a>]. </p><p>No epidemiological estimates are currently available for <em>NKX2.1</em> haploinsufficiency. Nearly all <em>NKX2.1</em> mutations described to date have been unique to a given kindred, precluding screening for a predominant mutation to estimate the frequency of this disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-surfactant-dysfunction/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. The majority of reported variants have occurred de novo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-surfactant-dysfunction/abstract/65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,66</a>], but autosomal dominant inheritance has been observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-surfactant-dysfunction/abstract/64,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,70</a>].</p><p>In addition to neonatal lung disease, mutations in <em>NKX2.1</em> can present with interstitial lung disease, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> neurologic abnormalities or hypothyroidism. The neurologic manifestations may include hypotonia, developmental delay, chorea, or seizures. In a case series of 21 patients with <em>NKX2.1</em> mutations, 76 percent presented with neonatal lung disease, and 19 percent presented with interstitial lung disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-surfactant-dysfunction/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. More than half of the patients had or ultimately developed the triad of pulmonary, neurologic, and thyroid disease (sometimes known as brain-lung-thyroid syndrome, <a href=\"http://omim.org/entry/610978&amp;token=O25AxH2ZrpTPG8o+GEGTWKnkUfQIhfLL0MhC1SXbX5ZbTkyr+nqYLzEpy/FlK+CS&amp;TOPIC_ID=14371\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">MIM #610978</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-detection-of-congenital-hypothyroidism#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and detection of congenital hypothyroidism&quot;, section on 'Thyroid dysgenesis'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16526767\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTOPATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several different patterns may be seen on histopathological examination of lung tissue from patients with surfactant dysfunction. The findings on routine histopathology may be suggestive for one of these disorders, but do not distinguish among the different genetic causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-surfactant-dysfunction/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. Common characteristic features include interstitial widening, foamy alveolar macrophages in the airspaces, hyperplasia of the type 2 alveolar epithelial cells (AEC2), and variable amounts of granular, proteinaceous material in the distal airspaces, known as pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-surfactant-dysfunction/abstract/10,20,31,72-74\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,20,31,72-74</a>]. The proteinosis may be very subtle or absent. Other findings may include non-specific changes of lung injury due to mechanical ventilation and hyperoxia. Review by a pathologist with special expertise in childhood interstitial lung disease (ILD) and the findings associated with genetic surfactant dysfunction may be helpful. </p><p>Chronic pneumonitis of infancy (CPI) was the most common pattern seen in children under two years old with symptomatic lung disease due to <em>SFTPC</em> mutations in a multicenter review of lung biopsy samples [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-surfactant-dysfunction/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. The predominant patterns observed in patients with <em>ABCA3</em> mutations were PAP, desquamative interstitial pneumonitis (DIP), and non-specific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP). A PAP picture was seen mainly in younger children with symptomatic disease due to <em>ABCA3</em> mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-surfactant-dysfunction/abstract/71,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">71,75</a>], while DIP was more commonly seen in older children with ILD due to <em>ABCA3</em> mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-surfactant-dysfunction/abstract/42,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,47</a>]. Usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP), the most common frequent histological pattern seen in adults with ILD, has been reported in 15-year-old with <em>ABCA3</em> mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-surfactant-dysfunction/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Specialized immunohistochemical studies may provide additional useful information, but are currently available only in research laboratories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-surfactant-dysfunction/abstract/10,34,42,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,34,42,76</a>]. The differential diagnosis and treatment of infants and children with PAP is discussed in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-alveolar-proteinosis-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis in children&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Electron microscopy may be used to help distinguish among the genetic causes of surfactant dysfunction. In individuals with <em>ACBA3</em> and <em>SFTPB</em> mutations, electron microscopic examination of AEC2s demonstrates abnormal structure of the lamellar bodies (LBs), which are the organelles in which surfactant is stored [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-surfactant-dysfunction/abstract/31,34,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,34,48</a>]. In children with ABCA3-related disease, LBs appear small and dense, with eccentrically-placed inclusions. Composite LBs formed by fusion of two or more LBs may also be seen, while some LBs appear normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-surfactant-dysfunction/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. By contrast, LBs in children with <em>SFTPB</em> mutations appear disorganized and poorly lamellated, with vesicular inclusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-surfactant-dysfunction/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Abnormal LBs also have been described in patients with <em>SFTPC</em> mutations, although this is not a consistent feature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-surfactant-dysfunction/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. Lung biopsy specimens should be properly handled at the time of initial processing in order to allow for electron microscopy studies and maximize diagnostic yield [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-surfactant-dysfunction/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>].</p><p>Lung pathology findings from patients with NKX2.1 haploinsufficiency have been infrequently reported, and included deficient alveolarization, septal fibrosis, and lung cysts, with numerous LBs visualized by light microscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-surfactant-dysfunction/abstract/6,66,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,66,68</a>]. Decreased staining for ABCA3 and SP-A protein was also noted in a single patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-surfactant-dysfunction/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16526774\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mutations in <em>SFTPB</em> cause pulmonary disease due to production of insufficient amounts of or abnormal surfactant, resulting in lungs that are poorly compliant and prone to atelectasis. The early clinical picture may be similar to that of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) of the newborn, which is caused by insufficient surfactant production in preterm neonates due to pulmonary immaturity (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-respiratory-distress-syndrome-in-the-newborn\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of respiratory distress syndrome in the newborn&quot;</a>). Premature infants with RDS generally improve in response to treatment with exogenous surfactant and also improve as they mature and become able to produce their own surfactant. By contrast, infants with genetic surfactant dysfunction remain symptomatic because they are unable to produce normal surfactant and their AEC2 function remains abnormal. The clinical presentation of surfactant dysfunction may also resemble persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=persistent-pulmonary-hypertension-of-the-newborn\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn&quot;</a>), and the distinction becomes apparent if the infant does not respond to standard therapies for PPHN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-surfactant-dysfunction/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. The majority of patients with <em>SFTPB</em> mutations progress to fatal respiratory failure within days of birth to three to six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-surfactant-dysfunction/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], although rare children with milder lung disease associated with mutations that result in partial SP-B deficiency have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-surfactant-dysfunction/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. </p><p>Surfactant dysfunction due to mutations in <em>ABCA3</em> has a more variable phenotype, depending in part on the genotype (see <a href=\"#H11110552\" class=\"local\">'ABCA3 mutations'</a> above). The initial presentation may be identical to that of SP-B deficient infants, with a severe RDS-picture in a full-term neonate. Many affected infants have progressive disease that leads to early death, while other infants may stabilize or improve.

The interpretation of genetic studies may not be straight-forward, particularly if variants are identified that alter the coding sequence but whose clinical significance is unknown; these are termed variants of uncertain significance, or VUS. A number of laboratories offer panels that test multiple genes, which can be more cost effective as well as sensitive to small duplications or deletions. However, testing of additional genes may also uncover VUS in genes likely unrelated to the child's presentation, further complicating interpretation.

While <em>SFTPB</em> mutations are associated with nearly 100 percent mortality without lung transplantation, <em>ABCA3</em> and <em>SFTPC</em> mutations may be associated with less severe disease and prolonged survival. Additionally, identification of causative mutations also allows families to be informed about risk of recurrence with future pregnancies and allow for prenatal diagnosis. Testing of the proband's parents can provide important information. It can inform whether mutations identified in the proband are on opposite alleles (<em>in</em> <em>trans</em>) versus on the same allele (<em>in</em> <em>cis</em>), or possibly arose <em>de novo</em>, as these findings have different implications for diagnosis and reproductive decision-making [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-surfactant-dysfunction/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. </p><p>The predictive value of genetic testing is limited, probably because of the effects of environmental, genetic, and epigenetic modifiers.

No data are currently available on the prevalence of these disorders.</p><p>Mutations in the genes encoding the components of the receptor for Granulocyte-Macrophage Colony Stimulating Factor (GM-SCF) have been shown to be a cause of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-surfactant-dysfunction/abstract/110-114\" class=\"abstract_t\">110-114</a>]. Because alveolar macrophages are involved in the uptake and recycling of surfactant components, mutations in the GM-CSF receptor are thought to lead to PAP by preventing the clearing of surfactant materials and resulting in their accumulation in the alveolar air spaces. This form of PAP can thus be considered a genetic disorder of surfactant catabolism. Additional genetic causes of PAP in children have been identified, including mutations in the gene <em>SLC7A7</em> that results in the disorder lysinuric protein intolerance, mutations in the gene encoding methionyl tRNA synthetase (<em>MARS</em>), and mutations in the transcription factor GATA2. Because these genes are expressed in tissues other than the lung, infants with by these disorders manifest symptoms related to other organ systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-surfactant-dysfunction/abstract/115\" class=\"abstract_t\">115</a>]. PAP in adults is usually caused by an auto-immune process due to neutralizing auto-antibodies directed against GM-CSF. This mechanism of PAP is rare in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-surfactant-dysfunction/abstract/116\" class=\"abstract_t\">116</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-alveolar-proteinosis-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-alveolar-proteinosis-in-children#H19978715\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary alveolar proteinosis in children&quot;, section on 'GM-CSF receptor'</a>.)</p><p>Mutations in <em>SFTPA1</em> and <em>SFTPA2</em>, the two genes encoding mature SP-A, have been reported in association with adult-onset pulmonary fibrosis and lung carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-surfactant-dysfunction/abstract/117-119\" class=\"abstract_t\">117-119</a>]. <em>SFTPA1</em> or <em>SFTPA2</em> mutations have yet to be identified as a cause of childhood-onset lung disease. Similarly, common <em>SFTPD</em> variants have been associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-surfactant-dysfunction/abstract/120\" class=\"abstract_t\">120</a>]. However, in a study of 73 children with idiopathic interstitial lung disease, no <em>SFTPD</em> disease-causing mutations were identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetic-disorders-of-surfactant-dysfunction/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8900947\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genetic surfactant dysfunction disorders are caused by deleterious mutations in genes responsible for the production and function of pulmonary surfactant. These disorders are rare, and may produce familial or sporadic lung disease with clinical presentations ranging from neonatal respiratory failure to childhood- and adult-onset interstitial lung disease. An overview of these disorders is presented in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71981\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71981 \">table 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most disease-causing mutations in <em>SFTPB</em> result in a complete lack of mature surfactant B protein. Affected individuals present with respiratory distress during the neonatal period and progress to fatal respiratory failure within three to six months. The early clinical picture may resemble respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) or persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN). (See <a href=\"#H11110481\" class=\"local\">'SFTPB mutations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H16526774\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disease-causing mutations in <em>SFTPC</em> result in the production of an abnormal form of the precursor for mature surfactant protein C. The related lung disease has a highly variable age of onset and clinical course, even within the same family. Affected individuals may present during early infancy, or remain asymptomatic well into adult life. The most common clinical features noted at presentation in children were cough, tachypnea, and hypoxemia. (See <a href=\"#H11110496\" class=\"local\">'SFTPC mutations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H16526774\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surfactant dysfunction due to mutations in <em>ABCA3</em> has a variable phenotype. Many affected infants may present during the neonatal period with severe progressive disease that leads to early death, while other infants may stabilize or improve. Some individuals may also present later in infancy or childhood with cough, tachypnea, hypoxemia, gastroesophageal reflux, and failure to thrive. (See <a href=\"#H11110552\" class=\"local\">'ABCA3 mutations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H16526774\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of a genetic disorder of surfactant dysfunction is suspected in an infant presenting with unexplained respiratory distress, such neonates with symptoms suggesting respiratory distress syndrome but no history of prematurity, or an older infant or child with pulmonary function testing (PFT) suggesting restrictive lung disease. The diagnosis of genetic surfactant dysfunction is supported by findings of ground-glass opacifications of the alveolar spaces and thickening of the interstitium on high-resolution computerized tomography (HRCT). It is confirmed by specific genetic testing. (See <a href=\"#H16526803\" class=\"local\">'Radiographic studies'</a> above and <a href=\"#H16526810\" class=\"local\">'Genetic testing'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lung biopsy may be indicated for diagnosis when disease is rapidly progressive and there is insufficient time needed to await the results from genetic testing, or if results of genetic testing are ambiguous or negative. (See <a href=\"#H16526817\" class=\"local\">'Lung biopsy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lung transplantation is the only definitive treatment option for most infants with <em>SFTPB</em> mutations, and for individuals with severe forms of <em>SFTPC</em> and <em>ABCA3</em>-related surfactant dysfunction. Supportive therapy, including nutritional support and mechanical ventilation if needed, is used while awaiting transplantation. (See <a href=\"#H16526846\" class=\"local\">'Lung transplantation'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exogenous surfactant may provide transient improvement in lung function for selected patients with genetic surfactant dysfunction, but it is not a viable long-term treatment option. Therapy with corticosteroids (in most cases with concomitant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">hydroxychloroquine</a>) has been used in patients with <em>ABCA3</em> and <em>SFTPC</em> mutations, but whether these treatments truly provide clinical benefit is unclear.
