Pamidronate and zoledronic acid are approved in the United States, while ibandronate is approved in many European countries. Bisphosphonates inhibit osteoclastic bone resorption by attaching to hydroxyapatite binding sites within bone. The bisphosphonate that is released during bone resorption impairs the ability of the osteoclasts to adhere to the bony surface and resorb bone. In addition, bisphosphonates also reduce osteoclast activity by decreasing osteoclast progenitor development and recruitment, and by promoting osteoclast apoptosis.

However, there are differences as well. As a fully human monoclonal antibody, denosumab is administered as a subcutaneous, rather than intravenous, injection, and its toxicity profile differs in several respects from that of bisphosphonates (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F67326\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67326 \">table 1</a>). Knowledge about the comparative side effect profiles of denosumab and bisphosphonates is primarily derived from the three large, identically-designed registration trials performed in patients with bone metastases from breast, prostate, or other solid tumors and multiple myeloma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-of-therapy-with-bone-antiresorptive-agents-in-patients-with-advanced-malignancy/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1927316\"><span class=\"h1\">RISKS SHARED BY BOTH CLASSES OF DRUGS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1928329\"><span class=\"h2\">Osteonecrosis of the jaw</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ), a form of avascular necrosis first described in 2002 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-of-therapy-with-bone-antiresorptive-agents-in-patients-with-advanced-malignancy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], is a relatively uncommon but potentially serious side effect of treatment with either intravenous (IV) high-potency bisphosphonates (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F55727\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef55727 \">image 1</a>) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=denosumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">denosumab</a>. Patients may be considered to have MRONJ if the following characteristics are present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-of-therapy-with-bone-antiresorptive-agents-in-patients-with-advanced-malignancy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Current or previous treatment with antiresorptive or antiangiogenic agents</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exposed bone or bone that can be probed through an intraoral or extraoral fistula(e) in the maxillofacial region that has persisted for more than eight weeks</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No history of radiation therapy to the jaws or obvious metastatic disease to the jaws</p><p/><p>The overall risk of this complication is &lt;2 percent in patients receiving antiresorptive agents in the first year of therapy and rises with prolonged therapy.

The risk is slightly (although not significantly) higher with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=denosumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">denosumab</a> than bisphosphonates (1.9 versus 1.3 percent in the first year in the three main registration trials) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-of-therapy-with-bone-antiresorptive-agents-in-patients-with-advanced-malignancy/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. </p><p>Among patients receiving therapy with an antiresorptive agent, dentoalveolar surgery is a major risk factor. In view of the difficulty in treating and the morbidity associated with established MRONJ, prevention is emphasized. Guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO), the American Association of Maxillofacial Surgeons (AAOMS), and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-of-therapy-with-bone-antiresorptive-agents-in-patients-with-advanced-malignancy/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>] recommend that all patients have a comprehensive dental examination and preventive dentistry (preemptive extraction of unsalvageable teeth and optimized periodontal health) before beginning therapy with an antiresorptive agent. Oral exams and hygiene status should be closely monitored by the oncologist during treatment. For patients receiving antiresorptive therapy for cancer, invasive dental procedures (including removal of teeth or placement of dental implants) should be avoided if at all possible. However, other less invasive procedures can be completed, such as dental cleaning, repair of cavities, crown placement, or root canals. If a dental extraction or other invasive procedure is absolutely essential during therapy, antiresorptive therapy should be held for 8 to 12 weeks, if possible, and restarted only after complete mucosal healing has been observed.

Treatment has generally shifted away from aggressive surgical interventions to conservative therapy with limited debridement, antibiotics, and oral rinses with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorhexidine</a> or hydrogen peroxide.

Daily supplementation with calcium and vitamin D is strongly recommended for all patients unless otherwise contraindicated (eg, in patients with hypercalcemia or a history of recurrent renal stones). Most patients should receive a total of 1000 mg of calcium (diet plus supplement) and 800 to 1200 IU of vitamin D daily. However, vitamin D dosing should be based upon serum levels, and recommendations regarding calcium supplementation should be individualized based upon the patient&rsquo;s underlying malignancy (and the risk for developing hypercalcemia) and renal function. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-d-deficiency-in-adults-definition-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vitamin D deficiency in adults: Definition, clinical manifestations, and treatment&quot;, section on 'Dosing'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-and-vitamin-d-supplementation-in-osteoporosis#H13468588\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Calcium and vitamin D supplementation in osteoporosis&quot;, section on 'Optimal intake'</a>.)</p><p>Periodic monitoring of serum calcium levels (eg, every three months) is advised during therapy with either bisphosphonates or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=denosumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">denosumab</a>. More frequent monitoring is needed in symptomatic patients and those with baseline renal insufficiency when initiating therapy.

If patients become hypercalcemic, calcium supplements and vitamin D should be discontinued, and periodic monitoring of serum magnesium and phosphate levels should be initiated.</p><p>Calcium homeostasis is one of the major functions of bone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-of-therapy-with-bone-antiresorptive-agents-in-patients-with-advanced-malignancy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Consequently, effective inhibition of osteoclast activity can result in hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia. However, most patients do not become hypocalcemic because of compensatory mechanisms, most importantly increased secretion of parathyroid hormone. In some cases, these compensatory mechanisms may be blocked (eg, prior parathyroidectomy, low vitamin D levels, hypomagnesemic hypoparathyroidism, renal failure), resulting in hypocalcemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-of-therapy-with-bone-antiresorptive-agents-in-patients-with-advanced-malignancy/abstract/3,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,13</a>]. Patients are at higher risk of electrolyte imbalance if they have renal insufficiency or decreased compensatory mechanisms.</p><p>The incidence, severity, and time course of hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia can be illustrated by the following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a report of 120 patients who received a total of 546 infusions of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zoledronic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zoledronic acid</a> for multiple myeloma or another malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-of-therapy-with-bone-antiresorptive-agents-in-patients-with-advanced-malignancy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], hypocalcemia developed following 55 infusions (10 percent) in 42 of the patients (35 percent). Symptomatic hypocalcemia requiring IV calcium supplementation occurred in 10 patients (8 percent) despite dose adjustment for creatinine clearance (CrCl) and prophylactic supplementation with oral calcium and vitamin D. Impairment of CrCl was seen more often among subjects developing hypocalcemia than in those remaining normocalcemic. Hypomagnesemia was found in all patients who developed hypocalcemia who had measurement of serum magnesium.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=denosumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Denosumab</a> is a more potent inhibitor of bone resorption than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zoledronic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zoledronic acid</a> as measured by changes in bone turnover markers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-of-therapy-with-bone-antiresorptive-agents-in-patients-with-advanced-malignancy/abstract/4-6,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6,15</a>]. Thus, it is not unexpected that the incidence rates of hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia were greater with denosumab than with zoledronic acid in all three registration trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-of-therapy-with-bone-antiresorptive-agents-in-patients-with-advanced-malignancy/abstract/4-6,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6,16</a>]. In the latest integrated analysis of patient level data from all three conducted trials that differed only as to tumor type, hypocalcemia &ge; grade 2 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F91252\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91252 \">table 2</a>) occurred in 12.4 percent of patients treated with denosumab versus 5.3 percent of those treated with zoledronic acid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-of-therapy-with-bone-antiresorptive-agents-in-patients-with-advanced-malignancy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The median time to first occurrence of hypocalcemia was also shorter with denosumab as compared with zoledronic acid (median 3.8 versus 6.5 months). Most patients experience only a single hypocalcemic episode; however, 43 percent of denosumab-treated patients and 32 percent of zoledronic acid-treated patients had recurrent events. Multivariate analysis suggested a greater risk of hypocalcemia in those with prostate and small cell lung cancer, and in those with reduced creatinine clearance and higher baseline levels of bone turnover markers. In an earlier integrated analysis of all three trials, the incidence of hypophosphatemia of any grade was 2.1 percent with denosumab versus 1.1 percent with zoledronic acid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-of-therapy-with-bone-antiresorptive-agents-in-patients-with-advanced-malignancy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The decreases in calcium have been mostly mild to moderate in severity, asymptomatic, and occur within the first six months of therapy in the majority of patients.

Daily calcium intake &gt;500 mg and supplementation with vitamin D (&gt;400 IU daily) was strongly encouraged in patients enrolled in the registration trials, and adherent patients appeared to have lower adverse events of hypocalcemia.

It is essential that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pamidronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pamidronate</a> be infused at a dose no higher than 90 mg at a rate no faster than over two hours and that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zoledronic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zoledronic acid</a> be given over no less than 15 minutes every three to four weeks. Physicians should not attempt to shorten the infusion time, increase the dose, or reduce the dosing interval. There is no evidence that lengthening the infusion duration from 15 to 30 minutes reduces the rate of renal toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-of-therapy-with-bone-antiresorptive-agents-in-patients-with-advanced-malignancy/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>], although larger studies are needed to further define this issue. Preclinical studies show that negative renal effects of bisphosphonates are related to the maximal serum concentration (Cmax), rather than the Area Under the Curve of concentration x time (AUC), so that longer infusion times are likely to reduce kidney problems without compromising efficacy, which is related to AUC and not Cmax.</p><p>Whether or not less frequent administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zoledronic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zoledronic acid</a> reduces the incidence of renal insufficiency is unclear. Randomized trials, conducted mainly in breast and prostate cancer, have not reported a significantly lower rate of renal insufficiency with the longer dosing interval, but they may be underpowered to demonstrate this. As an example, the CALGB (Alliance) trial 70604 randomly assigned 1822 patients with bone metastases (833 with breast cancer, 674 with prostate cancer, 270 with myeloma, and 45 with other malignancies) to the same dose of zoledronic acid (adjusted based upon calculated creatinine clearance) every four weeks or every 12 weeks for two years, starting with the first dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-of-therapy-with-bone-antiresorptive-agents-in-patients-with-advanced-malignancy/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. In a preliminary report presented at the 2015 annual ASCO meeting, every-12-week treatment was non-inferior in terms of reducing the frequency of skeletal-related events. The two-year cumulative incidence of grade 3 or 4 creatinine increase overall was lower in the every-12-week treatment group (5 versus 11 patients), but the difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.46). Additional follow-up of this and other trials is needed before it can be concluded that less frequent dosing reduces the frequency of renal insufficiency.</p><p>Renal function must be assessed serially in cancer patients who are being treated with these agents, and appropriate dose adjustments <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> temporary cessation of treatment may be required. Guidelines from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) for use of bisphosphonates in breast cancer and multiple myeloma recommend that creatinine be monitored prior to each dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pamidronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pamidronate</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zoledronic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zoledronic acid</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-of-therapy-with-bone-antiresorptive-agents-in-patients-with-advanced-malignancy/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].

For patients experiencing any albuminuria (defined as &gt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/24</span> hours of urinary albumin), discontinuation of drug is advised until resolution of the renal problems. However, it is important to recognize that there may be other causes for the albuminuria such as comorbid conditions (eg, diabetes mellitus) or the development of primary amyloidosis in this at-risk patient population. In contrast to patients with multiple myeloma, ASCO guidelines do not support routine assessment for albuminuria in patients with other malignancies such as breast cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-of-therapy-with-bone-antiresorptive-agents-in-patients-with-advanced-malignancy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

Intravenous calcium replacement was administered to 3 of the 10 patients who developed hypocalcemia, while oral calcium supplements were added or the dose increased in three more. The two patients with grade 3 hypophosphatemia were treated with supplemental phosphate, while none of the grade 2 hypophosphatemic events were treated and all resolved without intervention. In this retrospective analysis, 36 percent of patients were noted to be receiving oral calcium and vitamin D supplementation, but baseline vitamin D levels were not available for the majority of patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=denosumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Denosumab</a> was also not dose adjusted for renal function in any of the phase III registration trials of denosumab in metastatic cancer patients.

(See <a href=\"#H1928329\" class=\"local\">'Osteonecrosis of the jaw'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1930509\" class=\"local\">'Hypocalcemia and other electrolyte abnormalities'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medication-related ONJ (MRONJ) typically presents as pain, infection, and necrotic bone in the mandible or maxilla in a patient receiving long-term treatment with high potency bone modifying agents. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medication-related-osteonecrosis-of-the-jaw-in-patients-with-cancer#H664776064\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw in patients with cancer&quot;, section on 'Nomenclature and definition'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The overall risk is &lt;2 percent in the first year of therapy and increases with further years of therapy. The incidence is slightly (although not significantly) higher with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=denosumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">denosumab</a> than bisphosphonates (1.9 versus 1.3 percent from the pivotal phase III trials). Dentoalveolar surgery is a major risk factor. In view of the difficulty in treating established MRONJ, prevention is emphasized. All patients should have a comprehensive dental examination and preventive dentistry (preemptive extraction of unsalvageable teeth and optimized periodontal health) before beginning therapy with an antiresorptive agent, if possible. Oral exams and hygiene status should be closely monitored by the oncologist during treatment. For patients receiving antiresorptive therapy for cancer, invasive dental procedures (including removal of teeth or placement of dental implants) should be avoided if at all possible (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medication-related-osteonecrosis-of-the-jaw-in-patients-with-cancer#H664780842\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw in patients with cancer&quot;, section on 'Prevention'</a>). However, other less invasive procedures can be completed such as dental cleaning, repair of cavities, crown placement, or root canals. If a dental extraction or other invasive procedure is absolutely essential during therapy, antiresorptive therapy should be held for at least 8 to 12 weeks if possible, and restarted only after complete mucosal healing has been observed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Treatment objectives for patients with an established diagnosis of MRONJ are to eliminate pain, control infection of the soft tissue and bone, and minimize the progression or occurrence of bone necrosis. Treatment has generally shifted away from aggressive surgical interventions to conservative therapy with limited debridement, antibiotics, and oral rinses with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorhexidine</a> or hydrogen peroxide. Resolution occurs in a substantial percentage of patients when treated early. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medication-related-osteonecrosis-of-the-jaw-in-patients-with-cancer#H664781551\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw in patients with cancer&quot;, section on 'Treatment of established MRONJ'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients receiving parenteral therapy with a bone modifying agent for advanced cancer should have calcium and vitamin D levels assessed at baseline, and low levels supplemented prior to initiating therapy. Daily supplementation with calcium and vitamin D is strongly recommended for all patients unless otherwise contraindicated (eg, in patients with hypercalcemia or a history of recurrent renal stones). Most patients should receive a total of 1000 mg of calcium (diet plus supplement) and 800 to 1200 IU of vitamin D daily. However, vitamin D dosing should be based upon serum levels, and recommendations regarding calcium supplementation should be individualized based upon the patient&rsquo;s underlying malignancy (and the risk for developing hypercalcemia) and renal function. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-d-deficiency-in-adults-definition-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vitamin D deficiency in adults: Definition, clinical manifestations, and treatment&quot;, section on 'Dosing'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-and-vitamin-d-supplementation-in-osteoporosis#H13468588\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Calcium and vitamin D supplementation in osteoporosis&quot;, section on 'Optimal intake'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Periodic monitoring of serum magnesium, calcium, and phosphate levels should be obtained (at least quarterly) during therapy with either bisphosphonates or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=denosumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">denosumab</a>. Increased monitoring (eg, monthly) is needed in symptomatic patients and those with baseline renal insufficiency when initiating therapy. If patients become hypercalcemic, calcium supplements and vitamin D should be discontinued.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atypical subtrochanteric and diaphyseal femoral fractures have been reported in patients receiving prolonged antiresorptive therapy, and fractures may occur after minimal or no trauma. Patients with otherwise unexplained thigh or groin pain should be evaluated to rule out a femoral fracture. In addition, specific radiological findings on either plain radiographs or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may suggest this problem. If so, care must be taken to avoid atraumatic fractures, which can be severe, and patients may benefit from prophylactic surgery. (See <a href=\"#H577122678\" class=\"local\">'Atypical fractures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of parenteral bisphosphonates is associated with nephrotoxicity (nephrotic-range proteinuria and acute renal insufficiency), which is both dose and infusion time-dependent. It is most often seen in patients with multiple myeloma. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Management and prevention'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Renal toxicity may be minimized by observing recommended infusion times and creatinine clearance (CrCl) adjusted dosing, optimizing hydration prior to bisphosphonate administration (particularly for patients with marked Bence Jones proteinuria), and avoiding concurrent nephrotoxic medications.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In keeping with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved package insert for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zoledronic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zoledronic acid</a>, a lower initial dose of zoledronic acid (ranging from 3 to 3.5 mg) may be appropriate for patients with preexisting renal impairment (CrCl &lt;60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> but &ge;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min),</span> although clinical studies supporting the efficacy and safety of this adjustment in the dosing of the drug have not been performed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Renal function must be checked before each dose in cancer patients being treated with IV bisphosphonates. Unexplained azotemia or an absolute creatinine level &gt;1.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [124 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L]</span> in patients with normal baseline values should prompt temporary discontinuation of the bisphosphonate. Therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=denosumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">denosumab</a> is preferred as a bone modifying agent for patients with solid tumors who are requiring other nephrotoxic therapies or who have underlying renal dysfunction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with multiple myeloma receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pamidronate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pamidronate</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zoledronic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zoledronic acid</a>, we agree with American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) guidelines that recommend evaluation every three to six months for the presence of albuminuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/risks-of-therapy-with-bone-antiresorptive-agents-in-patients-with-advanced-malignancy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. For patients experiencing any albuminuria (defined as &gt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/24</span> hours of urinary albumin), discontinuation of drug is advised until resolution of the renal problems. ASCO guidelines do not support routine assessment for albuminuria in patients with other malignancies such as breast cancer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other side effects of potential concern to cancer patients receiving IV bisphosphonate therapy include flu-like symptoms (see <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Acute phase response'</a> above); rarely incapacitating bone, joint, or muscle pain (see <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Bone, joint, or muscle pain'</a> above); and possibly atrial <span class=\"nowrap\">fibrillation/stroke</span> (see <a href=\"#H3214834\" class=\"local\">'Atrial fibrillation and stroke'</a> above).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oral and IV bisphosphonates can also be associated with conjunctivitis, uveitis, scleritis, and orbital inflammation. Ocular inflammation requires a prompt ophthalmologic evaluation, and further treatment with the offending bisphosphonate is not recommended. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Ocular toxicities'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As <a href=\"topic.htm?path=denosumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">denosumab</a> is not cleared by the kidneys, dose adjustments or monitoring of renal function are not required or recommended during therapy.
