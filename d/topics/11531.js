Acquired cases of stenosis of the native pulmonary valve are encountered less commonly but may be caused by the carcinoid syndrome or rheumatic fever (in which case pulmonic stenosis is always associated with other valve abnormalities). There are increasing numbers of patients with stenosis of bioprosthetic or valved conduits used in repair of more complex congenital lesions affecting the pulmonary valve, such as tetralogy of Fallot, pulmonary atresia, or truncus arteriosus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonic-stenosis-in-adults#H1\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of pulmonic stenosis in adults&quot;, section on 'Introduction'</a>.)</p><p>Congenital valvular pulmonic stenosis exists in three predominant forms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-history-and-treatment-of-pulmonic-stenosis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most cases involve dome-type pulmonic valve stenosis, which is characterized by a narrow central opening with preserved valve motion. Three rudimentary raphes are generally present without clear-cut commissures. The pulmonary trunk may be dilated due to a medial abnormality. Calcification of the valve can be seen in older patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 20 percent of cases involve pulmonary valve dysplasia, with thickened valve leaflets and relative immobility of the valve (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F91432\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef91432 \">image 1</a>). Pulmonary artery dilation is not commonly associated with dysplastic valves. Dysplastic pulmonary valves are a common component of Noonan syndrome, occurring in up to half of patients in some studies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonic-stenosis-in-adults#H1\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of pulmonic stenosis in adults&quot;, section on 'Introduction'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More complex congenital heart disease, such as cases of tetralogy of Fallot or transposition of the great arteries, may be associated with a unicuspid or bicuspid pulmonary valve, which may be obstructive.

Reconstruction often entails the placement of a pulmonary valve prosthesis, right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery homograft, or valved conduit, which degenerates over time, manifesting as stenosis, regurgitation, or both. Treatment of valve, homograft, or conduit dysfunction may be amenable to surgery or percutaneous valve replacement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-history-and-treatment-of-pulmonic-stenosis-in-adults/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>The natural history and treatment of valvular pulmonic stenosis will be reviewed here. While valvular stenosis in the context of other congenital lesions or more complex congenital heart disease may have similarities, the natural history, clinical consequence, and concomitant lesions may not be the same, which may limit the direct extrapolation of diagnostic strategies and treatment options.

Approximately 24 percent of initially asymptomatic patients in the NHS ultimately required a pulmonic valve procedure for progressive symptoms or right ventricular failure; independent predictors of the need for intervention included more severe elevation in the peak systolic gradient and a reduction in cardiac output [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-history-and-treatment-of-pulmonic-stenosis-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Overall, there were few differences between surgically and medically treated patients with moderate pulmonic stenosis in the NHS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-history-and-treatment-of-pulmonic-stenosis-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

The prevalence and severity of pulmonary regurgitation are higher in patients with pulmonic stenosis who have undergone balloon valvotomy. While mild degrees of pulmonary regurgitation are well tolerated, more significant pulmonary regurgitation may result in right ventricular enlargement and dysfunction, sufficient to consider pulmonary valve replacement. The echocardiographic or cardiac magnetic resonance indication for pulmonic regurgitation in asymptomatic patients is not known. While some practitioners may utilize criteria for other diseases for which pulmonary regurgitation is a common sequela, such as tetralogy of Fallot, data are lacking to support such an approach. </p><p>When the pulmonary valve is replaced, surgery is the available option, though there is an ongoing clinical trial of percutaneous pulmonary valve replacement in native outflow tracts.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR INTERVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We agree with the 2008 American College of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/American</span> Heart Association <span class=\"nowrap\">(ACC/AHA)</span> adult congenital heart disease recommendations for intervention in patients with pulmonic stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-history-and-treatment-of-pulmonic-stenosis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For asymptomatic patients with a domed pulmonic valve and peak instantaneous Doppler gradient &gt;60 mmHg or a mean Doppler gradient &gt;40 mmHg (in association with &lt; moderate pulmonic valve regurgitation), balloon valvotomy is recommended.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For symptomatic patients with a domed pulmonic valve and peak instantaneous Doppler gradient &gt;50 mmHg or a mean Doppler gradient &gt;30 mmHg (in association with &lt; moderate pulmonic valve regurgitation), balloon valvotomy is recommended.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical therapy is recommended for patients with severe pulmonic stenosis and an associated hypoplastic pulmonary annulus, severe pulmonary regurgitation, subvalvular pulmonic stenosis, or supravalvular pulmonic stenosis.

Forty of the patients were treated with open valvotomy, with infundibular resection in 13. The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thirty-five reinterventions were performed in 28 patients (53 percent), including pulmonary valve replacement for regurgitation in 21, open valvotomy in five, and balloon valvotomy in three.

As discussed above, the NHS found that intervention was rarely needed in long-term follow-up of patients with baseline mild disease, and that intervention was eventually required in approximately one-quarter of initially asymptomatic patients with moderate disease because of progressive symptoms or right heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-history-and-treatment-of-pulmonic-stenosis-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

Procedural mortality was less than 0.5 percent. Among the 196 patients in whom such data could be obtained, transvalvular and infundibular obstruction were each responsible for about one-half of the total residual gradient. After balloon valvuloplasty, a residual infundibular gradient tended to decline over several months as right ventricular hypertrophy diminished. Other studies reported similar reductions in the systolic outflow gradient (eg, 91 to 38 mmHg and 93 versus 19 mmHg) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-history-and-treatment-of-pulmonic-stenosis-in-adults/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Long-term efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The long-term efficacy of percutaneous balloon valvotomy was evaluated in a series of 53 adolescent and adult patients 13 to 55 years of age treated between 1985 and 1995 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/natural-history-and-treatment-of-pulmonic-stenosis-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

The mean transvalvular gradient fell from 93 to 19 mmHg immediately after the procedure, and was 18 mmHg at follow-up. Progressive spontaneous regression of infundibular hypertrophy was noted.
