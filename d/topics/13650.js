Biochemical connective tissue changes in the uterine cervix appear to precede uterine contractions and cervical dilation, and all of these events usually occur before rupture of the fetal membranes.</p><p>Term labor may be regarded physiologically as a release from the inhibitory effects of pregnancy on the myometrium, rather than as an active process mediated by uterine stimulants. As an example, strips of myometrium obtained from a quiescent uterus at term and placed in an isotonic water bath will contract vigorously and spontaneously without added stimuli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Nevertheless, both inhibitory and stimulatory mechanisms likely play a role in uterine activity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSIOLOGICAL PHASES OF MYOMETRIAL ACTIVITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The regulation of uterine activity during pregnancy can be divided into four distinct physiologic phases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Phase 0: inhibitors active</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Throughout most of pregnancy the uterus is maintained in a state of functional quiescence through the action of various putative inhibitors including, but not limited to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Progesterone</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prostacyclin (prostaglandin I-2)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relaxin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Parathyroid hormone-related peptide</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nitric oxide</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Calcitonin gene-related peptide</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adrenomedullin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vasoactive intestinal peptide.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Phase 1: myometrial activation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As term approaches, the uterus becomes activated in response to uterotropins, such as estrogen. This phase is characterized by increased expression of a series of contraction-associated proteins (CAPs) (including myometrial receptors for prostaglandins and oxytocin), activation of specific ion channels, and an increase in connexin-43 (a key component of gap junctions). An increase in gap junction formation between adjacent myometrial cells leads to electrical synchrony within the myometrium and allows for effective coordination of contractions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Phase 2: stimulatory phase</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following activation, the &quot;primed&quot; uterus can be stimulated to contract by the action of uterotonic agonists, such as the stimulatory prostaglandins E2 and F2 alpha and oxytocin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Phase 3: involution</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Involution of the uterus after delivery occurs during phase 3 and is mediated primarily by oxytocin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">PARTURITION CASCADE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is likely that a &quot;parturition cascade&quot; exists at term which removes the mechanisms maintaining uterine quiescence and recruits factors promoting uterine activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. Given its teleological importance, such a cascade would likely have multiple redundant loops to ensure a fail-safe system of securing pregnancy success (and thus preserving the species). In such a model, each element is connected to the next in a sequential fashion, and many of the elements demonstrate positive feed-forward characteristics typical of a cascade mechanism.</p><p>The sequential recruitment of signals that serve to augment the labor process suggest that it may not be possible to single out any one signaling mechanism as being responsible for the initiation of labor. Therefore, it is prudent to describe such mechanisms as being responsible for &quot;promoting,&quot; rather than &quot;initiating,&quot; the process of labor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">THE ROLE OF THE FETUS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Considerable evidence suggests that, in most viviparous animals, the fetus controls the timing of onset of labor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. During the Hippocratic period, the fetus was thought to be positioned head down at term so it could kick its legs up against the fundus of the uterus, thereby propelling itself through the birth canal. While we have moved away from this simple and mechanical view of labor, the factors responsible for the initiation and maintenance of labor at term are not well defined. Initial investigations focused on endocrine events, such as changes in the profile of circulating hormone levels in the maternal and fetal circulations. Subsequent studies have concentrated on the dynamic biochemical dialogue between the fetus and mother <span class=\"nowrap\">(paracrine/autocrine</span> events) in an attempt to understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate such interactions. The genetic regulation of the molecular events that occur during parturition are also being investigated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>The hypothesis that the fetus is in control of the timing of labor was elegantly demonstrated in domestic ruminants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/13-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-17</a>]. As an example, parturition in sheep is initiated by a sharp rise in fetal adrenal cortisol secretion related to increased fetal concentrations of and responsiveness to corticotropin&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Cortisol acts on placental enzymes active in the biosynthesis of estrogens from progesterone to augment secretion of estrogen and decrease progesterone production. The resulting increase in the ratio of estrogen to progesterone stimulates placental release of prostaglandin F2 alpha, which enhances the myometrial response to oxytocin and stimulates contractions.</p><p>However, the human placenta lacks the glucocorticoid-inducible <span class=\"nowrap\">17-alpha-hydroxylase/17,20-lyase</span> enzyme that is essential to this process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/11,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,18,19</a>]. Therefore, activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in humans likely results in a different mechanism for initiation of labor (see <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Estrogen'</a> below).</p><p>A role for the fetal genotype in the initiation of labor was suggested by horse-donkey crossbreeding experiments that resulted in a gestational length intermediate between that of horses (340 days) and that of donkeys (365 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/11,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,18</a>]. This concept holds true whether pregnancy is maintained by the fetoplacental unit (as in the sheep and human) or by extrauterine tissues (as in the mouse and goat) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>The slow progress in our understanding of the biochemical mechanisms involved in the process of labor in humans reflects, in large part, the difficulty in extrapolating from the endocrine-control mechanisms in various animals to the <span class=\"nowrap\">paracrine/autocrine</span> mechanisms of human parturition, processes that preclude direct investigation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">MYOMETRIAL ACTIVATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Regardless of whether the trigger originates within or outside the fetus, the final common pathway for labor ends in the maternal tissues of the uterus and is characterized by the development of regular phasic uterine contractions. As in other smooth muscles, myometrial contractions are mediated through ATP-dependent binding of myosin to actin. This interaction is dependent upon the phosphorylation of myosin light chain by a <span class=\"nowrap\">calcium/calmodulin-dependent</span> enzyme, myosin light chain kinase. The availability of free intracellular calcium is thus a key modulator of myometrial contractility.</p><p>GTP-binding proteins (G-proteins) play a pivotal role in myometrial contractility by coupling cell membrane receptors to effector enzymes and ion channels. As an example, activation of beta-adrenergic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> PGE2 receptors promote myometrial relaxation via the <span class=\"nowrap\">Gas/adenyl</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">cyclase/cAMP</span> signal transduction pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/1,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,20</a>]. Oxytocin receptors, on the other hand, couple to <span class=\"nowrap\">Gaq/Gai/phospholipase</span> C pathways leading to an increase in inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (which releases calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum) and 1,2-diacylglycerol (which activates protein kinase C) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The end result is an increase in intracellular calcium and myometrial contractions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p>Pregnancy affects not only cell surface receptor concentrations, but also the concentrations and coupling of the various G-proteins. Gaq and Gai are expressed at similar levels in nonpregnant and pregnant myometrium, both before and after the onset of labor. By comparison, Gas levels are higher in pregnant as compared with nonpregnant myometrium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], and levels have been shown to decrease before labor, both at term and preterm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. It has been suggested, therefore, that labor results from a down-regulation of pathways that favor uterine quiescence leading to a relative dominance of stimulatory pathways that increase intracellular calcium bioavailability and promote myometrial contractility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Other myometrial factors (eg, mechanotransduction via stretching or shortening) which could affect initiation, frequency, or strength of contractions are under investigation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].</p><p>In contrast to vascular smooth muscle, myometrial cells have sparse innervation, which is further reduced during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The regulation of the contractile mechanism of the uterus is therefore largely humoral <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dependent upon intrinsic factors within myometrial cells. A number of hormones have been implicated in this regard. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">HORMONES INVOLVED IN THE PARTURITIONAL CASCADE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Comprehensive analyses of each of the individual <span class=\"nowrap\">paracrine/autocrine</span> pathways involved in the process of labor have been reviewed in detail elsewhere&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/3-8,14,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-8,14,18</a>]. A few of the hormones implicated in this process are discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Prostaglandins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prostaglandins are predominantly <span class=\"nowrap\">paracrine/autocrine</span> hormones (ie, they act locally at their site of production on contiguous cells). An increase in uterine prostaglandin biosynthesis is a consistent element in the transition into labor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], and is probably common to all viviparous species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. It seems likely that hormonal factors controlling the final pathway for the onset of labor in women, both at term and preterm, is an increased synthesis of prostaglandins of the E and F series within the uterine compartment, predominantly from the decidua and fetal membranes. The evidence can be summarized as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Human uterine tissues are selectively enriched with arachidonic acid, the obligate precursor of prostaglandin biosynthesis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Concentrations of prostaglandins in amniotic fluid and in maternal plasma and urine are increased during parturition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/28,30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,30,31</a>]. Moreover, prostaglandin levels appear to rise prior to the onset of myometrial concentrations suggesting that they are a cause, rather than a consequence, of labor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The intraamniotic, intravenous, or vaginal administration of exogenous prostaglandins can initiate labor at any stage of gestation and in all species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prostaglandins have been implicated in the three events most temporally related to the onset of labor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/2,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,34</a>]: the onset of synchronous uterine contractions, cervical ripening, and the increase in myometrial sensitivity to oxytocin due to an increase in myometrial gap junction formation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> oxytocin receptor concentrations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis (including cyclooxygenase inhibitors such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indomethacin</a>) are capable of suppressing myometrial contractility both in vitro and in vivo, and of prolonging the length of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/2,35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,35,36</a>].</p><p/><p>Taken together, these data affirm the critical role of prostaglandins in the process of labor. It appears that withdrawal of fetal-paracrine support of the quiescent uterus leads to decidual activation, followed by PGF2 alpha release and subsequent spontaneous labor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. PGE2 appears to play a more important role in cervical ripening (a remodeling process in which collagen is degraded leading to softening of the cervix) and rupture of the fetal membranes than in uterine contractility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Progesterone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Administration of a progesterone receptor antagonist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>] or removal of the corpus luteum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>] readily induces abortion in early pregnancy (before seven weeks of gestation), suggesting that progesterone is necessary for early pregnancy maintenance. Administration of exogenous progesterone after early lutectomy prevents abortion, further supporting the hypothesis that ovarian progesterone production is essential in maintenance of early pregnancy. Placental progesterone production increases between five and seven weeks, and the placenta is the dominant source of progesterone thereafter.</p><p>However, the role of progesterone in late pregnancy is not as well defined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Progesterone withdrawal does not occur in all women before labor, and mean circulating progesterone levels during labor are similar to those measured one week prior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Moreover, the administration of progesterone late in pregnancy does not delay the onset of labor in primates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>], and progesterone receptor antagonists are not an effective way of inducing labor at term (although they may promote cervical ripening) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. Finally, pregnancies complicated by maternal hypobetalipoproteinemia (LDL deficiency with very low levels of progesterone) culminate in spontaneous labor at term without incident [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>These data suggest that systemic progesterone withdrawal is not a prerequisite for labor in humans. This is in contrast to most mammalian species in which systemic progesterone withdrawal is an essential component of parturition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. However, circulating hormone concentrations do not necessarily reflect activity at the tissue level. The onset of labor in women does appear to be preceded by a physiologic withdrawal of progesterone activity (&quot;functional progesterone withdrawal&quot;) at the level of the uterus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>On the other hand, there is increasing evidence that supplemental progesterone administration reduces the rate of preterm birth in high-risk women. Further investigation is needed to confirm the effectiveness of progesterone supplementation and to understand its mechanism of action. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progesterone-supplementation-to-reduce-the-risk-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Progesterone supplementation to reduce the risk of spontaneous preterm birth&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Estrogen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The placenta is the primary source of estrogen biosynthesis during pregnancy. Estrogens do not themselves cause myometrial contractions, and maternal administration of estradiol to rhesus macaques from 130 days of gestation has no effect on length of pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Instead, estrogens act by upregulating myometrial gap junctions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>] and uterotonic receptors (including L-type calcium channels and oxytocin receptors) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>], thereby enhancing the capacity of the myometrium to generate contractions.</p><p>Longitudinal measurements of circulating estrogen concentrations prior to the onset of labor show an increase in all primate species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Because the primate placenta is an incomplete steroidogenic organ, placental estrogen synthesis has an obligate need for C-19 steroid precursors (it cannot synthesize estrogen from progesterone) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. The fetal adrenal provides an abundant C19 estrogen precursor (dehydroepiandrostenedione) directly from its intermediate (fetal) zone. In the rhesus monkey, continuous infusion of C19 precursor (androstenedione) leads to preterm delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/51-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-53</a>]. This effect is blocked by concurrent infusion of an aromatase inhibitor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>], demonstrating that localized conversion of progesterone to estrogen is important in promoting contractions in this species. A similar effect has been shown using a continuous intraamniotic infusion of estrogen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. However, systemic infusion of estrogen failed to induce delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>], suggesting that the action of estrogen is likely <span class=\"nowrap\">paracrine/autocrine</span>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Oxytocin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oxytocin is a peptide hormone synthesized in the hypothalamus and released from the posterior pituitary in a pulsatile fashion. It is also produced by the placenta. Its biologic half-life in the maternal circulation is approximately three to four minutes, but appears to be shorter when higher doses are infused. Oxytocin is inactivated in the liver and kidney, although during pregnancy it is primarily degraded by placental oxytocinase. The evidence in support of a role for oxytocin in parturition can be summarized briefly as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oxytocin is the most potent endogenous uterotonic agent, and is capable of stimulating uterine contractions at intravenous infusion rates of 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/min</span> at term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The frequency and amplitude of oxytocin-induced uterine contractions are identical to those occurring during spontaneous labor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More than 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/min</span> oxytocin is needed to elicit uterine contractions in nonpregnant women, while 16 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/</span> min is sufficient to elicit contractions at 20 weeks of gestation, 2 to 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/min</span> at 32 weeks, and 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/min</span> at term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Uterine contractions can be induced by electrical stimulation of the posterior pituitary gland or by nipple stimulation, presumably by increasing oxytocin concentrations in the blood.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oxytocin analogues that act as competitive antagonists of endogenous oxytocin are capable of inhibiting uterine contractions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p/><p>Circulating levels of oxytocin do not change significantly during pregnancy or prior to the onset of labor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>]. However, myometrial oxytocin receptor concentrations increase approximately 100 to 200-fold during pregnancy, reaching a maximum during early labor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/54,55,57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55,57,58</a>]. This rise in receptor concentration accounts for the increased sensitivity of the myometrium to circulating levels of oxytocin during the second half of pregnancy.</p><p>Specific high-affinity oxytocin receptors have also been isolated apart from the myometrium in the human amnion and decidua parietalis, but not decidua vera [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/49,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,54</a>]. Neither amnion nor decidual cells are contractile, and the action of oxytocin on these tissues is uncertain. Oxytocin may play a dual role in the mechanism of parturition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/54,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,57</a>]: It acts directly through oxytocin receptor-mediated and nonreceptor, voltage-mediated calcium channels to affect intracellular biochemical pathways and promote uterine contractions and it acts indirectly through stimulation of amniotic and decidual prostaglandin production. Indeed, induction of labor at term is successful only when the oxytocin infusion is associated with an increase in PGF2 alpha production, in spite of apparently adequate uterine contractions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>Studies examining fetal pituitary oxytocin production, the umbilical arteriovenous difference in plasma oxytocin concentration, amniotic fluid oxytocin levels, and fetal urinary oxytocin output demonstrate conclusively that the fetus secretes oxytocin into the maternal circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/54,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,59</a>]. Furthermore, the calculated oxytocin secretion rates from the fetus suggest an increase from a baseline of 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/min</span> prior to labor to approximately 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/min</span> after spontaneous labor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. The latter is similar to the dose of oxytocin normally administered to women to induce labor at term (2 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mU/min)</span>. Although maternal serum oxytocin levels are not increased prior to the onset of labor or during the first stage of labor, oxytocin derived from the fetus and possibly from local decidual and other uterine sources could act on myometrial oxytocin receptors in a <span class=\"nowrap\">paracrine/autocrine</span> fashion to initiate and maintain effective uterine contractions.

The existence of the so-called Ferguson reflex (release of maternal oxytocin from the posterior pituitary in response to distention of the cervix <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vagina) remains controversial. Originally described in feline species, it almost certainly does not exist in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The final common pathway for initiation of labor appears to be activation of the fetal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, which is probably a common pathway for all species.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Corticotropin releasing hormone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Activation of the fetal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis during the latter part of pregnancy results in release of large amounts of fetal cortisol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>]. Glucocorticoids (including cortisol) are potent stimulants of placental corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) production, in contrast to their negative effect on hypothalamic CRH production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Inflammatory cytokines, catecholamines, acetylcholine, and oxytocin also increase placental CRH secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], while progesterone and nitric oxide (NO) decrease placental CRH release. Circulating maternal plasma CRH levels increase progressively throughout the latter half of pregnancy, with a dramatic increase in the final six to eight weeks before delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>].</p><p>During pregnancy, CRH bioactivity (as measured by its ability to promote ACTH release from the pituitary and to stimulate decidual PGE2 production) is decreased due to an increase in high-affinity CRH-binding protein (CRH-BP). However, in the last three to five weeks of gestation, CRH-BP concentrations fall, resulting in a rapid rise in circulating free CRH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65</a>].</p><p>Women with an early rapid rise in plasma CRH tend to deliver earlier and those with a slow rise tend to deliver later, suggesting that production of CRH is an important factor in the timing of delivery.

The concentration of some of these agents changes in maternal serum during pregnancy suggesting that they might act in an endocrine fashion, while others are produced locally within myometrial smooth muscle cells and act in an <span class=\"nowrap\">autocrine/paracrine</span> manner. However, their role in the initiation and maintenance of labor at term remains controversial. Some of these factors are illustrated below:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Parathyroid hormone-related peptide</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Parathyroid hormone-related peptide is a potent smooth muscle relaxant capable of inhibiting oxytocin-induced contractions in baboons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].

This effect is likely mediated through the adenyl cyclase signal transduction system resulting in an increase in intracellular cAMP, which favors uterine relaxation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">Relaxin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Relaxin is a member of the insulin-like growth factor family of proteins.

The primary source of relaxin is thought to be the corpus luteum.</p><p>Relaxin appears to act indirectly to promote myometrial relaxation by stimulating myometrial prostacyclin production. This effect can be negated by inhibitors of prostaglandin synthesis. Relaxin also has been implicated in cervical ripening <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> rupture of the fetal membranes, but this remains controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h3\">Cytokines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cytokines have long been implicated in the pathophysiology of preterm labor associated with intraamniotic infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>].

Proinflammatory mediator levels (IL-1, IL-6, TNF-alpha) appear to increase in the maternal peripheral circulation before the onset of spontaneous term labor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. The developing fetus may produce physical and hormonal signals that stimulate macrophage migration to the uterus, with release of cytokines and activation of inflammatory transcription factors. </p><p>Concentrations of interleukin (IL) -8 (but not IL-2 or tumor necrosis factor alpha) in human myometrium, decidua, and fetal membranes are increased during labor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. IL-8 is a potent chemotactic cytokine acting primarily on neutrophils. It may cause an increase in collagenase enzyme activity leading to cervical ripening <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> spontaneous rupture of membranes. Moreover, cytokines and eicosanoids appear to interact and to accelerate each other's production in a cascade-like fashion, resulting in further increases in prostaglandin production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. It has also been proposed that the increased inflammatory response promotes uterine contractility via direct activation of contractile genes (eg, COX-2, oxytocin receptor, connexin) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> impairment of the capacity of progesterone to mediate uterine quiescence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/physiology-of-parturition/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13544851\"><span class=\"h1\">MEMBRANE RUPTURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The strength and integrity of fetal membranes derive from extracellular membrane proteins including collagens, fibronectin, and laminins.
