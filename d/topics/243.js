The pathogenesis, clinical presentation, evaluation, and prognosis of acute cerebellar ataxia will be reviewed here.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-child-with-acute-ataxia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the child with acute ataxia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In adults, a wide variety of processes can cause cerebellar ataxia, and these can present with acute or chronic disease courses. The diagnostic considerations in an adult with ataxia are discussed separately.

The incidence of this disorder in the pediatric age group is at least 1 in 100,000 to 500,000, making it the most common cause of ataxia in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cerebellar-ataxia-in-children/abstract/3,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7,8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute cerebellar ataxia may occur unheralded or, more commonly, after an acute febrile illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cerebellar-ataxia-in-children/abstract/1-3,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3,5</a>]. Varicella infection-induced cases, once the most common single postinfectious cause, has diminished due to vaccination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cerebellar-ataxia-in-children/abstract/7,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-of-varicella-zoster-virus-infection-chickenpox#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features of varicella-zoster virus infection: Chickenpox&quot;, section on 'Neurologic complications'</a>.)</p><p>Numerous other infectious agents have been implicated in the pathogenesis of acute cerebellar ataxia, including coxsackievirus, echovirus, enteroviruses, Epstein-Barr virus, hepatitis A, herpes simplex virus I, human herpesvirus 6, measles, mumps, parvovirus B19, <em>Borrelia burgdorferi</em> (Lyme disease), malaria, <em>Mycoplasma pneumoniae</em>, and typhoid fever [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cerebellar-ataxia-in-children/abstract/2,10-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,10-18</a>]. The syndrome has been anecdotally reported following vaccination for varicella, hepatitis B, rabies, meningococcal group C, and human papilloma virus, all without evidence of systemic infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cerebellar-ataxia-in-children/abstract/1,2,19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,19-22</a>]. However, rates after vaccination are much lower than in association with infection: For example, the association of acute cerebellar ataxia with varicella infection is at least 35 times higher than after vaccination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cerebellar-ataxia-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>The pathogenic mechanisms that underlie acute cerebellar ataxia have not been definitively established but are believed to be autoimmune in nature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cerebellar-ataxia-in-children/abstract/1,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8</a>]. Antiviral antibodies and autoantibodies against centrosomes, glutamate receptor delta 2, myelin-associated glycoprotein, neurons, and triosephosphate isomerase have been isolated from serum <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in affected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cerebellar-ataxia-in-children/abstract/1,8,15,23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8,15,23-26</a>]. However, in other case reports, viral nucleic acids have been identified in the CSF, suggesting that infection of brain tissue may contribute to the disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cerebellar-ataxia-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Radiologic studies in patients with recent onset of acute cerebellar ataxia generally are normal; if lesions are seen, they are usually limited to the cerebellum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cerebellar-ataxia-in-children/abstract/1,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute cerebellar ataxia is characterized by rapid onset and progression of symptoms, typically developing over a few hours to one or two days. In cases associated with a prodromal illness, the ataxia typically follows it within days to three weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cerebellar-ataxia-in-children/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>]. Gait disturbance is the primary symptom in most patients, but in other patients the cerebellar dysfunction may be limited to fine motor control problems or tremor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cerebellar-ataxia-in-children/abstract/1,2,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,9</a>]. Associated symptoms may include nystagmus (present in roughly one-half of cases reported), slurred or garbled speech, vomiting, irritability, dysarthria, or, in older children, headache [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cerebellar-ataxia-in-children/abstract/2,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8</a>]. Fever, meningismus, and seizures are absent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cerebellar-ataxia-in-children/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute cerebellar ataxia should be suspected in a child presenting with the sudden onset of ataxia. The evaluation is directed toward exclusion of other potentially more serious illnesses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cerebellar-ataxia-in-children/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3748435650\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The history should explore the nature of any neurologic symptoms and timing of their onset, including whether there have been any chronic or episodic neurologic symptoms in the past. In children with acute cerebellar ataxia, the degree of ataxia and gait disturbance varies widely but generally has rapid onset. Mild acute manifestations may be overlooked by caregivers (leading to under-reporting of the syndrome), but symptoms can be sufficiently severe to lead to an emergency department visit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cerebellar-ataxia-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In contrast, mild chronic manifestations may also be overlooked, leading to under-recognition of the slow evolution of a more ominous chronic condition.</p><p>The history should include questions about antecedent illness, prior vaccinations, head trauma, and potential exposure to intoxicating agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cerebellar-ataxia-in-children/abstract/2,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8</a>]. The presence of somnolence, extreme irritability, fever, meningismus, weakness, focal asymmetric neurologic findings, or an insidious onset of ataxia should raise concern for other illnesses in the differential diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cerebellar-ataxia-in-children/abstract/2,3,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,8</a>].

It is important to note that opsoclonus may be present transiently and multifocal myoclonus can be difficult to distinguish clinically from truncal titubation, and thus this important diagnosis may be delayed. Clinicians should always be vigilant for the possibility of this diagnosis when making a diagnosis of acute cerebellar ataxia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=opsoclonus-myoclonus-syndrome#H24047689\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Opsoclonus myoclonus syndrome&quot;, section on 'Pediatric syndrome'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asymmetric neurologic deficits are not typical in acute cerebellar ataxia and may indicate a structural lesion of the central nervous system, stroke or vertebral artery dissection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cerebellar-ataxia-in-children/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], or acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM). In ADEM, somnolence and weakness are prominent.

Associated symptoms may include nystagmus, slurred or garbled speech, vomiting, irritability, dysarthria, or headache. Fever, meningismus, and seizures are absent. Most cases occur in toddlers or school-aged children, in many cases the symptoms develop a few days or weeks after a viral illness. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute cerebellar ataxia should be suspected in a child presenting with the sudden onset of ataxia, especially if there was an associated prodromal illness within the previous few weeks. The evaluation is aimed at excluding other causes of acute ataxia including toxic ingestion, head trauma, and infections or structural lesions of the brain. Ataxia may also be caused by metabolic, oncologic, or neurodegenerative processes, which often have gradual or intermittent onset of symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F79383\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79383 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3748435650\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-child-with-acute-ataxia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the child with acute ataxia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The history should investigate the possibility of occult toxic exposure or head trauma and whether there have been any chronic or episodic neurologic symptoms in the past. The physical examination should assess for unusual signs such as fever, altered mental status, asymmetric <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> focal neurologic deficits, weakness, or areflexia. Any of these findings should raise concern for other illnesses in the differential diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) should be obtained whenever unusual features such as fever, meningismus, loss of reflexes, weakness, or altered mental status raise concern for central nervous system infection or Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome. CSF analysis in acute cerebellar ataxia is typically normal or shows a mild lymphocytic pleocytosis, with or without elevations in protein. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neuroimaging is not necessary for children with typical features; however, brain imaging should be performed if there are atypical findings (eg, altered consciousness, asymmetric focal weakness, sensory loss, abnormal reflexes, acquired ocular malalignment, atypical disease course [eg, previous episodes of ataxia, worsening ataxia, additional neurologic <span class=\"nowrap\">symptoms/signs],</span> new unremitting headache, or recent history of head or neck trauma). When imaging is indicated, magnetic resonance imaging is the preferred method. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of acute cerebellar ataxia is made clinically after excluding other potentially more serious illnesses. In most cases with typical presenting symptoms, this can be accomplished with a focused history, detailed general and neurologic examination, and a toxicology screen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F77260\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef77260 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3327764288\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prognosis for children with typical features of acute cerebellar ataxia is good. Approximately 90 percent of patients have complete resolution of symptoms within a few weeks without specific treatment, while up to 10 percent have some long-term neurologic sequelae. No specific treatments have been evaluated. Worsening disease course or persistence of symptoms beyond three weeks should prompt further evaluation for other causes of ataxia. (See <a href=\"#H112357668\" class=\"local\">'Treatment and monitoring'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Steve Maricich, PhD, MD, and Mark Helm, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-cerebellar-ataxia-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Connolly AM, Dodson WE, Prensky AL, Rust RS.
