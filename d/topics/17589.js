Patients with brain tumors have a substantial risk for developing VTE due to a hypercoagulable state, neurosurgical procedures, and often leg paresis. However, there is concern that antithrombotic agents can precipitate hemorrhage into the tumor with neurologic worsening.</p><p>The balance between these issues is discussed here. The overall risk, diagnosis, and treatment of VTE in patients with malignancy, as well as risk and treatment of anticoagulant-associated intracerebral hemorrhage, are reviewed separately.

The trial showed a nonsignificant reduction in the rate of recurrent thrombosis in the edoxaban arm but a higher rate of major bleeding. The rate of serious bleeding, which included intracranial hemorrhage, was equal between the groups. While these data provide support for the use of edoxaban in patients with cancer who prefer an oral agent, the experience in patients with brain tumors remains quite limited. These agents do not require injections or drug level monitoring, but antidotes or specific reversal agents for some of the DOACs are lacking, and routine coagulation tests cannot be used to determine the degree of anticoagulation.
