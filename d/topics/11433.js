During systole, this segment of the vessel is compressed, a condition referred to as milking or systolic &quot;myocardial bridging&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myocardial-bridging-of-the-coronary-arteries/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. This phenomenon was first recognized more than 200 years ago [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myocardial-bridging-of-the-coronary-arteries/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], was first reported in depth in 1951, and was recognized angiographically in 1960.</p><p>On angiography, bridging is recognized as compression of a segment of a coronary artery during systole, resulting in narrowing that reverses during diastole. The dynamic and phasic nature of the obstruction serves to differentiate bridging from fixed coronary stenosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F50411\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef50411 \">image 1</a>).</p><p>It has been thought that most instances of bridging are of little clinical significance. However, there are reports suggesting that severe bridging of the major coronary arteries can produce myocardial ischemia, coronary thrombosis, and myocardial infarction, as well as predispose the patient to atherosclerosis or sudden death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myocardial-bridging-of-the-coronary-arteries/abstract/4-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE OF BRIDGING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The reported prevalence of bridging varies according to the method of evaluation. Pathologic studies have found a mean frequency of myocardial bridging of 25 percent (range 5 to 86 percent), similar to that observed in noninvasive imaging studies using coronary computed tomography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myocardial-bridging-of-the-coronary-arteries/abstract/1,2,11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,11-14</a>]. In one autopsy study, the incidence was 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myocardial-bridging-of-the-coronary-arteries/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Although all major epicardial coronary arteries can be affected, involvement of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) is the most common. </p><p>Angiographic studies have noted somewhat different findings. Among patients undergoing coronary angiography, the reported prevalence of myocardial bridging is 1.7 percent (range 0.5 to 16 percent), which is almost always confined to the LAD (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F50411\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef50411 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myocardial-bridging-of-the-coronary-arteries/abstract/1,2,5,15-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,5,15-19</a>]. A higher prevalence has been observed in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and in recipients of cardiac transplants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myocardial-bridging-of-the-coronary-arteries/abstract/1,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,19,20</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Bridging in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy'</a> below.)</p><p>The difference in prevalence when estimated by these modalities reflects the fact that angiographic evidence of myocardial bridging depends upon a variety of factors, including the thickness of the myocardium, the length of the bridged segment, the orientation of the coronary artery to the myocardial fibers, the nature of the tissue interposed between the coronary artery and the myocardium, and the observer's experience. We believe that many examples of bridging go unrecognized on angiography, including involvement of the left circumflex and right coronary arteries.</p><p>In one study of 100 patients using computed tomography (CT) angiography, myocardial bridging of coronary arteries was found in 34 percent, but only approximately one-third of these showed systolic compression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myocardial-bridging-of-the-coronary-arteries/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In another study using CT angiography, myocardial bridging was found to be a common anatomic variant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myocardial-bridging-of-the-coronary-arteries/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

As an example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a>&nbsp;<strong>augments</strong> the severity of compression, probably by reflex sympathetic stimulation of contractility <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a lower intraluminal pressure in the coronary artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myocardial-bridging-of-the-coronary-arteries/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>The degree of bridging is usually neither extensive nor severe. However, there is again a large degree of variability among patients:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bridging may involve a large segment of the vessel, extending from the origin to more than two-thirds of the vessel length, thereby jeopardizing the flow to secondary branches.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In some cases, bridging is so severe that there is almost complete obliteration of the vessel lumen during systole (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F50411\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef50411 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myocardial-bridging-of-the-coronary-arteries/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bridging can involve the secondary branches, especially the septal perforators (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F73855\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73855 \">picture 1</a>). Systolic compression of septal perforators appears to be more common in patients with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, in whom it has been postulated to be one of several mechanisms responsible for myocardial ischemia.

There are, however, two important considerations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Frame by frame analysis of cine coronary angiograms has shown a &quot;spill over&quot; phenomenon that is characterized by persistence of narrowing in early diastole. In general, the more severe the systolic narrowing is, the more likely that spill over will occur.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With tachycardia, there is more systolic compression and systole occupies a greater percentage of the cardiac cycle because of shortening of diastolic filling period.</p><p/><p>These mechanisms may explain why several studies of rapid atrial pacing or pharmacologic stimulation with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a> detected evidence of myocardial ischemia in patients with isolated systolic bridging of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). It should be cautioned, however, that pacing stress may differ from exercise stress: There is a progressive decrease in systolic blood pressure with pacing versus a progressive increase with exercise. The elevation in intracoronary systolic pressure with exercise may help to prevent compression. There are no comparative data between pacing and exercise to test this hypothesis. The use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adenosine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=regadenoson-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">regadenoson</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dipyridamole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dipyridamole</a>, which do not increase contractility or cause significant tachycardia, may underestimate ischemia potentially related to myocardial bridging.</p><p>Quantitative coronary angiography has been combined with intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and Doppler flow measurements in patients with isolated bridging of the proximal LAD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myocardial-bridging-of-the-coronary-arteries/abstract/1,15-19,23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,15-19,23-25</a>].

The following are representative findings from small series:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In clinical studies using stress myocardial perfusion imaging, the rate of myocardial ischemia has varied widely (21 to 88 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myocardial-bridging-of-the-coronary-arteries/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. This variation is likely due to differences in the populations studied and the type of stress and imaging performed. <br/><br/>In a study of 11 patients with bridging who were evaluated with both pacing and exercise, five patients had more than 75 percent systolic narrowing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myocardial-bridging-of-the-coronary-arteries/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

One possible cause for myocardial ischemia and a poorer outcome in these children is myocardial bridging, which appears to be especially common in this population. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H3182149042\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in children: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Signs and symptoms'</a>.)</p><p>Reports have suggested that bridging in children with HCM is an important risk factor for cardiac complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myocardial-bridging-of-the-coronary-arteries/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. The potential risk was illustrated in an angiographic study of 36 children with HCM, 10 of whom (28 percent) had myocardial bridging of the LAD persisting for 50 percent of diastole [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myocardial-bridging-of-the-coronary-arteries/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

The dynamic and phasic nature of the obstruction serves to differentiate bridging from fixed coronary stenosis. In our experience, bridging is easier to recognize in the left anterior oblique than right anterior oblique projections.</p><p>The use of the Doppler-flow catheter and IVUS has been important to the understanding of the physiologic significance of bridging. Electron beam computed tomography (CT), multislice CT, magnetic resonance tomography, and transthoracic Doppler echocardiography have been used to detect bridging, but their overall role is not yet clear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myocardial-bridging-of-the-coronary-arteries/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For treatment of angina caused by myocardial bridging, beta blockers and possibly nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are preferred because they reduce heart rate and myocardial contractility.

Dissection of the overlying myocardial fibers with complete exposure of the coronary artery is essential if recurrence is to be avoided. Some have combined this procedure with bypass grafting.

Although five-year survival rates are high, cases of myocardial infarction, ventricular tachyarrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death have been reported. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Myocardial bridging and cardiac ischemia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medical therapies with beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, intracoronary stents, and surgery have all been used to improve symptoms.
