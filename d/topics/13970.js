PTSD is characterized by intrusive thoughts, nightmares and flashbacks of past traumatic events, avoidance of reminders of trauma, hypervigilance, and sleep disturbance, all of which lead to considerable social, occupational, and interpersonal dysfunction.</p><p>The diagnosis of PTSD can be challenging because of the heterogeneity of the presentation and resistance on the part of the patient to discuss past trauma. Another complicating factor is that traumatic events are associated with a range of other psychopathology including depression and anxiety disorders. Patients exposed to multiple traumatic events may be mistakenly diagnosed with PTSD rather than another primary disorder.</p><p>The epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, course, and diagnosis of PTSD are discussed here. Pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy of PTSD are discussed separately.

The rates of PTSD are similar among men and women after events such as accidents (6.3 versus 8.8 percent), natural disasters (3.7 versus 5.4 percent), and sudden death of a loved one (12.6 versus 16.2 percent). The incidence of PTSD after rape is higher in men compared with women (65 versus 46 percent), even though women are more than 10 times as likely as men to be raped. The rate of PTSD is lower in men compared with women after events such as molestation (12.2 versus 26.5 percent) and physical assault (1.8 versus 21.3 percent).</p><p>Higher rates of PTSD have been found in population subgroups in the United States compared with the general population, including Native Americans living on reservations and refugees from countries where traumatic stress was endemic.

Risk factors for PTSD symptoms were benzodiazepine use, early memories of frightening ICU experiences, and pre-ICU comorbid psychopathology.

Patients with PTSD, however, experience marked cognitive, affective, and behavioral responses to stimuli, leading to flashbacks, severe anxiety, and fleeing or combative behavior. These individuals compensate for such intense arousal by attempting to avoid experiences that may begin to elicit symptoms; this can result in emotional numbing, diminished interest in everyday activities, and, in the extreme, may result in detachment from others.</p><p>There are important distinguishing characteristics of PTSD symptoms in patients who experienced most of their trauma in childhood (eg, physical and sexual abuse) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

It can be difficult in some cases for clinicians to differentiate PTSD symptoms in patients presenting with borderline personality disorder (BPD).
