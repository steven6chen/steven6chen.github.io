This is essentially a &quot;normal&quot; finding and evaluation for other causes thrombocytopenia is generally not necessary if there are no signs of overt bleeding. Patients should be monitored to ensure platelet counts recover back to normal levels. The platelet count nadir typically occurs between one to four days after surgery and counts usually increase back to presurgery levels within a week to 10 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-thrombocytopenia-in-children/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].

In patients with these disorders, increased binding between larger von Willebrand factor multimers and platelets leads to the formation of small platelet aggregates, which are cleared from the circulation resulting in a lower platelet count.
