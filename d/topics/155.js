It is an autosomal dominant condition caused by mutations in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (<em>FGFR3</em>) gene. The most salient clinical features include disproportionate short stature (adult height is approximately 4 feet), long bone shortening that predominantly affects the proximal aspects of the upper and lower extremities (rhizomelic shortening), and macrocephaly. Patients with achondroplasia may have delayed motor development early on, but cognition is normal. There are a number of medical issues associated with this disorder.</p><p>The clinical findings, diagnosis, treatment options, and anticipatory guidance are discussed in this topic review. An overview of the diagnostic approach to skeletal dysplasias is presented in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=skeletal-dysplasias-approach-to-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Skeletal dysplasias: Approach to evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1745448326\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with achondroplasia have gain-of-function mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (<em>FGFR3</em>) gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achondroplasia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Two specific mutations in the <em>FGFR3</em> gene account for almost all cases of achondroplasia. These mutations occur at the same nucleotide in the <em>FGFR3</em> gene, 1138G&gt;A (98 percent) and 1138G&gt;C (1 percent), in both cases resulting in a glycine-to-arginine substitution in amino acid 380 (p.Gly380Arg) in the transmembrane domain of the <em>FGFR3</em> gene. This mutation permanently activates the FGFR3 receptor, inhibiting chondrocyte proliferation, which ultimately leads to impaired endochondral bone formation, growth restriction, bone shortening, and other skeletal anomalies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achondroplasia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2360846325\"><span class=\"h1\">INHERITANCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Achondroplasia is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner. Approximately 80 percent of cases are the result of new (de novo) mutations, while the remaining are inherited. When both parents have achondroplasia, the risk to their children of having homozygous achondroplasia (a lethal condition) is 25 percent and of having achondroplasia is 50 percent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1320918896\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Achondroplasia is characterized by distinctive craniofacial features, disproportionate short stature with rhizomelic shortening of the arms and the legs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F108746\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef108746 \">picture 1</a>), brachydactyly (shortening of the fingers and toes) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F108747\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef108747 \">picture 2</a>), kyphoscoliosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F51638\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51638 \">figure 1</a>), and accentuated lumbar lordosis. The craniofacial features and bone shortening are clearly present at birth. The craniofacial features include macrocephaly, frontal bossing, and midface retrusion. The nose is flattened out, often referred to as saddle nose deformity. The kyphoscoliosis can be seen from birth through infancy and typically decreases once the child starts to bear weight and ambulate. The lumbar lordosis is typically seen after ambulation starts at approximately 1.5 years of age.</p><p>The chest is often narrow. The back displays kyphosis of the thoracolumbar junction, which is prominent during the first year of life and mostly resolves as the spine straightens, the muscle tone improves, and the child starts walking. Exaggerated lumbar lordosis is a common finding that becomes prominent after walking begins (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F108746\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef108746 \">picture 1</a>). The lumbar spine may become stenotic at a later age, typically not until after the second and third decades (most often as an adult).</p><p>The extremities have shortening that is more pronounced in the <span class=\"nowrap\">proximal/rhizomelic</span> segments (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F108746\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef108746 \">picture 1</a>). Because of this, children with achondroplasia often have redundant skin folds that are most noticeable in their upper extremities. The elbows may have limitations, primarily affecting extension and oftentimes limiting complete supination. The hands show short fingers with a trident appearance of the hands secondary to short metacarpal bones (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F108747\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef108747 \">picture 2</a>). Joint laxity is common. The knees often have varus deformities, initially due to joint laxity and later on secondary to tibial bowing and fibular overgrowth.</p><p>Achondroplasia is associated with slow motor development (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F108610\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef108610 \">figure 2</a>). These children hold their head at approximately 4 to 7 months of age, sit alone at 9 to 11 months, crawl at 9 to 10 months, and walk alone by 16 to 22 months. The delay in these motor milestones is the result of a combination of joint laxity and a large head to support [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achondroplasia/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. These delays resolve by age two to three years provided no other medical problems exist, such as cervical medullary compression.

The evaluation and diagnosis of a short fetal femur is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-prenatal-diagnosis-of-the-lethal-skeletal-dysplasias\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to prenatal diagnosis of the lethal skeletal dysplasias&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Radiographs are suggested if achondroplasia is suspected after birth based upon clinical manifestations including distinct craniofacial features and bone shortening. The most useful radiographs are the anteroposterior (AP) view of the thorax and pelvis to look for the lack of widening of the interpedicular distances of the vertebral bodies, iliac abnormalities, and shortening of the long bones with metaphyseal abnormalities and hand films to look for shortening, brachydactyly, and trident deformity.</p><p>The diagnosis is confirmed by molecular testing. Most laboratories offer targeted testing for classical 1138 mutation in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (<em>FGFR3</em>) gene. Broader sequencing of the <em>FGFR3</em> gene, including multiple exons or the full gene, is suggested if the clinical diagnosis is in doubt and other conditions such as hypochondroplasia are suspected. Parents should consult with a geneticist during the initial evaluation to discuss diagnosis, recurrence risk, and prenatal testing, when applicable. (See <a href=\"#H1320918896\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1635901666\" class=\"local\">'Radiographic findings'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1745448326\" class=\"local\">'Genetics'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4032429524\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4032429524\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several other skeletal disorders that are also caused by mutations in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (<em>FGFR3</em>) gene (allelic diseases). These conditions share many of the clinical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiologic features seen in patients with achondroplasia, although each has its own distinctive features.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3043536301\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypochondroplasia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This condition is caused by <em>FGFR3 </em>mutations at nucleotide c.1620C&gt;A or C&gt;G that result in an N540K change (asparagine to lysine) in the intracellular domain. Hypochondroplasia is characterized by short stature, rhizomelic limb shortening, and brachydactyly but no macrocephaly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achondroplasia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The clinical presentation is milder, with more proportionate features, although the radiographic skeletal findings are still similar.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1696276001\"><span class=\"h2\">Thanatophoric dysplasia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This disorder is caused by mutations in the intracellular and extracellular domains of the <em>FGFR3</em> gene. These patients have similar but more severe findings than achondroplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achondroplasia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. There are two types of thanatophoric dysplasia. Type I is distinguished by bowed femurs and flatten vertebral bodies (platyspondyly) that are under-ossified. Type II is characterized by straight femurs and a severe craniosynostosis (termed a cloverleaf skull due to the shape of the deformity) that is caused by premature intrauterine closure of the coronal, sagittal, and lambdoid sutures. Both types of patients exhibit extremely short limbs, a very short and narrow chest with underdeveloped lungs, macrocephaly with frontal bossing and hypertelorism, and severe cervical medullary compression leading to early death.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4192081693\"><span class=\"h2\">Homozygous achondroplasia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Homozygous achondroplasia results from transmission of the <em>FGFR3</em> mutation from both parents who have achondroplasia. Clinically, this presents as a severe form of achondroplasia resembling the bone changes seen in thanatophoric dysplasia. Most with this disorder are stillborn or die in early infancy. Patients who survive the neonatal period die in the first few years of life due to pulmonary hypoplasia and respiratory failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achondroplasia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3942080837\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complications associated with achondroplasia include recurrent otitis media, obstructive sleep apnea, obesity, leg bowing, narrowing of the lumbar spine, and cervical medullary compression.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Recurrent otitis media</strong> &ndash; Patients with achondroplasia have a narrow auditory canal that contributes to recurrent ear infections.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Obstructive sleep apnea</strong> &ndash; Midface retrusion in conjunction with adenoid and tonsil enlargement can reduce the airway space, leading to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). OSA is clinically manifested by loud snoring, breath holding during sleep (apnea), poor sleep, poor school performance, and behavioral problems in some cases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Obesity</strong> &ndash; This is a common occurrence in achondroplasia that ultimately can negatively impact knee joints and lower spine in older individuals, worsen sleep apnea, and potentially lead to hypertension and diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achondroplasia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Leg bowing</strong> &ndash; Most children with achondroplasia have leg bowing (genu varum) during the first years of life secondary to joint laxity. The early bowing is typically followed conservatively. The leg bowing in later childhood, typically after five to six years of age, can be the result of tibial bowing and fibular overgrowth. The bowing can interfere with ambulation, causing stress in the joints and subsequent pain in the knees and ankles and, in some cases, tripping and frequent falling.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Spinal stenosis</strong> &ndash; Narrowing of the lumbar spine can occur in patients after their second or third decades. Typical presenting symptoms include claudication and bladder dysfunction. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies and a thorough neurologic exam are important to making the diagnosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cervical medullary compression</strong> &ndash; One area of controversy in achondroplasia is the prevalence and management of cervical medullary compression due to narrowing of the foramen magnum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achondroplasia/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. It is estimated that 5 to 10 percent of patients with achondroplasia develop true cervical medullary stenosis even though some degree of narrowing occurs in many more. Cervical medullary compression is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, including an increased risk of sudden infant death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achondroplasia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The maximum anatomical narrowing occurs at approximately 12 months of age. Thus, all infants should have computed tomography (CT) or MRI of the cervical medullary junction for surveillance around that time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Signs of narrowing of the cervical medullary junction should be closely followed, but rushing to surgical intervention should be avoided in the absence of other clinical findings. Warning signs for compression include motor delay that is more severe, persists in time, or is associated with an abnormal neurologic exam. Other concerning findings include clonus, hyperreflexia of the lower limbs, central <span class=\"nowrap\">apnea/hypopnea,</span> and a rapidly growing head circumference. A thorough evaluation should be performed to rule out cervical medullary compression, and urgent referral to a neurosurgeon should be initiated if any of these findings are present. It is best if these evaluations and surgical decisions involve a multidisciplinary team including geneticists, orthopedists, neurologists, and neurosurgeons.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">This evaluation includes a complete neurologic assessment, CT scan of the head with foramen magnum measurements, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow studies of the cervical spine done with MRI with flexion-extension images, somatic-sensory evoked potentials (SSEPs), and sleep studies to assess sleep apnea. Most groups do not recommend routine CT or MRI studies.</p><p/><p>MRI studies with T2-weighed images in conjunction with flow studies can be valuable in assessing cord compression. Lack of flow anteriorly and posteriorly suggests compression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achondroplasia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In the experience of some groups, however, a decreased space around the cord in the cervical medullary junction and extra-axial fluid accumulation in the brain around the parietal and temporal areas, as well as occipital bone impingement of the posterior cord, can be seen in patients with achondroplasia with no neurologic sequela [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achondroplasia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H418443552\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management of achondroplasia focuses on maximizing functional capacity and monitoring, preventing, and treating complications.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Developmental delay</strong> &ndash; Physical therapy is appropriate for those children who present with delayed motor milestones in the first two years of life.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Activities of daily living</strong> &ndash; The limb shortening can interfere with daily self-care tasks such as reaching out, feeding, bathing, dressing, and independent toileting and self-care. Thus, adaptive arrangements are very important. An example is adapting furniture used in the home and school environment, such as using lower chairs and desks or using stools to reach the toilet seat or sink. In addition, hand extenders can be used for reaching objects or self-cleaning. Occupational therapy is also important for individuals with achondroplasia to achieve their best functional potential.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Growth</strong> &ndash; The linear growth (height) and head circumference should be plotted on the proper disease-specific growth curves (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F108608\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef108608 \">figure 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F108609\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef108609 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achondroplasia/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Failure to do so may result in unnecessary imaging studies. As an example, plotting the head of a child with achondroplasia on the regular growth curve may lead to extra brain imaging studies and potentially referrals to neurosurgery, with subsequent surgical procedures for suspected cervical medullary compression due to an apparent rapidly increasing head circumference.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Limb-lengthening surgery </strong>&ndash; Limb-lengthening surgeries have been used in the past and are resurging thanks to emerging surgical techniques. However, these therapies have a high financial and social cost. In the past, these surgeries were performed by surgical distractions of the long bones (humeri, femurs) followed by the use of external fixators (Ilizarov procedure) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achondroplasia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The best results with this technique were seen if it was performed after the completion of growth. This technique is being replaced by the use of rodding technologies that use limb distraction followed by implantation of intramedullary magnetic nails. The rods can then be stretched by the aid of powerful external magnets. The rods are used in place of external fixators that often led to infection, scarring, and other complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achondroplasia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. These surgeries can be performed in younger patients. Limb-lengthening surgery is still controversial among the little people community and opposed by most patient support groups.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Weight management</strong> &ndash; Avoiding obesity should be discussed early on. Proper nutrition and physical activity are important measures in preventing obesity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Otitis media</strong> &ndash; An aggressive approach to preventing and treating otitis media in infancy and childhood is required to avert problems related to speech development. In some instances, otolaryngology evaluation and placement of tympanostomy (pressure equalization [PE]) tubes are necessary in those children with recurrent otitis media.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Snoring and sleep apnea</strong> &ndash; Sleep studies are indicated in patients with snoring <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> suspected sleep apnea. Referral to otolaryngology for further evaluation and possible tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy is suggested if obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is confirmed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Leg bowing</strong> &ndash; The initial leg bowing due to joint laxity is addressed by physical therapy and rarely braces. Leg bowing after five to six years of age due to tibial bowing and fibular overgrowth requires frequent monitoring and, if needed, surgical intervention that may include osteotomies of the proximal fibula and epiphysiodesis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F108753\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef108753 \">image 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achondroplasia/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Standing lower leg radiographs can be performed by the primary care clinician. Orthopedic referral for evaluation and monitoring is recommended.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Spinal stenosis</strong> &ndash; Referral to neurosurgery or orthopedics is warranted if the diagnosis is confirmed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cervical medullary compression</strong> &ndash; Neurosurgical referral is indicated in children with suspected compression of the cervical medullary junction. Patients with cervical medullary compression should avoid contact sports, trampoline use, diving, and gymnastic exercises or other athletic activities that could aggravate the compression. Some providers recommend avoidance of the previously mentioned sports and physical activities in all children with achondroplasia. Those requiring decompression surgery typically undergo a suboccipital craniectomy, as well as posterior C1 and C2 laminectomies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Perioperative complications</strong> &ndash; Patients with skeletal dysplasia such as achondroplasia are at increased risk for perioperative morbidity and mortality due to abnormalities of their upper airway, chest wall, and upper cervical spine. Complications include neural compression and difficulty with intubation and securing of the airway. A best practices report from a multidisciplinary, international expert panel outlines recommendations for perioperative management of patients with skeletal dysplasia, with the goal of reducing complications and improving clinical outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achondroplasia/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Recommendations include preoperative pulmonary, cardiac, and neurologic evaluations and imaging of the cervical spine, as well as performance of surgeries at tertiary care centers that have the expertise to manage these patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pregnancy</strong> &ndash; Pregnant women with achondroplasia will require cesarean section for delivery due to their small pelvic size. In addition, a woman with achondroplasia has a 50 percent chance of having an affected child who will have macrocephaly, another clear indication for a cesarean section.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2558816406\"><span class=\"h1\">RESOURCES FOR PATIENTS AND FAMILIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Networking through groups such as the <a href=\"http://www.lpaonline.org/&amp;token=Xil6xtKCjfvO6dJxLYgKQ8sZmO3URuIWQdzIbZ1E+VLEtie2Bkdfo0ULRRM3Vypj&amp;TOPIC_ID=103825\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Little People of America</a> is very important for families of children with achondroplasia and the patients themselves as they get older.

It is the most common bone dysplasia in humans. (See <a href=\"#H4051549870\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1745448326\" class=\"local\">'Genetics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical manifestations include distinctive craniofacial features, disproportionate short stature with rhizomelic shortening of the arms and the legs, brachydactyly, kyphoscoliosis, and accentuated lumbar lordosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F108746\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef108746 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F108747\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef108747 \">picture 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1320918896\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnosis is based on typical clinical findings. Radiologic findings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F108749\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef108749 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F108750\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef108750 \">image 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F108754\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef108754 \">image 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F108748\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef108748 \">image 4</a>), as well as molecular testing, can confirm diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H1635901666\" class=\"local\">'Radiographic findings'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4032429524\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis includes hypochondroplasia, thanatophoric dysplasia, and homozygous achondroplasia. (See <a href=\"#H4032429524\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Careful monitoring is needed to assess for potential complications including cervical medullary cord compression in infancy, recurrent otitis media, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), leg bowing, and lumbosacral spinal stenosis in older individuals. (See <a href=\"#H3942080837\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of achondroplasia focuses on maximizing functional capacity and monitoring, preventing, and treating complications. An alternative approach to correct the molecular defect and the developmental bone abnormalities caused by the <em>FGFR3</em> defects is under investigation. (See <a href=\"#H418443552\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above and <a href=\"#H407127979\" class=\"local\">'Experimental drug therapies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Narrowing of the cervical medullary junction in infants should be closely followed, but rushing to surgical intervention should be avoided in the absence of other clinical findings. (See <a href=\"#H3942080837\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/achondroplasia/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Shiang R, Thompson LM, Zhu YZ, et al.
