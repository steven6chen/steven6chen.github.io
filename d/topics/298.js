(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=traumatic-brain-injury-epidemiology-classification-and-pathophysiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Traumatic brain injury: Epidemiology, classification, and pathophysiology&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Mild TBI is typically defined as mild by a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 13 to 15, measured at approximately 30 minutes after the injury (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F81854\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81854 \">table 1</a>). Some recommend classifying patients with a GCS score of 13 as moderate head injury (defined as GCS score of 9 to 12) because they seem more similar with regard to prognosis and incidence of intracranial abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mild-traumatic-brain-injury-concussion-in-adults/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>].</p><p>The term &quot;concussion&quot; is often used in the medical literature as a synonym for mild TBI, but is used more specifically to describe the characteristic symptoms and signs that an individual may experience after a mild TBI. The Quality Standards Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology defines concussion as a trauma-induced alteration in mental status that may or may not involve loss of consciousness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mild-traumatic-brain-injury-concussion-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Definitions of mild <span class=\"nowrap\">TBI/concussion</span> often do not explicitly require a normal head computed tomography (CT). A minority of patients who present with mild TBI are found to have significant intracranial abnormalities, including contusion and hemorrhage (subarachnoid, subdural, epidural, or intracerebral), either at presentation or at follow-up. When these are identified, patients may no longer be considered to have mild TBI as their primary diagnosis but are more appropriately diagnosed and managed according to the identified lesion (eg, acute subdural hemorrhage). However, such patients may still be subject to other sequelae of mild TBI. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postconcussion-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postconcussion syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sequelae-of-mild-traumatic-brain-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sequelae of mild traumatic brain injury&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 2.5 million people sustain a TBI in the United States every year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mild-traumatic-brain-injury-concussion-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Most, 75 to 95 percent, are mild [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mild-traumatic-brain-injury-concussion-in-adults/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. The annual incidence of mild head injury per 100,000 population has been estimated to be 131 for San Diego County, California [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mild-traumatic-brain-injury-concussion-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]; 149 for Olmsted County, Minnesota [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mild-traumatic-brain-injury-concussion-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]; and 749 for Auckland, New Zealand [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mild-traumatic-brain-injury-concussion-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, the incidence of mild head injury may be significantly higher, as many cases go unreported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mild-traumatic-brain-injury-concussion-in-adults/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p>For an industrialized country such as the United States, estimates of the relative causes of TBI are as follows: motor vehicle accidents (20 to 45 percent), falls (30 to 38 percent), occupational accidents (10 percent), recreational accidents (10 percent), and assaults (5 to 17 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mild-traumatic-brain-injury-concussion-in-adults/abstract/11,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,14</a>]. In older adults, falls are more likely the cause, and motor vehicle accidents are more common in the young.</p><p>Mild TBI also occurs in contact sports; American football, ice hockey, soccer, boxing, and rugby have a particularly high incidence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mild-traumatic-brain-injury-concussion-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The annual incidence of sports-related concussion in the United States is 1.6 to 3.8 million, and the likelihood of an athlete in a contact sport experiencing a concussion is as high as 20 percent per season [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mild-traumatic-brain-injury-concussion-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In football alone, an estimated 10 percent of United States college and 20 percent of United States high school players sustain brain injuries each season [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mild-traumatic-brain-injury-concussion-in-adults/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>].</p><p>Mild TBI is also a common injury among soldiers who have participated in combat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mild-traumatic-brain-injury-concussion-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In a survey of 2525 Army infantry soldiers performed three to four months after their return from a one-year deployment in Iraq, 5 percent reported injuries with loss of consciousness and 10 percent reported injuries with altered consciousness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mild-traumatic-brain-injury-concussion-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The mechanisms of injury (in order of frequency) included blasts or explosions, falls, motor vehicle accidents, and fragment, shrapnel, and bullet wounds.</p><p>Males are more commonly head-injured, with a ratio between 2.0:1 and 2.8:1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mild-traumatic-brain-injury-concussion-in-adults/abstract/8,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,11</a>]. This likely reflects the greater participation of men in high-risk activities that lead to TBIs. Approximately one-half of all patients with mild TBI are between the ages of 15 and 34 years. Patients at moderate risk include those less than 5 years and those over 60 years. Lower socioeconomic status, lower cognitive function, and a history of hospital admissions for intoxications are also risk factors for head injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mild-traumatic-brain-injury-concussion-in-adults/abstract/8,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,21</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mild TBI results from direct external contact forces or from the brain being slapped against intracranial surfaces with <span class=\"nowrap\">acceleration/deceleration</span> trauma. Concussion may result in neuropathologic changes, but the acute clinical symptoms are believed to reflect a disturbance of function rather than structural injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mild-traumatic-brain-injury-concussion-in-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p>Mild TBI may result in cortical contusions due to coup and contrecoup injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mild-traumatic-brain-injury-concussion-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. While axonal rupture from shear and tensile forces can occur at the time of severe head injury, milder degrees of axonal damage are postulated to play a role in mild TBI. Disruption of axonal neurofilament organization impairs axonal transport, leading to axonal swelling, Wallerian degeneration, and transection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mild-traumatic-brain-injury-concussion-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Release of excitatory neurotransmitters acetylcholine, glutamate, and aspartate, and the generation of free radicals may contribute to secondary injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mild-traumatic-brain-injury-concussion-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. One somewhat controversial theory regarding blast trauma is that the transfer of kinetic energy through the vascular system to the brain can lead to TBI in the absence of a direct head injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mild-traumatic-brain-injury-concussion-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>That these processes occur in mild TBI is supported by findings in animal models of brain injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mild-traumatic-brain-injury-concussion-in-adults/abstract/24,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,27</a>]. Evidence of microscopic axonal injury, axon retraction bulbs, and microglial clusters has also been described in the pathologic examination of patients with minor head injury who died of other injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mild-traumatic-brain-injury-concussion-in-adults/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. Diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies in patients with mild TBI demonstrate increased fractional anisotropy and decreased diffusivity in the corpus callosum and other white matter tracts that is suggestive of cytotoxic edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mild-traumatic-brain-injury-concussion-in-adults/abstract/30-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-33</a>]. Functional MRI studies demonstrate additional abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mild-traumatic-brain-injury-concussion-in-adults/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. Imaging studies have shown that patients with mild head injury may have more frequent and more extensive areas of abnormality as measured by Technetium-99m (Tc-99m) hexamethylpropylene amine oxime single-photon emission computed tomography (HMPAO SPECT), fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET), computed tomography (CT) perfusion, and MRI than can be seen on a conventional noncontrast CT, supporting a role for diffuse structural <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> physiologic derangement in mild TBI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mild-traumatic-brain-injury-concussion-in-adults/abstract/36-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-42</a>]. The advanced neuroimaging techniques described above may one day be helpful in identifying sequelae of TBI when conventional noncontrast CT and MRI are normal; however, the data currently available for the use of these techniques are insufficient for clinical use and application to individual patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mild-traumatic-brain-injury-concussion-in-adults/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2195158\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute symptoms and signs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hallmark symptoms of concussion are confusion and amnesia, sometimes with, but often without, preceding loss of consciousness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mild-traumatic-brain-injury-concussion-in-adults/abstract/1,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,44</a>]. These symptoms may be apparent immediately after the head injury or may appear several minutes later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mild-traumatic-brain-injury-concussion-in-adults/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. It is important to emphasize that the alteration in mental status characteristic of concussion can occur without loss of consciousness. In fact, the majority of concussions in sports occur without loss of consciousness and are often unrecognized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mild-traumatic-brain-injury-concussion-in-adults/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>The amnesia almost always involves loss of memory for the traumatic event and frequently includes loss of recall for events immediately before (retrograde amnesia) and after (anterograde amnesia) the head trauma. An athlete with amnesia may be unable to recall details about recent plays in the game or details of current events. Amnesia also may be evidenced by the patient repeatedly asking a question that has already been answered. </p><p>Other early symptoms of concussion include headache, dizziness (vertigo or imbalance), lack of awareness of surroundings, and nausea and vomiting; these may immediately follow the head trauma or evolve gradually over several minutes to hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mild-traumatic-brain-injury-concussion-in-adults/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Over the next hours and days, patients may also complain of mood and cognitive disturbances, sensitivity to light and noise, and sleep disturbances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mild-traumatic-brain-injury-concussion-in-adults/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>While many concussions occur without observed findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mild-traumatic-brain-injury-concussion-in-adults/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>], signs observed in someone with a concussion may include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mild-traumatic-brain-injury-concussion-in-adults/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grossly observable incoordination (stumbling, inability to walk <span class=\"nowrap\">tandem/straight</span> line)</p><p/><p>As well as neuropsychiatric impairments, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vacant stare (befuddled facial expression)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delayed verbal expression (slower to answer questions or follow instructions)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inability to focus attention (easily distracted and unable to follow through with normal activities)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disorientation (walking in the wrong direction, unaware of time, date, place)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Slurred or incoherent speech (making disjointed or incomprehensible statements)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Emotionality out of proportion to circumstances (appearing distraught, crying for no apparent reason)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Memory deficits (exhibited by patient repeatedly asking the same question that has already been answered or inability to recall three of three words after five minutes)</p><p/><p>Occasionally, associated transient neurologic deficits, such as global amnesia or cortical blindness, can occur. The pathogenesis underlying these symptoms is not well understood; it is speculated that vascular hyperreactivity and trauma-induced, migraine-equivalent phenomena may play a role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mild-traumatic-brain-injury-concussion-in-adults/abstract/48-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-50</a>].</p><p>Less common are cranial nerve deficits such as extraocular muscle weakness, vertigo, and nystagmus.

These should be evaluated independently. A stroke syndrome, in particular, raises suspicion for traumatic vascular injury, while paraparesis or paraplegia suggests spinal cord injury. These presentations and their evaluation and management are discussed separately in individual topic reviews.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Seizures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early post-traumatic seizures are those that occur within the first week after head injury. These seizures are considered to be acute symptomatic events and not epilepsy. Post-traumatic seizures occur in less than 5 percent of mild or moderate TBI, and they are more common with more severe TBI, especially if complicated by intracranial hematoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mild-traumatic-brain-injury-concussion-in-adults/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>].</p><p>Approximately half occur within the first 24 hours of the injury; one-quarter occur within the first hour [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mild-traumatic-brain-injury-concussion-in-adults/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>]. The earlier a seizure begins, the more likely it will be generalized in onset; after the first hour more than half are either simple partial (pure motor) seizures or focal with secondary generalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mild-traumatic-brain-injury-concussion-in-adults/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>]. </p><p>Early post-traumatic seizures increase the risk of post-traumatic epilepsy by fourfold, to more than 25 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mild-traumatic-brain-injury-concussion-in-adults/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. While antiseizure drugs may be used in the treatment of early seizures, they are not helpful in the prevention of post-traumatic epilepsy.

However, mild TBI can be complicated in 6 to 10 percent of cases by existent cortical contusions and the development of intracranial hemorrhage, which may be intracerebral, subdural, epidural, or subarachnoid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mild-traumatic-brain-injury-concussion-in-adults/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Worse functional outcomes are seen in patients with mild TBI with imaging evidence of intracranial injury when compared with those without [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mild-traumatic-brain-injury-concussion-in-adults/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. </p><p>Brain contusions are areas of injury with associated localized ischemia, edema, and mass effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mild-traumatic-brain-injury-concussion-in-adults/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Signs of cortical contusions vary based on their number, size, and location within the brain but include focal neurologic signs as well as confusion and impaired consciousness. Brain contusions may delay recovery from a concussion.</p><p>Neurologic deterioration after mild TBI is highly suggestive of an evolving intracranial hematoma, which may be intracerebral, subdural, or epidural and usually occurs due to a tear in an intracranial artery or vein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mild-traumatic-brain-injury-concussion-in-adults/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Signs include worsening headache, focal neurologic signs, confusion, and lethargy, which may progress to loss of consciousness or even death. In the setting of substantive secondary hemorrhage with deterioration in the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), the TBI would be reclassified as moderate or severe.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subdural hemorrhage occurs when trauma results in the tearing of bridging veins or dura. The presentation may be acute, subacute, or chronic.

Head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) without contrast can be sensitive in detecting intracranial injury that is occult on CT, such as subtle blood products or secondary signs of injury like edema, but is not indicated for initial evaluation as the exam does not seem to impact the disposition of the patient. MRI is considered more appropriate for evaluating TBI in the subacute (eg, 8 to 89 days after injury) or chronic (eg, &gt;90 days after injury) setting, particularly when clinical symptoms persist.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2213225450\"><span class=\"h4\">Computed tomography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Head CT without contrast is recommended for imaging of patients with acute TBI, as it is the best modality to detect injuries that may require neurosurgical intervention.

In one large multicenter study, the initial CT scan had a 99.7 percent predictive value for excluding an injury requiring neurosurgical intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mild-traumatic-brain-injury-concussion-in-adults/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>].</p><p>Intravenous contrast is not routinely administered in evaluating patients with mild TBI but may be required to perform CT angiography (CTA) of the head and neck when vascular injury is suspected.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3359841500\"><span class=\"h4\">Magnetic resonance imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the acute setting, head MRI without contrast is usually not indicated for mild TBI. MRI is more sensitive than CT in detecting small amounts of parenchymal, subdural, and epidural hemorrhage; contusion; and posterior fossa, brainstem, and diffuse axonal injuries. MRI is generally less sensitive than CT at detecting subarachnoid hemorrhage. While MRI after CT reveals additional findings in up to one-third of patients, this additional information does not alter the initial patient triage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mild-traumatic-brain-injury-concussion-in-adults/abstract/37,99-101\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,99-101</a>]. However, in patients with a negative CT with persistent or progressive unexplained neurologic deficits, MRI can be used to evaluate for occult injury.

Most of these additional abnormalities were lesions &quot;consistent with axonal injury,&quot; but small contusions and subarachnoid hemorrhage have also been described. Some nonspecific magnetic resonance (MR) findings may be unrelated to TBI, and others do not clearly correlate with TBI severity or outcome; however, the presence of one or more brain contusions or foci of hemorrhagic axonal injury has been associated with poorer three-month outcomes (odds ratio [OR] 4.5 and 3.2, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-mild-traumatic-brain-injury-concussion-in-adults/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]. Nonetheless, as there is no specific treatment for these lesions, MRI is typically reserved for patients who do not recover as expected as well as for those with other unexplained focal neurologic deficits.

If follow-up imaging is necessary, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be preferred over CT because of its higher sensitivity for nearly all abnormalities and its lack of ionizing radiation. With patients in a head brace where hardware artifact will likely degrade image quality, CT may be the better choice. Timely availability and easy comparison with the prior study may also favor CT in this setting.

An athlete with known or suspected head injury should be evaluated by a trained observer for potential concussion. Simple orientation questions are inadequate to detect concussion. One suggested tool for nonmedically trained personnel is the Standardized Assessment of Concussion (SAC) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F77142\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77142 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H507487388\" class=\"local\">'Standardized examinations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who have suffered loss of consciousness or have persistent symptoms should be referred to an emergency department. At-risk patients should have a head computed tomography (CT) without contrast in the acute setting (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F50743\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef50743 \">algorithm 1</a>). Intravenous contrast administration for CT angiography (CTA) of the head and neck is sometimes required in patients where the noncontrast images suggest a vascular injury. (See <a href=\"#H456566293\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neurosurgical or neurologic evaluation is indicated if CT shows any of the following findings (see <a href=\"#H1992449588\" class=\"local\">'Management of complications and associated injuries'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Mass effect (basal cistern compression or midline shift), sulcal effacement, or herniation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Substantial epidural or subdural hematomas (&gt;1 cm in width, or causing mass effect)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Substantial cerebral contusion (&gt;1 cm in diameter, or more than one site)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Extensive subarachnoid hemorrhage, posterior fossa, intraventricular or bilateral hemorrhage</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Depressed or diastatic skull fracture</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pneumocephalus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cerebral edema</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some form of observation is recommended for at least 24 hours after a mild TBI because of the risk of intracranial complications; while the incidence is low, sequelae are potentially life threatening. Some patients may be safely monitored at home by a responsible caregiver, while inpatient observation is recommended for others (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F50743\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef50743 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Observation and disposition'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Follow-up imaging is indicated for those who experience clinical deterioration, and may also be appropriate for those with an initial abnormal CT <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> high-risk patients who are anticoagulated. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is more sensitive than CT for nearly all abnormalities, lacks ionizing radiation, and is thus preferred in most patients, in particular those with neurologic deficits that cannot be explained by the CT findings. In patients with suspected vascular injury, CT or magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the head and neck with intravenous contrast should also be performed. (See <a href=\"#H1419284693\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend that athletes NOT return to play the same day after concussion, and also that athletes NOT return to play until asymptomatic off medication (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). A more conservative approach is probably appropriate for children and adolescents. (See <a href=\"#H461317915\" class=\"local\">'Return to play for athletes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Follow-up imaging is indicated for those who experience clinical deterioration, and may also be appropriate for those with an initial abnormal CT <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> high-risk patients who are anticoagulated; head MRI is preferred over CT because of its higher sensitivity for nearly all abnormalities and its lack of ionizing radiation.
