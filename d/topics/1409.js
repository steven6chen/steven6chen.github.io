Depending on the immunologic defect present, a patient may respond poorly to one or both types. Vaccines serve as correlates of a patient's ability to mount a normal immune response and ward off a natural infection. Mechanisms of the normal immune responses to protein and polysaccharide antigens are reviewed elsewhere.

The response to the conjugate vaccine for Hemophilus influenzae type B (Hib), while it includes antibodies against Hemophilus influenza surface polysaccharide, is determined by the response to the protein component of the conjugate and thus represents a protein response.

To circumvent this, a few specialized centers have access to the bacteriophage Phi X174 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessing-the-immunologic-response-to-vaccination/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This is a &quot;neoantigen&quot; to which normal individuals have not been previously exposed and to which antibodies are not present in commercially available gammaglobulin products. The use of this bacteriophage typically requires special authorization and interpretation at research institutions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessing-the-immunologic-response-to-vaccination/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Rabies vaccines have also been used as neoantigens, although this practice cannot be recommended because the normal response has not been sufficiently established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessing-the-immunologic-response-to-vaccination/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Patterns of nonresponse</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two patterns of nonresponse are well-described:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An inability to respond effectively to polysaccharide antigens only (polysaccharide nonresponse)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An inability to respond effectively to both polysaccharide and protein antigens</p><p/><p>It is highly unusual for a patient to have an impaired response to protein antigens with a normal response to polysaccharide antigens.</p><p>The disorders in which each type of nonresponse is seen are reviewed below.

Evaluation includes immunization with the unconjugated polysaccharide vaccine to determine the ability to respond to serotypes present only in that vaccine.</p><p>If initial titers are not protective, a single dose of the vaccine is administered and postvaccination titers are measured four to eight weeks after vaccination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessing-the-immunologic-response-to-vaccination/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Recommendations for vaccination of adults in the United States are summarized in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F82634\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82634 \">figure 1</a>). Detailed discussions of the routine vaccination of children and adults are found separately.

The same assay method should be used to process pre- and postvaccination samples, and the assay should be standardized to World Health Organization (WHO) standards.</p><p>Methods for the measurement of antigen-specific antibodies include multiplex pneumococcal serology (Luminex), nephelometry, turbidimetry, radial immunodiffusion, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and radioimmunoassay. The method employed depends upon the laboratory and the antibody class or subclass being measured. Laboratories may determine their own reference ranges or use data provided by reagent manufacturers. ELISA or a similar immunologic assay is the preferred method [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessing-the-immunologic-response-to-vaccination/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Only immunoglobulin G (IgG) titers are relevant to the assessment of vaccine responses. Infections and immunizations elicit immunoglobulin M (IgM), immunoglobulin A (IgA), and immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody responses, although only IgG antibodies confer long-term protection and are considered indicative of immunity. The IgG level represents the total of all IgG subclasses, since most antibody measurement tests do not differentiate among immunoglobulin subclasses.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7368968\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing of pre- and postvaccination measurements</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Four to eight weeks should be allowed after vaccination before measuring postvaccination titers. Assessing responses earlier than this may result in low titers. Longer periods (eg, 6 to 12 months), are also less informative, because when antibody concentrations are low after longer periods, it is not possible to differentiate patients who did not respond at all from those who did but subsequently lost the antibodies over time (ie, specific antibody deficiency versus poor immunologic memory).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Interfering factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The immunologic response to vaccination cannot be reliably evaluated in patients who have received gammaglobulin replacement within the past five to six months, or in those who have received single doses of immunoglobulins for prevention of specific infections (eg, hepatitis A or measles) within the past three to five months, since the antibodies assessed may be either of donor or patient origin. Most clinical immunologists wait at least four months after discontinuing gammaglobulin therapy to revaccinate patients for evaluation.</p><p>Other conditions and treatments that potentially interfere with immunoglobulin production and vaccine response include cancer, chemotherapy, and some immunosuppressive therapies (eg, long-term glucocorticoids, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>, etc). These are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondary-immunodeficiency-induced-by-biologic-therapies#H447874294\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondary immunodeficiency induced by biologic therapies&quot;, section on 'Impact on vaccination'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucocorticoid-effects-on-the-immune-system\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glucocorticoid effects on the immune system&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSESSING RESPONSE TO PROTEIN ANTIGENS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tetanus and diphtheria toxoids are protein antigens. Titers of specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies can be measured in vaccinated children and adults to evaluate immune responsiveness to protein antigens. The antibody responses generated by these vaccines are largely (but not exclusively) composed of IgG1 and IgG3 antibodies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Tetanus and diphtheria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children normally receive the diphtheria-tetanus-acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine series, which contains both diphtheria and tetanus toxoids, beginning at two months of age. Antidiphtheria and antitetanus toxoid antibodies should be measured only after a series of three immunizations has been completed, usually after six months of age. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphtheria-tetanus-and-pertussis-immunization-in-infants-and-children-0-through-6-years-of-age#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis immunization in infants and children 0 through 6 years of age&quot;, section on 'Routine schedule'</a>.)</p><p>In adults, a booster of tetanus and diphtheria is recommended every 10 years, although compliance is variable (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F82634\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82634 \">figure 1</a>). It is therefore common to find nonprotective levels, particularly to diphtheria, in healthy adults without immune problems. It is not uncommon for normal adults to have low diphtheria titers in the setting of a protective tetanus titer. In a representative cross-sectional survey of individuals in the United States examined between 1988 and 1994, only 47 percent of adults over the age of 20 had protective antibody titers to both organisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessing-the-immunologic-response-to-vaccination/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Protective titers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The protective level for diphtheria is 0.01 to 0.1 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> and for tetanus &gt;0.1 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessing-the-immunologic-response-to-vaccination/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. If postvaccination titers are above these levels, the patient's response to protein antigens is normal.</p><p>Low or borderline-low titers need to be considered in the context of the immunization history:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Titers of 0.1 international <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> in a patient immunized or reimmunized within a few months is probably not sufficient to document immunocompetence, as a higher titer would be expected shortly after vaccination. A booster dose can be given in this situation and titers reassessed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Borderline-low or low titers do not necessarily indicate an immune problem if the patient was vaccinated several years before. The exact timing of the decrease of antibodies to the minimum protective levels after vaccination has not been established. Therefore, if either tetanus or diphtheria titers are at the lower limit of protection and the patient was not recently vaccinated, a booster vaccine can be administered to confer increased protection to diphtheria and to further probe the immune response to protein antigens.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If a patient has frankly low titers to either tetanus or diphtheria, then a booster should be administered and titers reassessed.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Conjugate polysaccharide vaccines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conjugated vaccines contain polysaccharide antigens complexed to immunogenic proteins. These vaccines have limited use in assessing either protein or polysaccharide responses. Conjugate vaccines were developed because normal children under the age of two years are believed to generate weak responses to polysaccharide antigens alone. The antibody response to conjugate vaccines in young children is predominately stimulated by the protein component and therefore is not representative of either a pure polysaccharide response or a pure protein response. Therefore, in a patient who received a conjugate vaccine series, measurement of titers to the specific polysaccharides contained in the conjugate vaccine does not allow for an assessment of responsiveness to pure polysaccharide or protein antigens. Measurement of titers to the protein component of the conjugate vaccine, which is usually a diphtheria or tetanus toxoid, is similarly uninformative because these titers also reflect the patient's response to routine <span class=\"nowrap\">tetanus/diphtheria</span> vaccinations. (See <a href=\"#H31\" class=\"local\">'Nonresponse to conjugate polysaccharides'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Pneumococcal conjugate vaccine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children in the United States have been receiving conjugated vaccines for prophylaxis against Streptococcus pneumoniae since 2001. In 2010, the 7-valent Prevnar vaccine (containing serotypes 4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F) was replaced in the United States by a 13-valent Prevnar vaccine. This vaccine additionally includes serotypes 1, 3, 5, 6A, 7F, and 19A. Outside the United States, 10-valent conjugate vaccines are also in use, and these vaccines include serotypes that are present in the 13-valent Prevnar. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumococcal-streptococcus-pneumoniae-conjugate-vaccines-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pneumococcal (Streptococcus pneumoniae) conjugate vaccines in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Antibodies to the pneumococcal serotypes contained in the conjugate vaccine may be measured after the normal childhood immunization schedule is complete to assess protective immunity and responsiveness to protein-conjugated polysaccharide antigens. The presence of protective titers to the polysaccharides in conjugate vaccines indicates that the patient either has intact responses to conjugated polysaccharide antigens or has responded normally to natural infection.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Protective titers</strong> &ndash; A serotype-specific IgG concentration &ge;1.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">micrograms/mL</span> is considered protective in all age groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessing-the-immunologic-response-to-vaccination/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Hemophilus influenzae type B vaccine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children in the United States have been receiving conjugated vaccines for prophylaxis against Hemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) since the early 1990s. The conjugate vaccines used for immunization against Hib employ either diphtheria toxoid or the outer membrane protein complex of meningococcus as the immunogenic protein (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F64312\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64312 \">table 2</a>). Antibodies to the Hib capsular polysaccharide, polyribosylribitol phosphate (PRP), in patients who received the conjugated Hib vaccine reflect response to conjugated polysaccharide antigens, and so their presence does not rule out specific antibody deficiency to polysaccharide vaccines. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=specific-antibody-deficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Specific antibody deficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Protective titers</strong> &ndash; Anti-PRP IgG titers &ge;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">microgram/mL</span> are considered protective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessing-the-immunologic-response-to-vaccination/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSESSING POLYSACCHARIDE RESPONSES IN CHILDREN UNDER TWO YEARS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As previously mentioned, the use of pure polysaccharide vaccines in the evaluation of possible immunodeficiency is not recommended in children younger than two years of age who are still receiving their primary vaccination series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessing-the-immunologic-response-to-vaccination/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. There are two reasons for this:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Response to this type of vaccine is variable in children without an immune disorder. Some children with normal immune systems do not respond vigorously to polysaccharide antigens, while others do [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessing-the-immunologic-response-to-vaccination/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>]. Even children as young as six months of age appear to respond predictably well to certain serotypes (eg, serotype 3) and poorly to others (eg, serotype 14) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessing-the-immunologic-response-to-vaccination/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Polysaccharide responsiveness normally increases with age.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is some evidence that certain polysaccharide vaccines may interfere with the efficacy of conjugate vaccines given subsequently [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessing-the-immunologic-response-to-vaccination/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Isohemagglutinin testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Isohemagglutinins are antibodies that are normally generated in response to polysaccharides antigens from common gut bacteria. They generally appear in the blood by six months of age and can be measured in young patients who have not completed a primary vaccination series. Only the complete absence of isohemagglutinins after six months of age suggests a defect in antibody production and these are not routinely measured by most immunologists.</p><p>Isohemagglutinins are so named because these antibodies cross-react with A or B blood group erythrocyte antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessing-the-immunologic-response-to-vaccination/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Patients with type A blood should have anti-B isohemagglutinins and patients with blood type O should have both anti-A and anti-B. Patients with type AB blood do not have isohemagglutinins under normal circumstances. These tests are usually performed by local blood banks.</p><p>Titers of &ge;1:16 for anti-A, and &ge;1:8 for anti-B are normal. However, since this assessment measures combined titers of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and immunoglobulin M (IgM) for isohemagglutinins, it does not represent a pure IgG response to polysaccharide antigens. As a result, a normal titer does not necessarily indicate a robust polysaccharide response and therefore has limited utility.</p><p>Although isohemagglutinins are not routinely measured by most immunologists, their absence in an infant older than six months (who has type A, B, or O blood) can signify the presence of an immune defect that needs to be further investigated, such as that seen in severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID). However, the presence of isohemagglutinins does not exclude other less severe disorders, such as transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy (THI) or a hyperimmunoglobulin M syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=severe-combined-immunodeficiency-scid-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID): An overview&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transient-hypogammaglobulinemia-of-infancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperimmunoglobulin-m-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hyperimmunoglobulin M syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSESSING POLYSACCHARIDE RESPONSES IN ADULTS AND CHILDREN OVER TWO YEARS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Measurement of antibody titers to various serotypes of pneumococcus is the primary means of assessing responsiveness to polysaccharide antigens in adults and in children older than two years. In most cases, this is accomplished by measuring the patient's serum titers to the capsular polysaccharides in the polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine. There are two polysaccharide vaccines in widespread use (Pneumovax 23; Pnu-imune 23).</p><p>Immunoglobulin G (IgG) responses to pneumococcal serotypes in normal individuals of different ages across the general population have not been studied extensively, and so a solid definition of normal and abnormal antibody responses in different age groups is lacking.

Pneumococcal titers are generally measured in panels of multiple serotypes.

Panels of 23 serotypes are used in many settings.</p><p>Very specific laboratory standardization rules have been developed for the measurement of antipneumococcal polysaccharide antibodies that include absorption of patient sera with polysaccharide C and serotype 22F [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessing-the-immunologic-response-to-vaccination/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>It should be noted that the &ge;1.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">micrograms/mL</span> concentration has been agreed upon by consensus among clinical immunologists to be indicative of immunocompetence and protective against invasive pneumococcal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessing-the-immunologic-response-to-vaccination/abstract/1,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5</a>].

If an adult does not have protective levels to &ge;70 percent of serotypes when initially evaluated, then the Pneumovax 23 (PPV23) should be given and titers reassessed. Adults with normal immune responsiveness should achieve protective levels to &ge;70 percent of serotypes four to eight weeks after vaccination. In healthy adults less than 65 years of age, titers can drop to prevaccination levels within five years of receiving the polysaccharide vaccine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessing-the-immunologic-response-to-vaccination/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are few studies addressing the normal immune response of older adults (&gt;65 years of age) to PPV23.

Another study found that overall health status impacted the quantitative response to vaccines more than numeric age. One study found that in healthy adults older than 65 years of age, titers can drop to prevaccination levels within two years of receiving the vaccine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessing-the-immunologic-response-to-vaccination/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, another study showed that most titers persisted for at least five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessing-the-immunologic-response-to-vaccination/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

However, in adult patients who have high levels of antibodies to one or a few serotypes, but do not have protective levels to enough of the serotypes, immunization may result in an exaggerated local reaction that can last several days. We warn such patients about the possibility of a local reaction before administering the vaccine, and treat these reactions with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications when they occur.</p><p>For unimmunized adults, recommendations by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) changed in 2012. Recommendations are mentioned briefly in the next section and reviewed in more detail elsewhere.

Specifically, the conjugate vaccine should be administered first when possible. If the polysaccharide vaccine is also indicated, it should be given no sooner than eight weeks after the conjugate vaccine. This approach may result in stronger responses to the 13 serotypes present in PCV-13 and better immunologic memory, compared with administering the PPV23 first. Recommendations for pneumococcal vaccination in adults are reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumococcal-vaccination-in-adults#H770590020\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pneumococcal vaccination in adults&quot;, section on 'Schedule for dual vaccination'</a>.)</p><p>In patients that are being evaluated for an antibody deficiency syndrome, these recommendations impact the approach to pneumococcal vaccine challenge. One way to perform the evaluation and still adhere to the recommendations is to administer the conjugate vaccine (eg, PCV-13) first, followed in eight weeks by the polysaccharide vaccine (PPV23). Prevaccination titers can be obtained before either vaccine is given, and postvaccination titers can be obtained four or more weeks after the PPV23 was given. To assess the patient's response to polysaccharide antigens, only the serotypes that are exclusively in PPV23 are examined. The serotypes that are ONLY in the polysaccharide vaccine are: 2, 8, 9N, 10A, 11A, 12F, 15B, 17F, 20, 22F, 33F (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F77758\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77758 \">table 3</a>).

The higher the prevaccination titer for a specific serotype, the less likely that titer will increase significantly after vaccination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessing-the-immunologic-response-to-vaccination/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Information is limited about what degree of increase is normal for a titer that is already &gt;1.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">micrograms/mL</span> prior to vaccination. One study found that most children and adults can still increase individual titers by twofold, but fewer than 40 percent of patients increased their titers fourfold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessing-the-immunologic-response-to-vaccination/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. These data have been incorporated into the definitions of what constitutes a normal postvaccination response (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F91154\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91154 \">table 4</a>).</p><p>There is no response to a single serotype-specific polysaccharide that predicts the ability to or inability to respond to most or all of the other serotypes, and serotypes differ in immunogenicity. As an example, serotypes 6B and 23F are weak immunogens, whereas serotype 3 is highly immunogenic. An isolated but strong response to serotype 3 should not be interpreted as suggesting the patient's immune responsiveness is normal. Responses to all serotypes are considered equally.</p><p>Some patients who initially develop an adequate antibody response demonstrate a rapid decline in antibody titers over the ensuing year and remain susceptible to pneumococcal infections. Thus, retesting of antibody titers after 6 to 12 months is indicated in patients who responded appropriately to vaccination, but continue to get infections, to determine if a patient's titers have dropped to below protective levels in this time period.

The normal response to a &quot;booster&quot; dose has not been studied, and it is our experience that most patients who do not respond to the polysaccharide vaccine initially, also do not respond significantly to repeat doses either [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessing-the-immunologic-response-to-vaccination/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In addition, readministration of PPV23 may actually blunt the patient's response to subsequent natural exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessing-the-immunologic-response-to-vaccination/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p>There are two possible exceptions to the above generalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/assessing-the-immunologic-response-to-vaccination/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Young patients (two to five years of age) who demonstrated a poor response to the polysaccharide vaccine sometimes have a more vigorous response to a repeat dose given one to two years later.
