Multiple factors may contribute to the pathogenesis of FHA, including eating disorders (such as anorexia nervosa), exercise, and stress. Women in this group, which accounts for 5 to 10 percent of anovulatory women, usually have amenorrhea (although a range of menstrual dysfunction can be seen) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-ovulation-induction/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Biochemical findings include low serum estradiol concentrations and low or low-normal serum follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) concentrations due to presumed decreased hypothalamic secretion of GnRH. AMH levels are low to normal under these circumstances. Reversing the lifestyle factors that contribute to the anovulation (low weight, excessive exercise, essentially any condition that leads to energy deficiency) should be attempted before considering ovulation induction with medications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=functional-hypothalamic-amenorrhea-pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea: Pathophysiology and clinical manifestations&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-causes-of-secondary-amenorrhea\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and causes of secondary amenorrhea&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although rare, hypogonadotropic hypogonadism presenting as primary amenorrhea can be due to complete congenital GnRH deficiency.

In addition, women with PCOS should be screened for impaired glucose tolerance before starting ovulation induction because of the associated risk of pregnancy complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-ovulation-induction/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregestational-diabetes-mellitus-obstetrical-issues-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pregestational diabetes mellitus: Obstetrical issues and management&quot;</a>). There is ongoing debate regarding the use of ovulation induction versus assisted reproductive technologies (ART) for the treatment of infertile women with PCOS. According to the WHO guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-ovulation-induction/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], despite the widespread clinical use, little scientific evidence would currently support the use of ART as first-line treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary ovarian insufficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>POI, formerly referred to premature ovarian failure and defined as menopause before age 40 years, occurs in only 1 percent of all women but accounts for 5 to 10 percent of cases of anovulation. In most cases, the follicle pool is exhausted due to accelerated follicle loss of unknown origin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F74029\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74029 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-ovulation-induction/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Many strategies, including pretreatment suppression with exogenous estrogen, GnRH agonists, or androgens, have been proposed with the aim of improving outcomes from ovulation induction, but none have been successful. The only effective option is in vitro fertilization (IVF) with donor oocytes.

These women are anovulatory because hyperprolactinemia inhibits gonadotropin secretion, presumably by inhibiting GnRH. Most have oligomenorrhea or amenorrhea. Their serum gonadotropin concentrations are usually normal or decreased.

Preconception care is a broad term that refers to the process of identifying social, behavioral, environmental, and biomedical risks to a woman's fertility and pregnancy outcome and then reducing these risks through education, counseling, and appropriate intervention. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-preconception-office-visit\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The preconception office visit&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition to a medical history and physical examination, the preconception assessment includes an assessment of rubella immunity and additional laboratory assessment based upon individual risk factors and local guidelines.

AMH is expressed by the small (&lt;8 mm) preantral and early antral follicles, and serum concentrations reflect the size of the primordial follicle pool and may be the best biochemical marker of ovarian function across an array of clinical situations. AMH has been used as a predictor of in vitro fertilization (IVF) success; low levels correlate with reduced ovarian reserve and less than three follicles coinciding with poor IVF outcome, while high levels correlate with a vigorous response to ovarian stimulation and a higher risk of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-female-infertility#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of female infertility&quot;, section on 'Anti-m&uuml;llerian hormone (AMH)'</a>).

However, because clomiphene citrate is easy to administer, it may seem reasonable to give one course of clomiphene prior to initiating pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) or gonadotropin therapy. For those who ovulate, clomiphene citrate can then be continued. For those who do not ovulate, we suggest pulsatile GnRH as first-line therapy in countries where it is available. If pulsatile GnRH is unavailable, gonadotropin therapy should be initiated, with both luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) (these women do not respond to FSH alone).

Thus, the initial observation that fertility drug use was linked to epithelial ovarian cancer appears to be explained by the fact that these drugs are more likely to be used in infertile women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-ovulation-induction/abstract/49,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,59</a>]. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that nulliparous women with refractory infertility may harbor a particularly high risk of epithelial ovarian cancer, irrespective of their use of fertility drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-ovulation-induction/abstract/57,59-62\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,59-62</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The best evidence for a lack of association comes from a systematic review of 11 case-control studies and 14 cohort studies that included a total of 182,972 women. In this analysis, there was no convincing evidence of an excess risk of invasive ovarian tumors with fertility drug therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-ovulation-induction/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. However, there was a possible excess risk of borderline ovarian tumors in subfertile women undergoing in vitro fertilization (IVF), but there were methodological limitations, including a high risk of bias and small number of cases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Breast cancer </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>There does <strong>not</strong> appear to be an increased risk of breast cancer in women treated with fertility drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-ovulation-induction/abstract/52,53,63-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53,63-67</a>]. However, interpretation of the available data is limited by several factors, such as survey information, small subgroup numbers, lack of evaluation by drug <span class=\"nowrap\">type/dose</span> or cause of infertility, and confounding by the presence of other risk factors for breast cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=factors-that-modify-breast-cancer-risk-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Factors that modify breast cancer risk in women&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">One relatively large, case-control study showed that infertile women with breast cancer were more likely to have been treated with human menopausal gonadotropin (hMG) for more than six cycles than infertile women without breast cancer; no increased risk was noted for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomiphene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomiphene</a> citrate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-ovulation-induction/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. However, this study was subject to many of the limitations noted above.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In contrast, in a prospective cohort study of 116,671 women with 1357 incident cases of breast cancer, women who reported infertility due to an ovulatory disorder had a lower risk of breast cancer than women who did not report infertility (hazard ratio [HR] 0.75) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-ovulation-induction/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]; women who had received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomiphene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomiphene</a> citrate were at lowest risk (HR 0.60). In a sister-matched, case-control study among approximately 1400 women with and 1600 sisters without breast cancer, those who had used clomiphene citrate or exogenous follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) but did not conceive were at lower risk of breast cancer compared with nonusers (odds ratio [OR] 0.62, 95% CI 0.43-0.89). Those who used fertility drugs and did conceive (at least a 10-week pregnancy) had the same breast cancer risk as women who had never taken fertility drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-ovulation-induction/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Thus, women taking infertility drugs can be reassured that these drugs probably do not increase their risk of breast cancer, although it is not clear whether some subgroups may be at increased risk. Further investigation is required.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other ovulation induction drugs </strong>&ndash; Other ovulation induction therapies discussed below (including pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone [GnRH] and dopamine agonists) have not been linked to ovarian or breast cancer risk.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other cancers</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>In a retrospective, cohort study, neither <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomiphene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomiphene</a> nor gonadotropin use appeared to be associated with an increased risk of melanoma or thyroid, cervical, or colon cancers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-ovulation-induction/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. In contrast, the same investigators reported that clomiphene use may be associated with a greater risk of endometrial cancer. However, one explanation for these findings is that infertile women who used clomiphene were more likely to have underlying chronic anovulation, which is a strong risk factor for development of endometrial cancer, than infertile women not exposed to clomiphene. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ovulation-induction-with-clomiphene-citrate#H783713907\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ovulation induction with clomiphene citrate&quot;, section on 'Cancer risks'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Risk in offspring </strong>&ndash; A large, population-based study found that childhood tumor risk was not increased in children conceived following ovulation induction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-ovulation-induction/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. Ongoing monitoring of the long-term effects of these drugs is warranted since the number of cases was small. However, congenital malformation risk does not appear to be increased with oral ovulation induction agents (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ovulation-induction-with-clomiphene-citrate\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ovulation induction with clomiphene citrate&quot;</a>).

The goal of therapy in these women is monofollicular development and subsequent ovulation. This approach should be differentiated from stimulation of multiple follicle development in ovulatory women, as is done with assisted reproductive technologies (ART). (See <a href=\"#H523299831\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The method of ovulation induction selected by the clinician should be based upon the underlying cause of anovulation and the efficacy, costs, risks, burden of treatment, and potential complications associated with each method as they apply to the individual woman. (See <a href=\"#H523299831\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with hypogonadotropic amenorrhea, we suggest pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) as first-line therapy in women with intact pituitary function in countries where it is available (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Because <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomiphene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomiphene</a> citrate is easy to administer, it is reasonable to give one course of clomiphene prior to initiating pulsatile GnRH. However, very few women in this group respond. If pulsatile GnRH is unavailable, gonadotropin therapy should be initiated, with both luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) (these women do not respond to FSH alone). The low-dose, step-up regimen is considered to be the first-choice treatment. (See <a href=\"#H695051919\" class=\"local\">'Patient specific'</a> above and <a href=\"#H523298629\" class=\"local\">'Protocols'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomiphene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomiphene</a> citrate is the first-line infertility treatment for nonobese women. Some experts now suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=letrozole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">letrozole</a> as a first-line drug for obese women with PCOS. Of note, letrozole, is <strong>not </strong>approved for ovulation induction. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Aromatase inhibitors (letrozole)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Doses, regimens, and monitoring for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomiphene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomiphene</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=letrozole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">letrozole</a> use in women with PCOS are discussed in detail elsewhere (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ovulation-induction-with-clomiphene-citrate\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ovulation induction with clomiphene citrate&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ovulation-induction-with-letrozole\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ovulation induction with letrozole&quot;</a>). Other strategies are available as well for clomiphene-resistant patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If none of the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomiphene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomiphene</a> strategies are successful in women with PCOS, then gonadotropin therapy should be started (in this case, FSH alone is sufficient). Strict attention to follicle number is essential to avoid multiple gestation and ovarian hyperstimulation. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Gonadotropin therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To minimize the risk of multiple gestation and ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) in PCOS, gonadotropin treatment should be stopped if there are an excess number of follicles or extremely high serum estradiol concentrations. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with primary ovarian insufficiency (POI; premature ovarian failure) no ovulation induction strategy has been shown to be effective. However, in vitro fertilization (IVF) with donor oocytes has high success rates. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oocyte-donation-for-assisted-reproduction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oocyte donation for assisted reproduction&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with hyperprolactinemic anovulation, we suggest ovulation induction with dopamine agonists. We suggest either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bromocriptine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bromocriptine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cabergoline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cabergoline</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H523300123\" class=\"local\">'Dopamine agonists'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While there has been concern about a possible increased risk of ovarian cancer with ovulation induction drugs, it appears that the risk may be due to the infertility itself rather than the medications used to treat it. However, because one study suggested an increase after 12 cycles of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomiphene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomiphene</a> citrate, women should not receive more than 12 cycles. There does not appear to be an increased risk of breast cancer with ovulation induction drugs.
