The most common presenting symptom is dyspnea followed by chest pain (classically pleuritic but often dull) and cough. However, many patients, including those with large PE, have mild or nonspecific symptoms or are asymptomatic. For example, a meta-analysis of 19 studies (25,343 patients) found that clinical impression alone had a sensitivity and specificity of 85 and 51 percent, respectively, for the diagnosis of PE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-the-nonpregnant-adult-with-suspected-acute-pulmonary-embolism/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].Thus, it is critical that a high level of suspicion be maintained such that clinically relevant cases are not missed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H325664039\"><span class=\"h2\">History and examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common symptoms in patients with PE were identified in the Prospective Investigation of Pulmonary Embolism Diagnosis (PIOPED) group (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F66528\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66528 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-the-nonpregnant-adult-with-suspected-acute-pulmonary-embolism/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Dyspnea may be less frequent in older patients with no previous cardiopulmonary disease. Dyspnea is more likely to be present in patients who present with PE in the main or lobar vessels.</p><p>Approximately 10 percent of patients present with the symptoms of an infarcted lung, usually due to smaller, more peripheral emboli. Pleuritic pain is typical in this population due to inflammation of the pleura. Hemorrhage from the infarcted lung is also thought to be responsible for hemoptysis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-acute-pulmonary-embolism-in-adults#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of acute pulmonary embolism in adults&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis and pathophysiology'</a>.)</p><p>Retrospective studies report syncope as the presenting symptom in 10 percent or less of cases. Conversely, among those presenting with syncope, rates of PE ranging from 2 to 17 percent have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-the-nonpregnant-adult-with-suspected-acute-pulmonary-embolism/abstract/10-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-17</a>]. Highlighting syncope as a manifestation of PE, 560 patients seen in an emergency department (ED) with a first episode of syncope who were admitted to hospital underwent a rigorous investigation for PE that involved D-Dimer and computed tomography pulmonary arteriography (CTPA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-the-nonpregnant-adult-with-suspected-acute-pulmonary-embolism/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In this population, the prevalence of PE was 17 percent, higher in those who had no other identifiable etiology for syncope (25 percent). Although those discharged from the ED did not undergo formal evaluation for PE, when they were included in the analysis, the rate of PE was lower and closer to that seen in other retrospective studies (4 percent). Syncope may indicate a high burden of thrombus since up to two-thirds of patients with PE who present with syncope have large thrombi located in the mainstem or lobar arteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-the-nonpregnant-adult-with-suspected-acute-pulmonary-embolism/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. The reasons for syncope in patients with PE are poorly understood but may be partially explained by transient arrhythmias as thrombus travels through the heart or transient obstruction as the embolus transits the pulmonic valve. </p><p>Some patients have a delayed presentation over weeks or days. One prospective study reported that patients with a delayed presentation beyond one week tended to have larger, more centrally located PE compared with patients who presented within seven days (41 versus 26 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-the-nonpregnant-adult-with-suspected-acute-pulmonary-embolism/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Symptoms and signs of PE may also evolve over time such that patients who initially present with mild symptoms may become increasingly symptomatic or hemodynamically unstable, sometimes very quickly (minutes to hours). This may be secondary to recurrent embolization or progressive pulmonary hypertension secondary to vasoconstriction. Similarly, as a pulmonary infarct evolves, patients may develop progressive dyspnea, hypoxemia, pleuritic pain, and hemoptysis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-acute-pulmonary-embolism-in-adults#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of acute pulmonary embolism in adults&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis and pathophysiology'</a>.)</p><p>Importantly, symptoms may be mild or absent, even in large PE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-the-nonpregnant-adult-with-suspected-acute-pulmonary-embolism/abstract/3,6,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6,19</a>]. Although the true incidence of asymptomatic PE is unknown, one systematic review of 28 studies found that, among the 5233 patients who had a deep vein thrombosis (DVT), one-third also had asymptomatic PE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-the-nonpregnant-adult-with-suspected-acute-pulmonary-embolism/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Common presenting signs on examination include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-the-nonpregnant-adult-with-suspected-acute-pulmonary-embolism/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tachypnea (54 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Calf or thigh swelling, erythema, edema, tenderness, palpable cords (47 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tachycardia (24 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rales (18 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased breath sounds (17 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An accentuated pulmonic component of the second heart sound (15 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Jugular venous distension (14 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever, mimicking pneumonia (3 percent)</p><p/><p>Although upper extremity DVT (UEDVT) embolizes less commonly than lower extremity DVT, symptoms of UEDVT (eg, arm pain or tightness) should also raise the suspicion of PE.

Among such patients, either dyspnea or tachypnea is present in 91 percent. Massive PE may be accompanied by acute right ventricular failure manifested by increased jugular venous pressure, a right-sided third heart sound, a parasternal lift, cyanosis, and obstructive shock. However, shock may also develop in patients with smaller PE who have severe underlying pulmonary hypertension. A transition from tachycardia to bradycardia, or from a narrow complex to a broad complex tachycardia (ie, right bundle branch block), is an ominous sign of right ventricular strain and impending shock. PE should be suspected anytime there is hypotension accompanied by an elevated central venous pressure that is not otherwise explained by acute myocardial infarction, tension pneumothorax, pericardial tamponade, or a new arrhythmia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-the-nonpregnant-adult-with-suspected-acute-pulmonary-embolism/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].

However, because many conditions that increase the D-dimer also increase the risk of PE, age-adjustment should be used with caution, particularly in patients with non-low probability for PE, until further data become available. One meta-analysis of six trials reported that in patients unlikely to have PE by the Wells criteria (score &le;4 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F54767\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54767 \">table 2</a>) (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-pulmonary-embolism-wells-score\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>), compared with a negative fixed level D-dimer, a negative age-adjusted D-dimer was associated with a 5 percent increase in the proportion of patients in whom imaging can be safely withheld [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-the-nonpregnant-adult-with-suspected-acute-pulmonary-embolism/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>].

The imaging technology is widely available and, in most settings, the exam can be performed on an urgent or emergent basis. In some cases, if contraindications to CTPA are present but can be readily resolved (eg, premedication for a contrast allergy) and alternate imaging such as <span class=\"nowrap\">V/Q</span> scanning is not feasible, CTPA may be performed after a short delay (eg, 8 to 12 hours).

A multidetector (&ge;16 detector rows) CT scanner is required to achieve sufficient diagnostic performance. Primary axial and multiplanar reformations (commonly in the coronal plane) of the pulmonary arteries are routinely reviewed. For optimal image quality, the patient should be able to hold still and hold their breath for about 30 seconds. A chest CT with contrast not performed as a CTPA but for other indications may incidentally detect pulmonary emboli but is <strong>not</strong> an adequate exam for excluding suspected PE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-the-nonpregnant-adult-with-suspected-acute-pulmonary-embolism/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>].</p><p>A CTPA result may be indeterminate for a number of reasons.

Repeat CTPA for more definitive results may be worthwhile if the factor causing poor image quality can be mitigated (eg, patient more capable of cooperating with positioning and breath-holding instructions). Repeat imaging is unlikely to prove useful if CTPA is nondiagnostic from factors such as scanner technology, body habitus, or indwelling metallic foreign bodies. </p><p>CTPA may be relatively contraindicated in patients with a history of moderate to severe iodinated contrast allergy or renal insufficiency (eGFR &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>). The risk of these contraindications must be weighed against the clinical importance of performing the CTPA examination and the availability of alternative imaging approaches (eg <span class=\"nowrap\">V/Q</span> scan). If clinically feasible, CTPA should be delayed for premedication for history of allergy or intravenous hydration for renal insufficiency.

Conversely, PE can complicate acute pulmonary diseases illness (eg, emphysema, pneumonia). Thus, the presence of another diagnosis does not completely exclude the possibility of PE. Wheezing is uncommon in PE, and may suggest an exacerbation of pre-existing lung disease such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. However, hypoxemia or respiratory distress out of proportion to obstructive symptoms or wheezing should prompt consideration of PE.

The most common presenting symptom is dyspnea followed by chest pain (classically but not always pleuritic) and cough. However, many patients, including those with large PE, have mild symptoms or are asymptomatic. (See <a href=\"#H456585787\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with symptoms consistent with PE, tests including electrocardiography (ECG), chest radiography, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and troponin levels, and arterial blood gases (ABG) should be performed. However, these tests are neither sensitive nor specific for the diagnosis of PE, and are most useful for confirming the presence of alternative diagnoses or providing prognostic information in the event that PE is diagnosed. (See <a href=\"#H325664986\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory tests'</a> above and <a href=\"#H325664432\" class=\"local\">'Electrocardiography'</a> above and <a href=\"#H325666154\" class=\"local\">'Chest radiograph'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with a high clinical suspicion for PE who are hemodynamically unstable and successfully resuscitated, immediate anticoagulation and definitive diagnostic imaging is preferred. For patients with a low or moderate suspicion of PE who are successfully resuscitated, the same approach to diagnosis and empiric anticoagulation should be used as for patients who are hemodynamically stable. For patients who remain unstable despite resuscitation, bedside echocardiography and lower extremity compression ultrasonography (US) with Doppler of the leg veins can be used to obtain a rapid or presumptive diagnosis of PE (visualization of thrombus or new right heart strain) to justify the administration of potentially life-saving therapies, including thrombolytic agents. (See <a href=\"#H257406054\" class=\"local\">'Hemodynamically unstable patients'</a> above and <a href=\"#H257411441\" class=\"local\">'Echocardiography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with suspected PE who are hemodynamically stable, we suggest an approach that selectively integrates clinical evaluation, three-tiered pretest probability testing (eg, clinical gestalt or the Wells criteria (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-pulmonary-embolism-wells-score\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F54767\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54767 \">table 2</a>)), PE rule out criteria (PERC), D-dimer, and imaging. Computed tomographic pulmonary angiography (CTPA), also called chest computed tomography (CT) angiogram with contrast, is the preferred imaging exam (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F113961\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef113961 \">algorithm 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F113962\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef113962 \">algorithm 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F113963\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef113963 \">algorithm 3</a>) (see <a href=\"#H518402085\" class=\"local\">'Hemodynamically stable patients'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In patients with a <strong>low</strong> clinical probability of PE (eg, &lt;15 percent, Wells score &lt;2), the PERC (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F94941\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94941 \">table 3</a>) should be applied. Patients who fulfill all eight criteria do not need additional testing. For patients who do not fulfill PERC criteria or in whom PERC cannot be applied (eg, critically-ill patients), further testing with sensitive D-dimer measurement is indicated; no imaging is required when the D-dimer level is normal (&lt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> [fibrinogen equivalent units]), while imaging is indicated in those with a positive D-dimer (&ge;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> [fibrinogen equivalent units]). (See <a href=\"#H1051207118\" class=\"local\">'Low probability of pulmonary embolism'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In patients with an <strong>intermediate</strong> clinical probability of PE (eg, Wells score 2 to 6), we prefer sensitive D-dimer testing to determine whether or not diagnostic imaging is indicated. Patients with a negative D-dimer do not need imaging while those with a positive D-Dimer should have chest imaging. However, some experts proceed directly to diagnostic imaging in select patients (eg, those with limited cardiopulmonary reserve or those in the upper zone of the intermediate range such as a Wells score of 4 to 6). (See <a href=\"#H4193013179\" class=\"local\">'Intermediate probability of pulmonary embolism'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In patients with a <strong>high</strong> clinical probability of PE (eg, Wells score &gt;6), we prefer diagnostic imaging with CTPA. A positive result confirms the diagnosis of PE while a negative result excludes it in nearly all cases. (See <a href=\"#H1051207137\" class=\"local\">'High probability of pulmonary embolism'</a> above and <a href=\"#H518402072\" class=\"local\">'Computed tomography pulmonary angiography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CTPA acquires thin (&le;2.5 mm) section volumetric images of the chest after a bolus administration of intravenous contrast that is timed precisely for maximal enhancement of the pulmonary arteries. A multidetector row (&ge;16 detectors rows) CT scanner is required to achieve sufficient diagnostic performance. A chest CT with contrast not performed as a CTPA but for other indications is not an adequate exam to exclude suspected PE. (See <a href=\"#H1017120948\" class=\"local\">'CTPA imaging protocol'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with suspected PE in whom CTPA is contraindicated, unavailable, or inconclusive, ventilation perfusion <span class=\"nowrap\">(V/Q)</span> scanning is the alternative imaging exam. <span class=\"nowrap\">V/Q</span> scan results, reported as high-, intermediate- or low-probability for PE, or normal, should be interpreted in conjunction with clinical suspicion. A high-probability <span class=\"nowrap\">V/Q</span> scan and high clinical probability is sufficient to confirm PE. A normal scan or a low-probability scan in the setting of low clinical probability of PE can also be used to rule out PE. All other combinations of <span class=\"nowrap\">V/Q</span> results and clinical probability are nondiagnostic. (See <a href=\"#H518402085\" class=\"local\">'Hemodynamically stable patients'</a> above and <a href=\"#H71352954\" class=\"local\">'Ventilation perfusion scan'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients in whom both CTPA and <span class=\"nowrap\">V/Q</span> scanning are contraindicated, unavailable, or inconclusive, we prefer noninvasive testing with lower extremity compression ultrasonography with Doppler (although not diagnostic of PE). (See <a href=\"#H532699166\" class=\"local\">'Lower-extremity ultrasound with Doppler'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A diagnosis of PE is made radiographically based upon CTPA, magnetic resonance pulmonary angiogram (MRPA), or catheter-based pulmonary angiography by the demonstration of a filling defect in any branch of the pulmonary artery. With <span class=\"nowrap\">V/Q</span> scanning, a high-probability scan with high clinical probability confirms PE. (See <a href=\"#H746822388\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of PE includes many other entities that present similarly with dyspnea, chest pain, hypoxemia, leg pain and swelling, tachycardia, syncope, and shock. Other competing diagnoses including heart failure, myocardial ischemia, pneumothorax, pneumonia, and pericarditis may be distinguished on electrocardiographic, echocardiographic, laboratory, and chest radiographic testing. However, PE can coexist with these conditions and, therefore, the presence of an alternate diagnosis does not completely exclude the diagnosis of PE.
