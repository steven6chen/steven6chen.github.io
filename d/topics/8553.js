These glands make a hormone that helps control the amount of calcium in the blood. The hormone is called &quot;parathyroid hormone,&quot; or &quot;PTH.&quot;</p><p>You get hypoparathyroidism when you have too little PTH in your body. This causes the levels of calcium in your blood to get too low.</p><p>Neck surgery on the thyroid or parathyroid glands or major surgery for head and neck cancer is the most common cause of hypoparathyroidism. After this surgery, some people have hypoparathyroidism that lasts only a short time. Other people have hypoparathyroidism for the rest of their lives, but this is less common. Other conditions can also cause hypoparathyroidism.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9646603\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of hypoparathyroidism?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms are different depending on the cause of hypoparathyroidism.</p><p>People who develop hypoparathyroidism after neck surgery can have the following symptoms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tingling in the hands or feet, or around the mouth</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unusual muscle movements, such as jerking, twitching, or spasms</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscle cramps</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling tired, irritable, anxious, or depressed</p><p/><p>People with long-lasting hypoparathyroidism caused by other medical conditions can have:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eye problems, especially cataracts</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dry, thick skin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coarse hair that breaks easily and can fall out, causing bald spots</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fingernails that break easily, with ridges that go from left to right</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9646618\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for hypoparathyroidism?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. A doctor or nurse should be able to tell if you have hypoparathyroidism by doing blood tests to measure your calcium and PTH levels. He or she might also test the levels of other minerals and vitamin D in your blood. You might have tests to measure calcium and magnesium levels in your urine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9646632\"><span class=\"h1\">How is hypoparathyroidism treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Taking calcium and vitamin D supplements is the main treatment for hypoparathyroidism. Your doctor might also give you medicines, such as diuretics (water pills) to prevent too much calcium from leaving your body in your urine.</p><p>When you start taking supplements, your doctor or nurse will test your blood and urine every week. The tests will show if your calcium level is coming back to normal. Your doctor or nurse can also check that the supplements are not causing other health problems. When your calcium level is normal again, you only need blood and urine tests every 3 to 6 months.</p><p>If you have permanent hypoparathyroidism, you will need to take supplements for life. If your parathyroid glands stop working for a short time, such as after surgery, you might only need treatment until the glands start working again.</p><p>If you have permanent hypoparathyroidism and supplements are not enough to keep your calcium levels up, your doctor might give you another medicine, too. This is called &quot;parathyroid hormone&quot; and is given as a shot once or twice each day. It is very expensive.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9646647\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you want to get pregnant, talk to your doctor, nurse, or midwife about your hypoparathyroidism. He or she will measure your levels of calcium, PTH, and vitamin D while you are pregnant and after you give birth. Testing is especially important in the later months of pregnancy and while you are nursing your baby. Your doctor, nurse, or midwife can help you get the right supplements and any medicines you need to have a healthy baby.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9646662\"><span class=\"h1\">What will my life be like?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people with hypoparathyroidism are able to live normal lives. If your doctor or nurse gives you supplements or medicines, take them the way he or she tells you to. Make sure you get any tests you need on time. If you have questions, ask your doctor or nurse. He or she will watch for problems and treat them if they happen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9646677\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypothyroidism-underactive-thyroid-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypothyroidism-underactive-thyroid-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
