If not for an intact fibrinolytic system, even the smallest thrombus required to stem blood loss following minor vessel wall injury would progress rapidly and potentially compromise tissue-perfusing blood flow. Moreover, intravascular fibrinolysis represents a vital defense mechanism, preventing &quot;hemostasis in the wrong place&quot; that could, under pathologic conditions, occur in the coronary arterial bed or cerebral vasculature. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fibrinolytic-markers-and-cardiovascular-risk\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fibrinolytic markers and cardiovascular risk&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An understanding of fibrinolysis has paved the way for the development of fibrinolytic (thrombolytic) agents that can be used therapeutically for a variety of thrombotic disorders, including myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, and acute pulmonary embolism. Considered on a global scale, fibrinolytic agents are used most often in the early treatment of acute myocardial infarction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fibrinolysis-for-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-initiation-of-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fibrinolysis for acute ST elevation myocardial infarction: Initiation of therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The fundamental biology and physiology of the vascular endothelium and the mechanisms of thrombosis are reviewed here. This will be followed by a discussion of the mechanisms of and the factors influencing thrombolysis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">VASCULAR ENDOTHELIUM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The vascular endothelium is intricately related to normal vessel responsiveness that includes dilation and constriction as needed, and resistance to non-hemostatic blood clotting also known as thromboresistance. It is a multifunctional organ system composed of metabolically active and physiologically responsive component cells that meticulously regulate blood flow, according to metabolic conditions.</p><p>A study detailed the release of extracellular vesicles into the extracellular space following platelet activation and adhesion to a vessel wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-endothelial-function-and-fundamental-mechanisms-of-fibrinolysis-thrombolysis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The most abundant extracellular vesicles within human blood are derived from either platelets or megakaryocytes. Several platelet-specific markers have been identified and include CD9, CD63, TSG101, flotillin, and ALIX [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-endothelial-function-and-fundamental-mechanisms-of-fibrinolysis-thrombolysis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>Platelet exosomes are likely of endosomal origin and subsequently released with the fusion of multi-vesicular bodies to the plasma membrane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-endothelial-function-and-fundamental-mechanisms-of-fibrinolysis-thrombolysis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. By contrast, micro-vesicles are released with budding of the plasma membrane at specific sites referred to as micro-domains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-endothelial-function-and-fundamental-mechanisms-of-fibrinolysis-thrombolysis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Employing varied centrifugation methods, Savelyera and colleagues identified vesicles of platelet and T cell origins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-endothelial-function-and-fundamental-mechanisms-of-fibrinolysis-thrombolysis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. They also performed high throughput sequencing of RNA contained within the vesicles and identified miRNAs. There were non-vesicle-related fragments of other cellular RNAs, including rRNAs, tRNAs, Inc-RNAs, mRNAs, and RNAs encoded by mtDNAs, highlighting the diversity of RNAs within the circulation. &#160;</p><p>Platelet micro-vesicles can be internalized by neutrophils through a highly regulated mechanism that augments inflammation. Specifically, micro-vesicles and their RNA, miRNA, and other cargo are internalized by activated neutrophils within the endomembrane system through 12-hydroxyeicosatetranoic acid (12(s)-HETE) and platelet-type12-lipoxygenase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-endothelial-function-and-fundamental-mechanisms-of-fibrinolysis-thrombolysis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Anatomic considerations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vascular endothelial cells form a single layer of simple squamous lining cells. The cells themselves are polygonal in shape, varying between 10 and 50 micrometers in diameter, and elongated in the long axis, orienting the cellular longitudinal dimension in the direction of blood flow. The endothelial cell has three surfaces:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonthrombogenic (luminal)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adhesive (subluminal)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cohesive</p><p/><p>The luminal surface is smooth and devoid of electron-dense connective tissue. The luminal membrane or glycocalyx adds significantly to the vessel's thromboresistant properties, carrying a negative charge that repels similarly charged circulating blood cells.</p><p>The subluminal (abluminal) surface adheres to connective tissue within the subendothelial zone. Small processes penetrate through a series of internal layers to form myoendothelial junctions with subjacent smooth muscle cells.</p><p>The cohesive surface of the vascular endothelium joins adjacent cells to one another by cell junctions of two basic types: occluding (tight) and communicating (gap).</p><p>There is also a cell-matrix interface (adherens junctions), which is modulated, at least in part, by endothelial cell-cell tugging forces. The up-regulation and down-regulation of tugging force correlates with myosin activation and inhibition, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-endothelial-function-and-fundamental-mechanisms-of-fibrinolysis-thrombolysis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Thromboresistant properties</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As an active site of protein synthesis, endothelial cells synthesize, secrete, modify, and regulate connective tissue components, vasodilators, vasoconstrictors, anticoagulants, procoagulants, fibrinolytic proteins, and prostanoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-endothelial-function-and-fundamental-mechanisms-of-fibrinolysis-thrombolysis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. One of the most important functions of the vascular endothelium is to prevent the initiation and development of nonphysiologic thrombi (ie, thrombosis not required for hemostatic regulation and vascular repair). This effect is governed and regulated by a variety of factors:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Prostacyclin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prostacyclin (PGI2) is a potent vasodilator that is released locally in response to biochemical and mechanical mediators. It also inhibits platelet aggregation by increasing intracellular cyclic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adenosine</a> monophosphate (cAMP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-endothelial-function-and-fundamental-mechanisms-of-fibrinolysis-thrombolysis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The vasodilatory and platelet inhibiting properties of prostacyclin directly oppose the effects of thromboxane and are mediated by interactions at their respective receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-endothelial-function-and-fundamental-mechanisms-of-fibrinolysis-thrombolysis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Nitric oxide</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nitric oxide is an L-arginine derivative that relaxes smooth muscles by increasing intracellular cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-endothelial-function-and-fundamental-mechanisms-of-fibrinolysis-thrombolysis/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. It is released locally in response to a number of biochemical mediators, including thrombin, bradykinin, thromboxane A2, histamine, adenine nucleotides, shear stress, and aggregating platelets. In addition to its vasoactive properties, nitric oxide is also a potent inhibitor of platelet adhesion and aggregation; the antiaggregatory effect may be synergistic with that of prostacyclin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-endothelial-function-and-fundamental-mechanisms-of-fibrinolysis-thrombolysis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Enhanced production of nitric oxide also reduces endotoxin- and cytokine-induced expression of tissue factor and the prothrombotic potential of the endothelial cell [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-endothelial-function-and-fundamental-mechanisms-of-fibrinolysis-thrombolysis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Patients with atherosclerosis uniformly develop endothelial dysfunction with reduced nitric oxide secretion in response to acetylcholine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-endothelial-function-and-fundamental-mechanisms-of-fibrinolysis-thrombolysis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Existing data suggest that acetylcholine may render nitric oxide synthase dysfunctional among patients with advanced coronary artery disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-endothelial-function-and-fundamental-mechanisms-of-fibrinolysis-thrombolysis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This may contribute to the increased platelet aggregability and thrombotic events seen in atherosclerosis. L-arginine, by increasing nitric oxide activity, inhibits platelet aggregation. Support for the clinical importance of this effect comes from a study of 42 patients undergoing carotid endarterectomy who were receiving heparin and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>; compared to placebo, treatment with L-arginine or S-nitrosoglutathione, a physiologic nitric oxide donor, reduced the extent of cerebral platelet embolization, as determined by ultrasound Doppler signals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-endothelial-function-and-fundamental-mechanisms-of-fibrinolysis-thrombolysis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Plasminogen activators</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vascular endothelial cells synthesize and release activators, which are capable of converting plasminogen to the serine protease plasmin, an enzyme that proteolytically degrades fibrin (and fibrinogen). Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and urokinase-type plasminogen activator (UK) generate plasmin locally; as a result, fibrinolysis is limited to the immediate environment. Stimuli for the release of vascular plasminogen activators include epinephrine, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoproterenol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoproterenol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methacholine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methacholine</a>, thrombin, heparin, interleukin-1, venous occlusion, aggregating platelets, and dDAVP, a nonpressor analogue of antidiuretic hormone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-endothelial-function-and-fundamental-mechanisms-of-fibrinolysis-thrombolysis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI)-1 is a globular glycoprotein with a molecular weight of 50,000 daltons; it is comprised of 379 amino acids in a single chain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-endothelial-function-and-fundamental-mechanisms-of-fibrinolysis-thrombolysis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The primary structure of PAI-1 designates it as a member of the superfamily of serine protease inhibitors (serpins); PAI-1 is structurally similar to other serpins, including angiotensinogen, antithrombin-III, and alpha-2 antiplasmin. In its latent form, PAI-1 is not susceptible to cleavage by tPA nor does it form complexes with tPA; however, in its active form, it is both susceptible to cleavage and readily forms complexes with tPA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-endothelial-function-and-fundamental-mechanisms-of-fibrinolysis-thrombolysis/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Heparin-like molecules</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endothelial cells are capable of synthesizing heparin-like molecules, proteoglycans like heparin sulfate, with anticoagulant properties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-endothelial-function-and-fundamental-mechanisms-of-fibrinolysis-thrombolysis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. As a result, vascular thromboresistance is mediated, at least in part, through the interaction of heparin-like substances with antithrombin and heparin cofactor II, both of which are located on the endothelial surface, thereby accelerating the neutralization of hemostatic (procoagulant) proteins.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Heparin cofactor II</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Heparin cofactor II, a potent inhibitor of thrombin, is secreted by the liver into circulating blood where it is present at a concentration of approximately 1.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L</span>.

Protein C is synthesized in the liver and is secreted into plasma as a two-chain disulfide bonded glycoprotein. It serves as an important anticoagulant (activated protein C) (APC) by preferentially deactivating the activated forms of factor V and factor VIII (principally by cleaving their heavy chains). Protein S supports the anticoagulant function of activated protein C by promoting its interaction with factors Va and VIIIa. Because protein S enhances activated protein C-mediated factor Va activation by only twofold, it may also exert an APC-independent anticoagulant effect.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Tissue factor pathway inhibitor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI)-1 is also located on the endothelial surface, where it acts against the combined action of tissue factor and factor VIIa in the presence of factor Xa. The proposed mechanism for inhibition of tissue factor-factor VIIa involves the formation of a quaternary complex with TFPI and factor X in a two-step reaction: factor Xa generated by tissue factor-factor VIIa binds reversibly with TFPI; this binary complex binds, in a calcium-dependent manner, to membrane bound tissue factor-factor VIIa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-endothelial-function-and-fundamental-mechanisms-of-fibrinolysis-thrombolysis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

The most common disorder associated with impaired vascular thromboresistance is atherosclerosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F63061\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63061 \">table 1</a>). Damaged or &quot;perturbed&quot; endothelial cells, however, can lose their ability to maintain thromboresistance and can actually promote thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-endothelial-function-and-fundamental-mechanisms-of-fibrinolysis-thrombolysis/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>].

Furthermore, impaired local fibrinolytic activity can prevent clot dissolution. The promotion of thrombosis by endothelial dysfunction is in part mediated by an abnormal response to thrombin generation and activity. Under normal circumstances thrombin stimulates platelet-mediated vasoconstriction (caused by thromboxane A2 release), which is prevented by the simultaneous thrombin-induced release of prostacyclin and nitric oxide from endothelial cells. In atherosclerotic vessels, however, the response to thrombin is almost entirely vasoconstrictive (and thrombotic) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-endothelial-function-and-fundamental-mechanisms-of-fibrinolysis-thrombolysis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].

The exposure of circulating blood to disrupted or dysfunctional surfaces (as with rupture, erosion, or cholesterol crystal protrusion of an atherosclerotic plaque) initiates a series of complex, yet orderly, steps that give rise to the rapid deposition of platelets, erythrocytes, and insoluble fibrin, producing a mechanical barrier to blood flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-endothelial-function-and-fundamental-mechanisms-of-fibrinolysis-thrombolysis/abstract/55-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">55-58</a>].</p><p>In most instances, thrombus occurring in the arterial system is comprised of platelets and fibrin in a tightly packed network. In contrast, venous thrombi consist of a more loosely network of erythrocytes, leukocytes, and fibrin.</p><p>The process of vascular thrombosis, particularly in the arterial system, is dynamic, with clot formation and dissolution occurring almost simultaneously. The overall extent of thrombosis and ensuing circulatory compromise is therefore determined by the relation or &quot;balance&quot; between these opposing forces. If local stimuli exceed the vessel's thromboresistant capabilities, thrombosis will occur. If, on the other hand, the stimulus toward thrombosis is not strong and intrinsic defenses are intact with the potential to upregulate, clot formation of clinical importance is unlikely.

These events lead to an assembly of enzyme complexes that increase local concentrations of procoagulant substrate; in this way, a relatively minor initiating stimulus can be greatly amplified to yield a thrombus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Fibrin formation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The final phase in thrombus formation involves the generation of a stable fibrin network that provides the structural support for the circulating blood's cellular elements and a scaffold for vascular remodeling. In this process, thrombin cleaves two small peptides, fibrinopeptide A and fibrinopeptide B, to form fibrin monomers, which in turn polymerize to form soluble fibrin strands. An orderly assembly, branching, and lateral association of fibrillar strands follows, terminating with factor XIII-mediated covalent cross-linking to form a mature fibrin network (mature thrombus).

Fundamentally, the agent must be delivered to, bathe, and ultimately infiltrate the thrombus while concomitantly being provided with an adequate amount of substrate (plasminogen) and the appropriate metabolic environment for an enzymatic reaction (conversion of plasminogen to plasmin) to take place. The intrinsic composition or ultrastructure of the thrombus itself also affects its lysability.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h3\">Hemodynamic factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Changes in the total amount and distribution of coronary blood flow determine oxygen delivery to the myocardium. They may also determine the delivery of enzymatic substrate and plasminogen activators to the occlusive coronary thrombus. Coronary blood flow correlates directly with mean arterial pressure. The flow-pressure curve is relatively flat above 65 to 70 mmHg but declines as mean arterial pressure falls below this level.</p><p>Experimental data obtained by magnetic resonance imaging and by photographing clot dissolution in vitro have shown that whole blood clots dissolve two orders of magnitude faster when thrombolytic agents are introduced into the clot by pressure-induced permeation than when access is limited solely to diffusion. When a pressure gradient exists along an occlusive clot, plasma flows through pores in the fibrin network and distributes plasminogen activators along the clot. In the absence of a pressure gradient, plasminogen activator molecules diffuse into the clot through the blood clot boundary plane. Over time, the blood clot boundary moves inward as a result of lysis that is spatially restricted to a relatively narrow zone. The velocity of lysis is therefore limited by the diffusion constraints of both the plasminogen activator and plasmin.</p><p>The importance of perfusion pressure and bulk flow delivery of fibrinolytic agents on the efficacy of thrombolysis can be illustrated by two observations: the rate of dissolution of a coronary artery thrombus is markedly depressed when systemic hypotension (and hypoperfusion) is present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-endothelial-function-and-fundamental-mechanisms-of-fibrinolysis-thrombolysis/abstract/102,103\" class=\"abstract_t\">102,103</a>]; and the rate of lysis is slow with venous thrombi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-endothelial-function-and-fundamental-mechanisms-of-fibrinolysis-thrombolysis/abstract/104,105\" class=\"abstract_t\">104,105</a>].

Initially the activated fibrin monomers polymerize spontaneously in a linear mode to form staggered chains of protofibril oligomers. The lateral assembly of linear segments allows generation of the three-dimensional network required for gelation.</p><p>For normal physiologic function, it is essential that the fibrin gel (thrombus) permit transport of both cells and macromolecules yet possess mechanical rigidity. The stiffness of the fibers and the number of contacts between fibers determine the mechanical rigidity of the gel. If many thin fibers with a high-fiber cross-link density are formed, the fibrin network pore size and therefore the mobility of a diffusing species within the gel are decreased.</p><p>A number of interrelated factors occurring in humans at a site of atheromatous plaque rupture may affect the thrombus composition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-endothelial-function-and-fundamental-mechanisms-of-fibrinolysis-thrombolysis/abstract/109\" class=\"abstract_t\">109</a>]. The weight fraction of a fibrin gel is enhanced by increased fibrinogen concentration. In this setting, the distance between fibers lessens, leading to decreased pore gel size and restricted transport of diffusing species. Increased thrombin concentration, observed commonly in the setting of myocardial infarction, also decreases fiber diameter as does thrombospondin, a large glycoprotein secreted from alpha granules of thrombin-stimulated platelets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-endothelial-function-and-fundamental-mechanisms-of-fibrinolysis-thrombolysis/abstract/110,111\" class=\"abstract_t\">110,111</a>].

At a slightly decreased pH (eg, 7.2), the Michaelis constant (concentration of substrate at which the rate of end-product formation is equal to half the maximum velocity) is higher and the catalytic rate constant is lower than at a normal pH. Furthermore, the plasminogen-streptokinase complex can dissociate entirely at a low pH. Thus, among patients with cardiogenic shock, alterations in blood pH may adversely affect the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin, impairing both intrinsic endothelial cell thromboresistance and thrombolytic efficacy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h3\">Procoagulant properties of plasmin and platelets</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The intravenous administration of a thrombolytic agent causes in a conversion of plasminogen to plasmin.

Plasmin-mediated contact activation can also activate factor VII and platelets. Thus, plasmin generation is capable of enhancing both fibrinolytic and procoagulant activity.</p><p>Platelet activation can promote thrombus formation directly and can indirectly limit thrombolysis via the release from cytoplasmic granules of plasminogen-activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) and alpha-2-antiplasmin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vascular-endothelial-function-and-fundamental-mechanisms-of-fibrinolysis-thrombolysis/abstract/115\" class=\"abstract_t\">115</a>].
