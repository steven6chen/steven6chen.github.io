Congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP; OMIM #263700, also called G&uuml;nther disease) is a rare, autosomal recessive porphyria. It results from an inherited deficiency of the heme biosynthetic enzyme uroporphyrinogen III synthase (UROS; EC 4.2.1.75, hydroxymethylbilane hydrolase [cyclizing]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-erythropoietic-porphyria/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>In patients with CEP, reduced UROS activity in developing red blood cell precursors causes accumulation of pathogenic heme intermediates (porphyrin isomers uroporphyrin I and coproporphyrin I) during hemoglobin synthesis; porphyrins are also elevated in mature red blood cells, plasma, feces, teeth, and bones. These accumulated porphyrins cause hemolytic anemia and severe cutaneous photosensitivity. In addition, the teeth, bones, and urine of affected individuals contain excess porphyrins and are often red or brown and fluoresce on exposure to light, especially with a wavelength of 400 to 420 nm.</p><p>The pathophysiology, diagnosis, and management of CEP will be reviewed here [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-erythropoietic-porphyria/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A general overview of the porphyrias and detailed discussions of the other cutaneous porphyrias are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=porphyrias-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Porphyrias: An overview&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythropoietic-protoporphyria-and-x-linked-protoporphyria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Erythropoietic protoporphyria and X-linked protoporphyria&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=porphyria-cutanea-tarda-and-hepatoerythropoietic-porphyria-pathogenesis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Porphyria cutanea tarda and hepatoerythropoietic porphyria: Pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21808019\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21808062\"><span class=\"h2\">Enzymatic defect</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the heme biosynthetic pathway, uroporphyrinogen III synthase (UROS, previously termed uroporphyrinogen III cosynthase), catalyzes the conversion of the linear tetrapyrrole hydroxymethylbilane (HMB) to the cyclic tetrapyrrole uroporphyrinogen III (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F57890\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57890 \">figure 1</a>). This occurs with inversion of one of the four pyrroles, which becomes ring D of the product uroporphyrinogen III (see step 4 in the figure) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F57890\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57890 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F68187\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68187 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-erythropoietic-porphyria/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Patients with congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP) lack normal UROS activity, and as a result the HMB intermediate accumulates excessively in bone marrow red blood cell (RBC) precursors that are actively synthesizing hemoglobin. HMB does not accumulate in the liver or other tissues that synthesize heme.</p><p>Excess HMB is converted non-enzymatically (by spontaneous ring closure without inversion of pyrrole ring D) to the non-physiologic porphyrin isomer uroporphyrinogen I (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F68187\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68187 \">figure 2</a>), some of which is then enzymatically converted to coproporphyrinogen I by uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase, as in step 5 of the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F57890\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57890 \">figure 1</a>). Coproporphyrinogen I cannot be metabolized further, because coproporphyrinogen oxidase is stereospecific for the coproporphyrinogen III isomer. The excess porphyrinogens that accumulate in CEP are oxidized nonenzymatically to the corresponding porphyrins, primarily uroporphyrin I and coproporphyrin I, which are markedly elevated in circulating erythrocytes, plasma, urine and feces. These porphyrins are also deposited in teeth and bones.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5426201\"><span class=\"h3\">Hemolysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High porphyrin levels in erythrocytes are believed to be the cause of hemolysis in CEP. To compensate for hemolysis and ineffective erythropoiesis, heme and hemoglobin synthesis are actually increased, despite the severe deficiency of UROS. Hemolysis in severe cases of CEP is often associated with anemia, because the bone marrow cannot adequately compensate for ineffective erythropoiesis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the rapid rate of destruction of circulating RBCs. Although the level of hemolysis is likely to remain constant over time, the anemia may be exacerbated by nutrient deficiencies or during other illnesses. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-hemolytic-anemia-in-the-adult#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of hemolytic anemia in the adult&quot;, section on 'Atypical presentations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5426208\"><span class=\"h3\">Photosensitivity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Isomer I porphyrins produced in developing erythrocytes are released into the circulation in plasma and mature erythrocytes. Photosensitivity occurs because these porphyrins circulate to the skin and generate free radicals upon exposure to light. Porphyrins absorb wavelengths of light especially in the 400 to 420 nm range (ie, the Soret peak for porphyrins), which is visible light close to the range of long wavelength ultraviolet light (ie, UVA; range 315 to 400 nm). Patients with CEP and other cutaneous porphyrias are sensitive to sunlight and to some extent fluorescent and even incandescent indoor lights. Window glass transmits this light (but not short wave ultraviolet light [ie, UVB]) and therefore is not protective. Porphyrins that are activated by light generate oxygen free radicals that damage cells and tissues, causing skin friability and blistering. If severe and continuous, accumulated damage to the skin can lead to scarring and mutilation. Superimposed bacterial infection contributes to mutilation. (See <a href=\"#H6754926\" class=\"local\">'Clinical findings'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21808069\"><span class=\"h2\">Gene mutations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The enzymatic defect in CEP is almost always due to mutations in the <em>UROS</em> gene or rarely in other genes that affect <em>UROS</em> gene expression. A variety of mutations in the <em>UROS</em> gene have been identified in patients with CEP. These include missense and nonsense mutations, large and small deletions and insertions, splicing defects, and intronic branch point mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-erythropoietic-porphyria/abstract/5-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-15</a>]. The majority of patients with CEP are heteroallelic (ie, compound heterozygotes) for <em>UROS</em> mutations. Most who are homoallelic for a single <em>UROS</em> mutation have consanguineous parents. The role of <em>UROS</em> mutations in CEP has been further demonstrated by mouse models in which knock-in of human <em>UROS</em> mutations produced characteristic findings of the human disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-erythropoietic-porphyria/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p>In one study, the most common mutation, C73R, was found in approximately 33 percent of the studied alleles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-erythropoietic-porphyria/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The next most common mutations were L4F and T228M (7 and 6 percent, respectively). Except for the above mutations, most other mutations have been detected in only one or a few CEP families.</p><p>Notably, approximately 12 percent of the mutant alleles were undetected by sequencing the entire UROS coding region and the intron-exon boundaries, suggesting mutations not detected by sequencing or that other sites for the mutations exist. In one case, the gene encoding the GATA1 transcription factor, which affects UROS expression, was found to be mutated, rather than the <em>UROS</em> gene itself [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-erythropoietic-porphyria/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21808076\"><span class=\"h2\">Genotype phenotype correlations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The expression level of UROS varies dramatically depending on the mutation site, from nondetectable to approximately 35 percent of the activity of the normal enzyme [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-erythropoietic-porphyria/abstract/6,19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,19-21</a>]. Homoallelism for the most common allele, C73R, was correlated with the most severe phenotype, leading to non-immune hydrops fetalis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> transfusion dependency from birth. The C73R mutation affects the stability of the UROS protein rather than its enzymatic activity, and the mutant enzyme protein is subject to premature degradation via the proteosome, suggesting that proteasome inhibitors or molecular chaperones might represent a new therapeutic approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-erythropoietic-porphyria/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p>Heteroallelism for C73R and a mutation that expresses little residual activity, such as P53L, also results in a severe or moderately severe phenotype. Patients heteroallelic for mutations that express more residual activity, such as V82F (35 percent of normal activity), A104V (7.7 percent of normal activity), and A66V (14.5 percent of normal activity) have milder forms of CEP, even if the other allele is C73R or another mutation that expresses little or no detectable activity. For example, a teenage boy whose genotype was <span class=\"nowrap\">C73R/A66V</span> had only mild cutaneous involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-erythropoietic-porphyria/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>There are notable exceptions in genotype-phenotype correlations that suggest that additional modifying factors play a role in disease severity, as illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a Palestinian family with five siblings who were all shown to be homozygous for a novel S47P mutation that markedly reduced UROS activity, four were clinically affected and one was completely asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-erythropoietic-porphyria/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a series of 29 patients with CEP, two unrelated individuals with the same CEP genotype showed markedly different clinical phenotypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-erythropoietic-porphyria/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of four Spanish patients who shared the same UROS mutations, the individual with the most severe phenotype was found to have an additional gain-of-function mutation in the erythroid-specific form of 5-aminolevulinate synthase 2 (ALAS2), the first enzyme of the heme biosynthetic pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-erythropoietic-porphyria/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Therefore, such ALAS2 mutations, in addition to causing X-linked protoporphyria (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythropoietic-protoporphyria-and-x-linked-protoporphyria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Erythropoietic protoporphyria and X-linked protoporphyria&quot;</a>) can be modifying mutations for CEP.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6754359\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP) is rare, with only approximately 200 cases reported in the literature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-erythropoietic-porphyria/abstract/26,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,28,29</a>]. The transmission is autosomal recessive. Individuals with a mutation at only one allele of the uroporphyrinogen III synthase (<em>UROS</em>) gene are asymptomatic carriers. Some, but not all, homoallelic cases of CEP are associated with consanguinity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-erythropoietic-porphyria/abstract/25,30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,30-32</a>]. With rare exception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-erythropoietic-porphyria/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], compound heterozygotes and homozygotes for known pathogenic <em>UROS</em> mutations are expected to manifest CEP.</p><p>CEP occurs with equal frequency in males and females. It shows no apparent ethnic predisposition and has been described in diverse ethnic groups including Cree Indians, African blacks, Japanese, and individuals from throughout Europe, India, and South America [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-erythropoietic-porphyria/abstract/19,28,33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,28,33,34</a>]. The age of onset (or, in some cases, correct identification) is usually at birth or in early childhood, but ranges from hydrops fetalis in utero to milder late-onset forms in up to the seventh decade of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-erythropoietic-porphyria/abstract/26,35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,35,36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6754926\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FINDINGS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H522314\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cutaneous phototoxicity and hemolytic anemia are the predominant findings in congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP). Neurovisceral symptoms (ie, abdominal pain, psychiatric manifestations, seizures, neurologic symptoms) are <strong>not</strong> components of CEP. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=porphyrias-an-overview#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Porphyrias: An overview&quot;, section on 'Acute porphyrias'</a>.)</p><p>A description of clinical findings in this very rare disease is necessarily based on the review of numerous case reports, often lacking important details, as well as a few case series. In these reports, the severity of this disease is highly variable and is explained in part by the severity of the uroporphyrinogen III synthase (<em>UROS</em>) mutations found in each case. The major factors that affect disease severity are the level of residual activity of the UROS enzyme [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-erythropoietic-porphyria/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>] and the consequent levels of excess type 1 porphyrins. Additional factors may include the degree of hemolytic anemia and consequent stimulation of erythropoiesis, and the degree of light exposure and resulting photodamage at any given level of increased porphyrins. Some cases of adult onset CEP are mild and more likely to manifest as skin-only disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-erythropoietic-porphyria/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In a retrospective study of 29 patients, the most common clinical findings and their approximate frequencies were as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-erythropoietic-porphyria/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Photosensitivity &ndash; 100 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Red urine &ndash; 93 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anemia &ndash; 66 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Photomutilation &ndash; 45 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypertrichosis &ndash; 28 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatosplenomegaly &ndash; 21 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thrombocytopenia &ndash; 21 percent</p><p/><p>The age of onset of symptoms in this series was highly variable, ranging from birth (in 38 percent of patients) to 40 years. Most patients, and especially those with more severe disease, presented by early childhood.</p><p>The porphyrins that circulate and are excreted in urine and deposited in teeth and bone in patients with CEP will fluoresce when exposed to ultraviolet (UV) light. Thus, urine and teeth will fluoresce when illuminated with a Woods lamp [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-erythropoietic-porphyria/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=office-based-dermatologic-diagnostic-procedures#H4044225\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Office-based dermatologic diagnostic procedures&quot;, section on 'Wood's lamp examination (black light)'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H347667205\"><span class=\"h2\">Cutaneous</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most cases, severe cutaneous photosensitivity begins in early infancy and is manifested by increased friability and blistering of the epidermis on the hands, face, and other sun-exposed areas. The blistering skin manifestations of CEP are similar to those in porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), as well as variegate porphyria (VP), hereditary coproporphyria (HCP), and hepatoerythropoietic porphyria (HEP), but are in most cases much more severe, reflecting the more marked elevation of circulating porphyrins found in severe cases of CEP. Skin friability makes the skin prone to blistering after minor trauma. These manifestations occur only on sun-exposed areas, most commonly the hands, face, ears, neck, and forearms.</p><p>Bullae and vesicles contain serous fluid and are prone to rupture and infection. These areas may crust over and progress to scarring and thickening, with areas of hypo- and hyperpigmentation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F89042\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef89042 \">picture 1</a>). Photomutilation and deformities, often the result in part of bacterial infection, are common in severe cases, with loss of fingers, eyelids, nose, and ears (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F89042\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef89042 \">picture 1</a>). Protection from sunlight and antibiotic treatment when needed are essential to prevent these advanced and largely irreversible consequences. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Skin and eye care'</a> below.)</p><p>Other cutaneous findings include hypertrichosis of the face and extremities, and erythematous papules on the face [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-erythropoietic-porphyria/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The incidence of cutaneous malignancies does not appear to be increased, although one case of squamous cell carcinoma was reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-erythropoietic-porphyria/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H17675486\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Although skin biopsy cannot be used to make the diagnosis of CEP, it may be done during the evaluation of other photosensitive or bullous skin diseases. The skin histologic findings in CEP are characteristic but not specific, and therefore not very helpful for diagnosis. Biopsy of skin lesions can show subepidermal blisters, atrophy, fibrosis, dermal and perivascular hyaline deposits, and hyalinization of connective tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-erythropoietic-porphyria/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

Severe hemolytic anemia in utero can cause hydrops fetalis and fetal ascites. Hemolytic anemia in neonates may cause neonatal jaundice. Patients with severe disease may be transfusion dependent; in one study of 29 patients with CEP, six were transfusion dependent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-erythropoietic-porphyria/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Anemia may be absent in mild cases of CEP, reflecting either the absence of hemolysis or an adequate compensatory bone marrow response.</p><p>Typical findings on the peripheral blood smear in severe cases with anemia include anisocytosis, poikilocytosis, polychromasia, and basophilic stippling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-erythropoietic-porphyria/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Nucleated red blood cells may also be seen. Consistent with hemolytic anemia, the reticulocyte count is increased; unconjugated bilirubin may be elevated; haptoglobin may be low or undetectable; and urine and fecal urobilinogen are increased.</p><p>Hemolytic anemia is very often accompanied by secondary splenomegaly, which can in turn worsen the anemia, and cause leukopenia and thrombocytopenia (ie, hypersplenism).

One heterozygous carrier for CEP developed a mild form of the disease in the absence of a bone marrow disorder, probably due to acquired mosaicism affecting the <em>UROS</em> gene and expansion of the porphyric allele or loss of function of the normal allele, but the tissue location of the presumed cellular clone (bone marrow versus liver) could not be identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-erythropoietic-porphyria/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].

In a series of 29 patients, the time from first symptoms to diagnosis ranged from eight days to 48 years (mean 8.1 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-erythropoietic-porphyria/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. CEP should be suspected in the setting of severe photosensitivity, often accompanied by hemolytic anemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F89035\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef89035 \">algorithm 1</a>). Adults and even children with milder disease can present with skin only disease, characterized by cutaneous blistering in areas of sunlight exposure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-cutaneous-blisters#H32804646\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with cutaneous blisters&quot;, section on 'Photodistributed'</a> and <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Tissue biopsy (eg, skin, bone marrow) is not required to make a diagnosis of CEP, and there are no specific diagnostic findings with these procedures.</p><p>As with other porphyrias, the preferred approach to diagnostic testing is to use a single first line test for screening, and more extensive second line testing if the screening test is positive (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F89036\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89036 \">table 1</a>). For porphyrias causing blistering skin lesions, the preferred screening test is measurement of total plasma porphyrins. Measurement of urine porphyrins is also suitable, with the caveat that urine porphyrins are more often nonspecifically elevated in many medical conditions. Porphyrins are chronically elevated in CEP, so timing of the test is not important, and a 24-hour urine sample is not required. Samples should be protected from light during processing and transit because porphyrins are light-sensitive; though the marked elevations in CEP are very unlikely to be normalized by light exposure.</p><p>Plasma porphyrins are often 50-fold increased over the upper limit of normal of approximately 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span>. In mild cases, plasma and urine levels may be 10-fold less than in severe cases, and in the range for patients with porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT).</p><p>If plasma (or urine) porphyrins are elevated, comprehensive second line testing is needed to establish the type of porphyria, or to determine whether porphyrin elevation (especially in urine) is due to a non-porphyria condition, such as liver disease.</p><p>This second line biochemical testing should include the following (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F89036\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89036 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urine <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> plasma porphyrins should be measured and fractionated to determine amounts of the individual porphyrins. In CEP, there is typically a predominance of uroporphyrin I and coproporphyrin I, although other porphyrins such as hepta-, hexa- and pentacarboxylate porphyrins are also elevated. Urinary delta-aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and porphobilinogen (PBG) are <strong>not</strong> increased in CEP.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A marked elevation in total erythrocyte porphyrins is always found in CEP, and is important to confirm. Fractionation of erythrocyte porphyrins usually shows a predominance of uroporphyrin I and coproporphyrin I. However, especially in milder cases, the marked increase in erythrocyte porphyrins may be mostly due to zinc protoporphyrin, as is found in all other autosomal recessive porphyrias, with the exception of the protoporphyrias (erythropoietic protoporphyria [EPP] and X-linked protoporphyria [XLP]), in which the excess protoporphyrin is predominantly metal-free.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fecal porphyrin excretion is markedly increased in patients with CEP, typically with a predominance of coproporphyrin I. There is less increase in uroporphyrin I because it is excreted in urine, whereas coproporphyrin is excreted both by the kidney and liver.</p><p/><p>If second line biochemical testing confirms a diagnosis of CEP, DNA studies are important to identify the underlying familial mutations. In a new family, the UROS gene can be sequenced, and in a family with known mutations, presence of the specific mutations can be assayed. DNA studies are available in the US at the Department of Genetics &amp; Genomic Sciences, Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY 10029 (phone: 212-659-6779, fax: 212-659-6780; toll-free: 866-322-7968), and at a number of specialized laboratories in Europe (see <a href=\"http://www.porphyria-europe.com/&amp;token=DXiNnVb2ZFrySDKpmM7piK0vep3FDAp2O059vsC/rJYMZc11DOZNo4Fc7u3H5RAB&amp;TOPIC_ID=7102\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.porphyria-europe.com</a>). This provides additional confirmation and enables genetic counseling and screening of family members.</p><p>Testing for CEP can be initiated before birth by measuring total porphyrins in amniotic fluid or fetal blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-erythropoietic-porphyria/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].

An elevation of fecal porphyrins with a predominance of coproporphyrin I is also distinctive. The diagnosis should be confirmed by detection of familial UROS gene mutations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP) primarily includes the other bullous cutaneous porphyrias: hepatoerythropoietic porphyria (HEP), porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), variegate porphyria (VP), and hereditary coproporphyria (HCP). All can be readily differentiated from CEP by second line biochemical testing, and ultimately DNA studies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F89035\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef89035 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H21259538\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic criteria'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hepatoerythropoietic porphyria (HEP) and porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT)</strong> &ndash; HEP and PCT, which are due to deficient activity of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD), are cutaneous porphyrias with similar skin findings as CEP.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">HEP is the homozygous form of familial PCT, most often with onset in early childhood, and can closely resemble CEP clinically with cutaneous manifestations of similar severity. In severe cases of HEP, porphyrin levels may be as high as in CEP. However, a predominance of uroporphyrin and hepta-, hexa-, and pentacarboxylate porphyrin in urine and plasma, as well as zinc protoporphyrin in erythrocytes are biochemical features of HEP that distinguish it from CEP. HEP should then be confirmed by DNA studies to identify UROD mutations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Mild and adult-onset cases of CEP are often initially misdiagnosed as PCT, a much more common condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-erythropoietic-porphyria/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. PCT is usually due to an acquired hepatic deficiency of UROD, with porphyrin patterns as in HEP, except that erythrocyte porphyrins are not significantly elevated. Some patients with PCT (approximately 20 percent) are heterozygous for UROD mutations, which is a predisposing factor. Plasma porphyrin levels in PCT associated with end stage renal disease can be much higher than in PCT with normal renal function, and can be associated with more severe blistering, infection, and even mutilation. PCT is readily distinguished from CEP biochemically by the erythrocyte porphyrin level; erythrocyte porphyrins are markedly elevated in CEP and typically normal or modestly elevated in PCT.

Unlike CEP, VP is also one of the acute porphyrias and can cause acute neurovisceral manifestations. VP is autosomal dominant with incomplete penetrance, and results from deficiency of the enzyme protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPOX). Characteristic biochemical findings include elevations in urinary ALA, PBG, and coproporphyrin III; fecal coproporphyrin III and protoporphyrin; and plasma porphyrins with a characteristic fluorescence peak at a wavelength (approximately 626 nm) that distinguishes it from all other porphyrias. Erythrocyte porphyrins are normal or modestly elevated in VP.

HCP has autosomal dominant transmission with variable penetrance; it results from deficiency of the enzyme coproporphyrinogen oxidase (CPOX). Biochemical findings include increased urinary ALA, PBG, and coproporphyrin III, and fecal coproporphyrin III. Plasma porphyrins are normal in most cases, but are expected to be elevated when skin lesions are present. Erythrocyte porphyrins are normal or modestly elevated.

Patients with EPP experience skin tingling, burning, and significant pain often within minutes after sun exposure. Symptoms may persist for hours or days, depending on the length of exposure, but are seldom followed by significant blistering, scarring, or deformity. EPP is autosomal recessive, due to a deficiency of ferrochelatase. X-linked protoporphyria (XLP) has the same phenotype but is due to gain of function mutations of the gene encoding the erythroid form of delta-aminolevulinic acid synthase (ALA2). In EPP and most cases of XLP, erythrocyte porphyrins are predominantly metal-free protoporphyrin. Urine porphyrins are not increased in EPP and XLP, since protoporphyrin is excreted only by the liver. EPP and XLP cases should be confirmed by DNA studies as well.

This may indicate liver disease or lead poisoning, and may also occur due to alcohol use, ingestion of other drugs, or toxins.

(See <a href=\"#H21808076\" class=\"local\">'Genotype phenotype correlations'</a> above.)</p><p>In a series of 29 patients in the United Kingdom and Europe, the two most important prognostic factors were age at diagnosis and hematologic manifestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-erythropoietic-porphyria/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Early onset disease and severe anemia characterize the most severe cases, and these two features tended to cosegregate (ie, patients diagnosed at an earlier age were more likely to have severe hemolytic anemia). Early onset cases with anemia also have the most severe skin findings, reflecting markedly elevated porphyrin levels. Patients diagnosed before age five had the most severe anemia and the worst prognosis overall. Treatment of the anemia (eg, with hypertransfusion, splenectomy, hematopoietic cell transplant) may be beneficial but also contributes to a poor prognosis. No patient developed a hematologic malignancy. Data from this series are consistent with case reports of patients with adult onset disease that describe mild symptoms and skin only disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-erythropoietic-porphyria/abstract/2,26,36,55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,26,36,55,56</a>].</p><p>Patients with CEP experience improvements in skin symptoms during the winter months, when sun exposure is reduced.

Only one patient is reported to have developed a skin malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-erythropoietic-porphyria/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Protection from sunlight reduced the severity of cutaneous mutilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-erythropoietic-porphyria/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], but skin damage from sun exposure, which may be complicated by infection and progressive scarring and mutilation, is often irreversible even when sun exposure is avoided later.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17675961\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mainstay of treatment, especially in severe cases with the highest levels of circulating porphyrins, is avoidance of sunlight exposure to the skin and eyes. Skin infections should be prevented, but treated promptly if and when they occur. Anemia may require red blood cell transfusions; however, this may lead to iron overload and need for iron chelation. Management of individuals with congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP) is best achieved by a multidisciplinary team of clinicians (eg, hematologist, dermatologist, ophthalmologist, dentist, and possibly plastic surgeon).</p><p>Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation is currently the most effective treatment and should be strongly considered in children with the most severe manifestations. Although circulating porphyrin levels may not be completely normalized, they are greatly reduced, anemia is corrected, and severe skin damage and mutilation are prevented.</p><p>Patients with confirmed CEP do not need to avoid medications and steroid hormones that provoke neurovisceral attacks in patients with the acute hepatic porphyrias, since these agents affect the liver and not the bone marrow. Porphyrin levels in CEP are likely to be increased by agents, such as erythropoietin, that stimulate erythropoiesis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin and eye care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Protection of the skin and eyes from sunlight and minor trauma is <strong>essential</strong> in patients with CEP. These patients may not experience the acute cutaneous pain after sunlight exposure that characterizes erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP) and X-linked protoporphyria (XLP), and therefore they are less likely to spontaneously avoid sunlight. Therapeutic dosages of pharmaceutical grade beta carotene (Lumitene) are seldom beneficial, and should not be used in a manner that would encourage more sunlight exposure.</p><p>Individuals with severe photodamage of the hands and face do not experience photodamage on their light-protected areas, such as the trunk, legs, and feet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-erythropoietic-porphyria/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>], which supports the effectiveness of avoiding sunlight. However, this requires major restrictions in lifestyle and is especially difficult for children. Specialized clothing for skin protection for individuals with CEP and other photosensitizing conditions can be purchased and worn when outdoors. Standard window glass, including automobile window glass, does not filter out damaging wavelengths of light, so protective garments including gloves should be worn while driving or riding in automobiles. Avoidance of fluorescent indoor lighting and operating <span class=\"nowrap\">room/surgical</span> theater lights and even incandescent lighting as much as possible is also suggested.</p><p>Affected skin should be protected as much as possible from infection. Any bacterial infection of the skin should be recognized promptly and treated with an antibiotic to avoid scarring and mutilation. Loss of digits may result in part from skin infection that was incompletely treated, leading to osteomyelitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cellulitis-and-skin-abscess-in-adults-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cellulitis and skin abscess in adults: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Bacterial infections that complicate cutaneous blisters, such as cellulitis, bacteremia, and osteomyelitis, may require intravenous antibiotics. Surgical intervention may be necessary in some cases. In a series of 29 patients, seven required surgical intervention (eg, skin grafting) for severe skin damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-erythropoietic-porphyria/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].

An intriguing report described a patient with CEP who experienced spontaneous improvement in photosensitivity and hemolysis after developing iron deficiency from gastrointestinal bleeding, and spontaneous worsening of CEP symptoms when the bleeding stopped [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-erythropoietic-porphyria/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. Subsequent treatment with an iron chelating agent improved symptoms and reduced total urine porphyrins from over 100,000 to less than 6000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/24</span> hours. Iron upregulates ALAS2, the initial enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway during hemoglobin synthesis, and therefore iron deficiency might decrease porphyrin overproduction in CEP. However, iron deficiency might also have adverse effects, and the role of iron status in CEP needs further study before this approach can be recommended.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17897818\"><span class=\"h2\">Hematopoietic cell transplant and gene therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) has been used as curative treatment in patients with CEP who have severe disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-erythropoietic-porphyria/abstract/57,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,73</a>]. Risks of chemotherapy toxicity, immunosuppression, and graft-versus-host disease may be outweighed in patients with significant morbidity or expected morbidity from CEP, especially if a suitable donor is available. This approach has only been used in children with CEP; the oldest recipient was a 15-year-old who died of post-transplant sepsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-erythropoietic-porphyria/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].

As an example, six of 29 patients in one series were treated with HCT from a related donor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-erythropoietic-porphyria/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. The mean age at transplant was five to six years, and the main indications were transfusion-dependent anemia in early childhood and genotype(s) associated with severe phenotypes and high risk for photomutilation. Five patients remained essentially cured of their CEP for a mean duration of six years; the sixth (the oldest, at 12 years) experienced progressive CEP symptoms. All experienced transplant complications. HCT from an unrelated donor is also an option for patients with severe CEP. Two children who received matched unrelated donor HCT were alive and disease-free two and three years following transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-erythropoietic-porphyria/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].</p><p>CEP could potentially be treated by gene therapy. Overexpression of the UROS gene has been achieved in cultured hematopoietic cells and induced pluripotent stem cells; use of this approach in patients with CEP remains hypothetical [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-erythropoietic-porphyria/abstract/76,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">76,77</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17897575\"><span class=\"h2\">Prenatal counseling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CEP is an autosomal recessive disorder. Siblings of an affected individual have a 50 percent chance of being a CEP carrier (ie, heterozygous for a UROS mutation) and a 25 percent chance of inheriting a mutant UROS gene from both parents and hence being affected by the disease. Families should be counseled regarding these risks and available options to reduce them, as well as the importance of prenatal diagnosis for managing affected infants. (See <a href=\"#H21483876\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p>Individuals with CEP can have children.

The father was not a CEP mutation carrier. The infant had brown staining of the teeth due to prenatal exposure to maternal porphyrins, and subsequently had normal development without evidence of disease.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H21808069\" class=\"local\">'Gene mutations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduced UROS activity causes erythrocytic cells during hemoglobin synthesis to accumulate high levels of non-physiologic porphyrins that are released into the circulation and deposited in bones and teeth. These porphyrins also circulate to the skin where they are activated by light, generating reactive oxygen species that cause severe photodamage. Ineffective erythropoiesis and intravascular hemolysis due to excess porphyrins in circulating erythrocytes causes anemia especially in patients with severe genotypes. (See <a href=\"#H21808062\" class=\"local\">'Enzymatic defect'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CEP most commonly presents in the first few years of life, but can be diagnosed at any age; there is no sex or ethnic predisposition. (See <a href=\"#H6754359\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CEP should be suspected in individuals with bullous skin disease in sun-exposed areas; this can include blistering, infection, scarring, and mutilation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F89035\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef89035 \">algorithm 1</a>). Hemolytic anemia, <span class=\"nowrap\">red/brown</span> urine, and <span class=\"nowrap\">red/brown</span> staining of the teeth may also occur. The severity ranges from hydrops fetalis or severe anemia and photosensitivity soon after birth to skin-only manifestations that develop in adulthood. Acute neurovisceral attacks are <strong>not</strong> a feature of CEP. (See <a href=\"#H6754926\" class=\"local\">'Clinical findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The evaluation of CEP includes first-line testing for elevation of porphyrins in plasma or urine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F89036\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89036 \">table 1</a>). A positive finding should be followed by comprehensive porphyrin analysis, especially including red blood cell (RBC) porphyrins. The diagnosis is confirmed by demonstration of elevated uroporphyrin I and coproporphyrin I in plasma (or serum), urine, and RBCs, and coproporphyrin I in stool, followed by DNA studies to identify familial mutations. Diagnosis can be made in utero. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CEP can be distinguished from other bullous cutaneous porphyrias by the pattern of excess porphyrins in urine, plasma, erythrocytes, and stool. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=porphyrias-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Porphyrias: An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prognosis for patients with CEP is variable. Severe disease with onset during <span class=\"nowrap\">infancy/childhood</span> confers the worst prognosis. More severe mutations cause more severe disease and a worse prognosis. (See <a href=\"#H17675486\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management of CEP requires a multidisciplinary approach (see <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Protection of skin and eyes from light exposure, meticulous skin care, and prompt treatment of bacterial infections are <strong>essential</strong> for preventing permanent and severe skin damage and loss of digits and facial features.
