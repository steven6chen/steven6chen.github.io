Pneumonic plague can be primary (eg, acquired by inhalation of respiratory secretions or aerosolized droplets from infected animals or humans or by laboratory exposure) or secondary (eg, developing in the setting of bubonic or septicemic plague). The disease occurs in the southwestern United States, the former Soviet Union, and foci in Africa, Asia, and South America.

The physical examination should include evaluation for skin lesions, lymphadenopathy, retinal or conjunctival changes, enlargement of liver or spleen, genital lesions, and neurologic findings. The approach to the initial laboratory evaluation is summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F70923\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70923 \">table 7</a>).
