The exercise ECG indirectly detects myocardial ischemia, which is the physiologic consequence of a mismatch between myocardial oxygen delivery (coronary blood flow) and myocardial oxygen demand (myocardial work). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=angina-pectoris-chest-pain-caused-by-myocardial-ischemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Angina pectoris: Chest pain caused by myocardial ischemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A well-recognized sequence of events is precipitated by an imbalance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F79335\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79335 \">figure 1</a>). This sequence helps explain why measures of ischemia obtained with echocardiographic or radionuclide imaging are more sensitive indicators than ECG measures; they occur at a lower intensity of ischemia, and thereby precede ECG changes. Similarly, silent ischemia that is identified electrocardiographically often occurs at a lower ischemic threshold than that needed for the symptomatic expression of ischemia.</p><p>This topic provides a brief overview of exercise ECG testing including methodology, indications, and contraindications, and discusses the ECG manifestations of exercise-induced ischemia. A discussion on how to select the optimal cardiac stress test in a given patient is presented elsewhere.

Serious complications (ie, acute myocardial infarction, sudden cardiac death) occur approximately once for every 10,000 tests performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-ecg-testing-performing-the-test-and-interpreting-the-ecg-results/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Thus, an assessment of the benefits and risks of testing must be made in each patient prior to the procedure. (See <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Life-threatening complications'</a> below.)</p><p>Professional society guidelines have identified a collection of agreed upon absolute and relative cardiovascular contraindications to exercise testing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F80110\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80110 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-ecg-testing-performing-the-test-and-interpreting-the-ecg-results/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].

Relative contraindications should be weighed versus the potential benefits in each individual patient prior to making the decision to proceed with exercise ECG testing. Exercise testing is generally safe in patients with mild to moderate hypokalemia or hyperkalemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-ecg-testing-performing-the-test-and-interpreting-the-ecg-results/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>There have been concerns about the safety of exercise testing in patients with a recent percutaneous coronary intervention. There were no acute coronary events in a report of 261 patients who underwent exercise testing soon after PCI with stent placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-ecg-testing-performing-the-test-and-interpreting-the-ecg-results/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, exercise testing is rarely necessary before 30 days after a stent procedure; when performed it is usually done to evaluate the hemodynamic severity of residual coronary heart disease. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H674436\"><span class=\"h1\">LIMITATIONS TO EXERCISE ECG TESTING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two broad groups of patients in whom exercise ECG testing is not the most appropriate diagnostic test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-ecg-testing-performing-the-test-and-interpreting-the-ecg-results/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who are unable to exercise sufficiently due to leg claudication, arthritis, deconditioning, pulmonary disease, or other conditions &ndash; An exercise ECG test that fails to achieve 85 percent of the patient's predicted maximal heart rate may reduce sensitivity to detect ischemic heart disease even if the test is otherwise negative (ie, absence of symptoms of angina or normal ECG findings) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-ecg-testing-performing-the-test-and-interpreting-the-ecg-results/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. There are potential problems with solely using the patient's predicted maximal heart rate, including significant variability in the predicted maximal heart rate and concurrent use of medications that can slow the heart rate, as well as excessive early heart rate response that can lead to the erroneous conclusion of having achieved an adequate exercise test. Patients who are unable to exercise sufficiently should be considered for pharmacologic stress testing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F87155\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef87155 \">algorithm 1</a>).

However, the American College of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/American</span> Heart Association <span class=\"nowrap\">(ACC/AHA)</span> guidelines on exercise testing concluded that there were not enough data to recommend exercise ECG testing alone in patients with baseline ST depression of 1.0 to 1.9 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-ecg-testing-performing-the-test-and-interpreting-the-ecg-results/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The sensitivity and specificity of exercise ECG testing have been derived from studies correlating the ECG response to exercise with coronary angiographic data (to document the anatomic abnormality). Patient gender, age, coronary risk factors, and the characteristics of the chest pain are also important determinants of the pretest probability of coronary heart disease and therefore of the diagnostic accuracy of exercise ECG testing. These issues are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stress-testing-for-the-diagnosis-of-obstructive-coronary-heart-disease#H622870625\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stress testing for the diagnosis of obstructive coronary heart disease&quot;, section on 'Estimating pretest probability'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF EXERCISE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The two most common modalities for clinical exercise testing are the motor-driven treadmill and the stationary cycle ergometer. While treadmill exercise is more commonly performed, the choice of exercise modality varies according to local expertise and available equipment. Cycle ergometry can be used in patients for whom weight bearing is problematic, and can be performed using a stationary bicycle or arm ergometry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-ecg-testing-performing-the-test-and-interpreting-the-ecg-results/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Bicycle ergometry is generally preferred to arm ergometry, as the smaller muscle groups involved in arm ergometry generally result in a lower maximum workload.</p><p>Most clinical indications for exercise testing require an incremental protocol, which progresses from low workloads to higher workloads until either a predetermined end point is reached (target heart rate or workload) or signs or symptoms develop that preclude further exercise. The most efficient protocols for treadmill or bicycle testing are patient specific as the protocol is chosen to match the physical working capacity of the individual so that a maximal effort is reached in 6 to 12 minutes. Protocols that are either too short or too long in duration may not truly reflect the patient's functional capacity. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Comparison of types of exercise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Each type of exercise has advantages and disadvantages, and many exercise testing laboratories in hospitals and clinics have two or three options available:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treadmill exercise protocols are more flexible than bicycle protocols because both speed and inclination can be varied independently.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bicycle and arm ergometry are generally less expensive, less noisy, more portable, and require less space.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ECG data are cleaner, especially at high workload, with bicycle ergometry because of less upper body motion. Blood pressures are also more easily obtained during bicycle exercise, since the upper body is more stable.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Older, more-frail individuals, and those with gait, balance, and orthopedic abnormalities may perform better with bicycle or arm ergometry than on the treadmill. On the negative side, individuals who are not experienced cyclists may experience quadriceps muscle fatigue before achieving a maximal cardiovascular effort, and the smaller muscle groups involved in arm ergometry generally result in a considerably lower maximum workload.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Common exercise protocols</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The specific speed and grade parameters for three standard treadmill testing protocols along with estimated oxygen costs for each workload are shown in the following table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F70044\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70044 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Bruce protocol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Bruce protocol is generally preferred for office-based exercise testing largely because it has been extensively validated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-ecg-testing-performing-the-test-and-interpreting-the-ecg-results/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The protocol is divided into successive three-minute stages, each of which requires the patient to walk faster and at a steeper grade (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F70044\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70044 \">table 2</a>). The determinants of the end of the protocol are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Test endpoints'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H674890\"><span class=\"h3\">Modified Bruce protocol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The modified Bruce protocol can be used in sedentary patients in whom the standard Bruce protocol may be too strenuous or for risk stratification of patients after an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in whom vigorous exercise in the immediate post-ACS period is not advised. The modified protocol adds two low-workload stages to the beginning of the standard Bruce protocol, both of which require less effort than Stage 1. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Naughton protocol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Naughton protocol is often used in post-MI exercise testing to classify patients into high-risk and low-risk categories and to determine optimal treatment strategies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-ecg-testing-performing-the-test-and-interpreting-the-ecg-results/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. This protocol is also used for functional exercise testing with gas analysis techniques to measure oxygen uptake and VO<sub>2</sub>max. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=functional-exercise-testing-ventilatory-gas-analysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Functional exercise testing: Ventilatory gas analysis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-capacity-and-vo2-in-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exercise capacity and VO2 in heart failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H553257093\"><span class=\"h3\">Other treadmill protocols</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other treadmill exercise protocols have been developed that provide a stress test intermediate in difficulty between the Bruce and Naughton protocols; a popular protocol uses two-minute stages and increases by 2 METs per stage and may be appropriate for a broader range of patients than either the Bruce or Naughton [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-ecg-testing-performing-the-test-and-interpreting-the-ecg-results/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].<strong> </strong></p><p>In the Cornell protocol, each stage of the Bruce protocol is divided into two smaller and shorter stages. Although this was done to provide more data points for the computerized ECG analyses, the protocol is also more applicable to patients with limited exercise tolerance because of the smaller workload increments. While once popular, this protocol is now rarely used.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H674690\"><span class=\"h3\">Bicycle testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For bicycle testing, exercise should begin with the patient pedaling against minimal resistance for several minutes. The work rate should then be increased in increments of 15 to 25 watts (90 to 150 kpm [kilopond <span class=\"nowrap\">meters/min])</span> every one to two minutes depending upon the subject's heart rate response; the goal is a duration of 8 to 12 minutes. Extremely sedentary or debilitated subjects may require even smaller increments.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">EXERCISE TEST PROCEDURE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H674918\"><span class=\"h2\">Pre-test instructions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients should be instructed not to eat, drink, or smoke for at least three hours prior to the examination, as this permits the patient to achieve a higher workload. The patients should bring comfortable exercise clothing and walking shoes to the testing facility. Before testing, the patient is given an informed consent form to review and sign, which describes the benefits and risks of exercise testing. </p><p>When the test is ordered, patients should be queried about the use of several categories of medications, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beta blockers, non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a>), and certain antiarrhythmic medications (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sotalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sotalol</a>), as these drugs will reduce the maximal heart rate that is achieved.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Digoxin</a>, which may also reduce the maximal heart rate that is achieved and is associated with reduced specificity for angiographic CHD.

However, no consensus exists on withholding or continuing beta-blockers (or other medications which may reduce the ischemic response) before exercise testing. As an example, although beta blockers have been shown to markedly reduce maximal exercise heart rate, no differences in exercise test performance were found in a consecutive group of men taking versus not taking beta blockers while being evaluated for possible CHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-ecg-testing-performing-the-test-and-interpreting-the-ecg-results/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Thus, in our practice, we do not have patients hold their usual medications for exercise testing, although this decision should be individualized.

(See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p>All patient medications must be identified, and it must be determined in advance if the patient has taken any cardiac medications that would alter the hemodynamic response to exercise and therefore potentially affect the results of the exercise ECG test. (See <a href=\"#H674918\" class=\"local\">'Pre-test instructions'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stress-testing-the-effect-of-medications-and-methylxanthines\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stress testing: The effect of medications and methylxanthines&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A limited cardiac examination should be performed, with attention given to detecting heart murmurs (particularly aortic stenosis), evidence of heart failure, and pulmonary findings such as wheezing. The presence of an arrhythmia, confirmed by the physical examination or the resting ECG, should be documented since it may have an impact on exercise. Important examples are atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter which, if not appropriately treated with an AV nodal blocking agent, may result in excessively high heart rates during exercise. Uncontrolled ventricular or supraventricular tachyarrhythmia is a contraindication to exercise testing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F80110\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80110 \">table 1</a>).

Failure to achieve this goal in the absence of chest discomfort or ECG evidence of ischemia reduces the diagnostic power of the test to rule out ischemic heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-ecg-testing-performing-the-test-and-interpreting-the-ecg-results/abstract/7,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,13</a>]. However, optimally, the exercise test should be symptom limited (see below) rather than stopped for achievement of a target heart rate, as in some patients, a symptom that is being investigated may not occur until a higher heart rate is reached. </p><p>The maximal HR decreases as a function of age, and traditionally has been predicted by the following equation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-ecg-testing-performing-the-test-and-interpreting-the-ecg-results/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]:</p><p> &#160;Maximal HR = 220 &ndash; age (in years)</p><p>This formula is derived from populations, and an individual's maximum heart rate may vary by as much as 10 percent.

Data should be obtained at the end of each stage and at any time an abnormality is detected on the monitor. Similarly, during recovery from exercise, the ECG should be recorded every two minutes for 7 to 10 minutes until the heart rate slows below 100 beats per minute or the ECG waveform returns to the control baseline pattern. In addition, continuous monitoring of the ECG waveform in selected leads should be performed throughout the exercise period and during recovery to assess cardiac rate, rhythm, and ST segment responses. Ventricular arrhythmias can occur during the recovery period, and are associated with an increased risk of death during follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-ecg-testing-performing-the-test-and-interpreting-the-ecg-results/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>The interpretation of the exercise ECG focuses on the presence or absence of ischemic ECG changes along with any induced arrhythmias.

These ischemic changes can be detected reliably only in patients who do not have baseline ECG abnormalities that can interfere with interpretation.

Reviewed briefly, the QRS complex reflects the time sequence of ventricular depolarization as the activation front spreads through the myocardium (phase 0 of the action potential) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F64133\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64133 \">figure 3</a>). The ST segment coincides with the plateau or phase 2 of ventricular repolarization, and the T wave reflects the time sequence of phase 3 repolarization. Phase 4, the resting membrane potential, is responsible for the TQ segment; this segment of the ECG is usually not considered to be important, but actually has a prominent role in the ECG manifestations of ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-ecg-testing-performing-the-test-and-interpreting-the-ecg-results/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].

The ECG portion of the exercise test is generally considered abnormal (ie, &quot;positive&quot; for ischemia) when there is &ge;1 mm horizontal or downsloping ST segment depression in one or more leads that persists at 80 milliseconds after the J point.</p><p>Subendocardial ischemia during exercise produces ST segment depression <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> elevation.

Test results that absolutely distinguish those with and without disease (ie, high specificity) are often not present in many patients with disease (low sensitivity). As an example, if a &quot;positive&quot; ECG result were defined as 3 mm ST segment depression rather than the usual criterion of 1 mm, the probability would be very high that all individuals without disease will have negative tests. Although this approach maximizes the specificity of the stress test, it substantially reduces sensitivity since very few patients with coronary heart disease will be detected. Conversely, the application of less stringent criteria for detection of disease would increase sensitivity but decrease specificity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F59283\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59283 \">table 7</a>).</p><p>Leads V4, V5, and V6 are the most sensitive leads for detecting the ST depression of subendocardial ischemia; V5 alone is often the single best lead for this purpose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-ecg-testing-performing-the-test-and-interpreting-the-ecg-results/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].

In addition, ST segment depression confined to the inferior leads II and aVF is most often a false positive response, and is of little value in diagnosing coronary disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-ecg-testing-performing-the-test-and-interpreting-the-ecg-results/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, greater ST segment depression involving multiple leads usually signifies extensive myocardial ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-ecg-testing-performing-the-test-and-interpreting-the-ecg-results/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25760459\"><span class=\"h3\">Upsloping ST segment depression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Depression of the J point (end of the QRS and beginning of the ST segment) is normally seen with increasing heart rates during exercise (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F80752\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80752 \">figure 2</a>); it is probably related to atrial repolarization that extends through the QRS rather than myocardial ischemia.

This difference was demonstrated in a study of 452 patients with single vessel coronary disease undergoing exercise testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-ecg-testing-performing-the-test-and-interpreting-the-ecg-results/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

The exercise ECG indirectly detects myocardial ischemia, which is the physiologic consequence of a mismatch between the supply and demand for blood. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercise ECG testing can safely be used for diagnostic or prognostic purposes in a variety of patients. However, there are some absolute and relative contraindications to exercise testing that should be considered before proceeding with the test. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selecting-the-optimal-cardiac-stress-test#H458218799\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selecting the optimal cardiac stress test&quot;, section on 'Indications for stress testing'</a> and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are two broad groups of patients in whom exercise ECG testing is not the most appropriate diagnostic test: patients who are unable to exercise sufficiently due to leg claudication, arthritis, deconditioning, pulmonary disease, or other conditions; and patients with ECG changes at rest that can interfere with interpretation of the exercise test. (See <a href=\"#H674436\" class=\"local\">'Limitations to exercise ECG testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The procedure for performing exercise ECG testing should include appropriate pre-test preparation and instructions at the time the test is ordered as well as a brief patient interview and targeted physical examination prior to exercise. The test should be supervised by appropriate personnel, with ongoing monitoring of heart rate, blood pressure, and ECG, and frequent queries of the patient regarding his or her perceived patient exertion and the development of any symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Exercise test procedure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ST segment depression that occurs during exercise testing is one of the most identifiable ECG signs of myocardial ischemia. The ECG portion of the exercise test is generally considered abnormal (ie, &quot;positive&quot; for ischemia) when there is &ge;1 mm horizontal or downsloping ST segment depression in one or more leads that persists at 80 milliseconds after the J point. Horizontal or downsloping ST segment depression is generally more specific for ischemia than upsloping ST segment depression.
