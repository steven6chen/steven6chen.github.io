Nutrient delivery and correction of maldigestion and malabsorption are essential to achieve normal growth to support optimal pulmonary function and to prolong life.</p><p>The CF Foundation (CFF) patient registry has documented substantial improvement in life expectancy of patients with CF (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F61930\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61930 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-nutritional-issues/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. To a large degree, the longer life achieved by patients with CF can be ascribed to improved treatment of lung disease, pulmonary toilet, potent and tailored antibiotics, dornase alfa (DNase), and lung transplantation. However, greater emphasis on CF nutrition is considered important to improve longevity and quality of life. As a result, the CFF created a consensus report on practical aspects of nutrition in pediatric CF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-nutritional-issues/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], and a more theoretic report on gastrointestinal outcomes and confounders in CF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-nutritional-issues/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>The evaluation, monitoring, and treatment of nutritional problems will be addressed here. The diagnosis and management of CF-related pancreatic insufficiency, and screening for CF-related comorbidities that affect nutritional status will also be discussed briefly here and in detail in separate topic reviews:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-assessment-and-management-of-pancreatic-insufficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Assessment and management of pancreatic insufficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Overview of gastrointestinal disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CF is caused by a defect in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), a cell membrane protein that forms a chloride channel and that regulates chloride and water flux [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-nutritional-issues/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The spectrum of CF disease varies according to the genotype and with individual and environmental factors. The nutritional risks and requirements for a patient with CF also vary along this disease spectrum but do not precisely coincide with the severity of pulmonary disease.</p><p>Insufficient production of pancreatic enzymes (exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, often referred to simply as pancreatic insufficiency) causes malabsorption of fat, protein, and several micronutrients including the vitamins A, D, E, and K. Malabsorption of fat is exacerbated by bile salt abnormalities if there is concurrent intestinal or liver disease. Pancreatic function tends to decline with age. Across all age groups, about 90 percent of patients with CF have marked pancreatic insufficiency. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-assessment-and-management-of-pancreatic-insufficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Assessment and management of pancreatic insufficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although pancreatic dysfunction is the major gastrointestinal contributor to malnutrition in CF, several other factors may contribute to the problem. These include CF-related liver disease (CFLD), bile salt abnormalities, CF-related diabetes mellitus, altered gastrointestinal motility, and small bowel bacterial overgrowth. Gastroesophageal reflux, distal intestinal obstructive syndrome, and constipation can also negatively affect nutrition. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Overview of gastrointestinal disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition to malabsorption and gastrointestinal dysfunction, two other mechanisms contribute to nutritional deficiencies and growth failure in patients with CF: chronic, progressive pulmonary infection with bronchiectasis leads to increased work of breathing and higher than expected nutrient needs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-nutritional-issues/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], and chronic infection may reduce appetite and cause cytokine-induced catabolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-nutritional-issues/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PANCREATIC INSUFFICIENCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pancreatic insufficiency is a major contributor to nutritional problems in patients with CF. The diagnosis and management of pancreatic insufficiency in this population, including strategies for pancreatic enzyme replacement, is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-assessment-and-management-of-pancreatic-insufficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Assessment and management of pancreatic insufficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The nutritional problems that may be caused by pancreatic insufficiency, including growth failure, fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies, and bone disease, are addressed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSESSING AND MONITORING NUTRITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most effective way to maintain good nutritional status in CF, as in other chronic diseases, is to prevent suboptimal nutrition from occurring.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Growth</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An important indicator of adequate nutritional status is body mass index (BMI) in a healthy range. For children with CF, the BMI target range is above the 50th percentile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-nutritional-issues/abstract/1,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7,8</a>]. Children with BMIs between the 10th and 50th percentiles are generally considered at nutritional risk, and those with BMIs below the 10th percentile are in need of nutritional rehabilitation. Children with BMIs above the 85th percentile are considered overweight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-nutritional-issues/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. There are rare CF patients who are overweight and even obese [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-nutritional-issues/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. For children younger than two years of age, the same percentile criteria are applied to weight-for-height rather than BMI. For adults with CF, the target is a BMI at or above 22 for women, and 23 for men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-nutritional-issues/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>The nutritional status of individuals with CF tends to decline during childhood. Data from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation (CFF) shows that the BMI percentile typically begins to decline at about five years of age but does not cross the 50th percentile (defined as &quot;below BMI goal&quot;) until about 11 years of age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F85551\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef85551 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-nutritional-issues/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. A prospective, observational study using data from the CFF Registry showed that greater weight at age four years is associated with greater height, better pulmonary function, fewer complications of CF, and better survival through age 18 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-nutritional-issues/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p>Careful and repeated nutritional assessments allow for early detection of nutritional deterioration. The CFF recommends that children with CF be seen every three months. A thorough dietary history and measurements of height and weight should be performed at each visit. Additional measures are tracked according to a schedule for nutrition assessment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76676\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76676 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The practices for measuring growth in children with CF are the same as for healthy children. Each patient's height, weight, and BMI should be tracked against standard curves provided by the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (<a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts&amp;token=mjmpv7xMHRIW2nr+3NCnsQOVl38wneqFrPw6SaxgudlkYjEJtDtqfw+1mukyVDAR&amp;TOPIC_ID=5882\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">http://www.cdc.gov/growthcharts</a>). For children under two years of age, curves from the World Health Organization (WHO) growth standards are used, recumbent length is tracked rather than height, and <span class=\"nowrap\">weight/length</span> is used instead of BMI. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measurement-of-growth-in-children#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measurement of growth in children&quot;, section on 'CDC growth reference'</a>.)</p><p>Another important indicator of nutritional sufficiency is the achievement of full genetic potential for height; an approach that only emphasizes BMI may overlook children with stunting. The genetic potential for height can be estimated by a variety of methods, one of which is the mid-parental target height prediction (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-prediction-of-childs-target-height-based-on-midparental-height\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>). This and other methods for calculating height potential are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-children-and-adolescents-with-short-stature#H64002967\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to children and adolescents with short stature&quot;, section on 'Prediction of adult height'</a>.)</p><p>Anticipatory guidance to optimize nutrition should be provided to all individuals with CF. Those who do not meet target goals for BMI, whose linear growth is less than expected for their genetic potential, or whose growth rates begin to plateau, require additional attention. These patients should be given intensive counseling to optimize nutrition. They should also be further evaluated to identify reasons for nutritional deficits and potential contributors to malnutrition, including inadequate pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) and small bowel bacterial overgrowth (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above). In addition, assessment of psychosocial, economic, and behavioral factors that may contribute to suboptimal nutrition is essential. </p><p>As soon as a decline in growth parameters is documented, nutritional intervention should begin (see <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Nutrition support'</a> below). In addition, patients should be evaluated for comorbidities that may explain the nutritional decline, including CF-related diabetes (CFRD) and CF-related liver disease (CFLD). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation for comorbidities'</a> below.) </p><p>For patients with a G551D or similar &quot;gating&quot; mutation of the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene (approximately 5 percent of all CF patients), treatment with the CFTR modulator <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ivacaftor-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ivacaftor</a> leads to marked improvement in nutritional status and lung function. The combination drug (ivacaftor with lumacaftor) has resulted in a modest improvement in lung function but a marked improvement in nutritional status for the most common CF mutation, F508del [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-nutritional-issues/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-the-treatment-of-lung-disease#H20592751\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Overview of the treatment of lung disease&quot;, section on 'CFTR modulators'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The CFF has developed a panel of recommended laboratory tests and testing intervals as part of the evaluation of nutritional status, as outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F56711\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56711 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-nutritional-issues/abstract/2,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation for comorbidities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bone health is partly determined by nutritional factors in CF and is an important component of the nutritional assessment. Conversely, several other CF-associated comorbidities can cause or contribute to nutritional decline, including CFRD, pulmonary disease, and hepatobiliary disease. Key features to be considered in the nutritional evaluation are discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Bone disease</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epidemiology and risk factors &ndash; Bone disease, characterized by decreased mineral density, increased fracture rates, and kyphosis, is common in patients with CF, even among those with pancreatic sufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-nutritional-issues/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Sixty percent of young adults have a kyphosis angle of &gt;40 degrees, contributing to height loss (mean 5.9 cm), chest wall deformities, and reduced lung volume and function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-nutritional-issues/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Children and adolescents with CF also have higher than expected rates of fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-nutritional-issues/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In a meta-analysis of studies of adults with CF (median age 28 years), the pooled prevalence of vertebral and non-vertebral fractures was 14 percent and 20 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-nutritional-issues/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Individuals with CF have multiple risk factors for developing bone disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-nutritional-issues/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Failure to thrive</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Delayed pubertal development</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Malabsorption of calcium, magnesium, vitamin D, and vitamin K, due to fat malabsorption </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hepatobiliary disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Reduced weight-bearing activity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Chronic corticosteroid use</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Inadequate intake of nutrients</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The risk for bone disease increases with advancing age and severity of lung disease and malnutrition. As an example, the average bone density of adults with severe CF-related pulmonary disease is more than 2 standard deviations (SD) below the expected value, and vertebral compression and other pathological fractures are common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-nutritional-issues/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Screening &ndash; To monitor bone health, individuals with CF should have yearly determination of calcium, phosphorus, intact parathyroid hormone, and 25 hydroxyvitamin D levels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F56711\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56711 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-nutritional-issues/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In addition, children should have an evaluation of bone density using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) starting at eight years of age, especially if risk factors are present (eg, BMI &lt;10<sup>th</sup> percentile for age; forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV<sub>1</sub>] &lt;50 percent predicted; glucocorticoid use of &ge;5 mg daily for &ge;90 <span class=\"nowrap\">days/year;</span> delayed puberty; or a history of fractures). Even when no risk factors are present, patients should have a screening DXA scan by age 18. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">DXA scanning is now widely available. Standards have been developed for the pediatric age group, and the findings are expressed as Z-scores to reflect age-specific standards (rather than T-scores as in adults). However, interpretation remains problematic, and requires adjustment for bone size and pubertal status; the unadjusted DXA Z-score for age and gender may systematically underestimate bone density in shorter patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-nutritional-issues/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-dual-energy-x-ray-absorptiometry#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry&quot;, section on 'Children'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In our practice, we take the following additional measures depending on the results of the DXA scanning:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If the DXA scan shows bone density within a healthy range (Z-score &ge;-1), we repeat the DXA scan every two years in growing children. The interval can be increased to every five years for adults with initial results in a healthy range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-nutritional-issues/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If the DXA scan shows borderline bone mineral density (Z-score -1 to -2), additional measures are taken to diagnose and treat any endocrine contributors to the bone disease (CFRD, hypogonadism) and to minimize use of glucocorticoid medications. Additional low-impact, weight-bearing exercise is encouraged. Patients receive supplemental calcium, phosphorus, and vitamin D (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F82276\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82276 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F85553\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85553 \">table 4</a>). DXA scans are repeated annually in growing children, and every two to four years in adults.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If the DXA scan shows markedly decreased bone mineral density (Z-score &le;-2), vitamin D, phosphorus, and calcium status are reviewed and vigorously replaced, in addition to each of the measures described above. DXA scans are repeated annually until they become normal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prevention and treatment &ndash; All individuals with CF should be counseled to ensure that intake of the recommended amounts of calcium, phosphorus, vitamin K, and vitamin D is achieved to support bone health (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F82276\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82276 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F85553\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85553 \">table 4</a>). Weight bearing exercise should be encouraged and low levels of vitamin D or vitamin K should be treated aggressively. Target levels for vitamin D (as 25-hydroxyvitamin D) are 30 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (75 to 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span>. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Vitamin D'</a> below and <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Vitamin K'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Some groups have suggested that bisphosphonate treatment should be given to adult CF patients with markedly decreased bone mineral density (DXA Z-score &lt;-2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-nutritional-issues/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In a systematic review that included 203 adult subjects, oral and intravenous bisphosphonate treatment improved bone mineral density by about 5 percent at several sites over 24 months of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-nutritional-issues/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, fracture rates were not different between treated and untreated individuals. Intravenous (IV) administration of bisphosphonates was associated with severe bone pain and flu-like symptoms. Larger trials will be needed to determine if there are effects on fracture rates. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Bisphosphonates should be approached with caution in growing children with CF. This is because osteopenia in growing children with CF may be due to decreased bone formation rather than increased reabsorption. Because bisphosphonates are essentially anti-reabsorptive agents, giving them to growing children could lead to slow bone turnover. Moreover, there are increasing concerns about the use of bisphosphonates in children because these agents form bone with abnormal characteristics, have extremely long half-lives, and the long-term risks and benefits have not been fully explored [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-nutritional-issues/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. For these reasons, we do not use bisphosphonates for children or adolescents. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">CF-related diabetes mellitus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CFRD is a common cause of nutritional decline in individuals with CF, and is also associated with declines in pulmonary function; treatment with insulin attenuates or reverses these effects. The prevalence of CFRD rises markedly with age, so that CFRD affects about 15 percent of adolescents with CF and almost 50 percent of adults over age 30. Patients with CF should be screened for CFRD using periodic oral glucose tolerance testing (OGTT) starting at 10 years of age. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-related-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis-related diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.) &#160; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H316414526\"><span class=\"h3\">Pulmonary function testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is a close correlation between pulmonary function test (PFT) results and nutritional status in patients with CF (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F85552%7EPEDS%2F111218\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef85552 graphicRef111218 \">figure 3A-B</a>). It is unclear whether worsening lung function causes nutritional deterioration (by decreasing intake or by increasing requirements) or whether deteriorating nutritional status causes poor performance on PFT testing (by weakening respiratory musculature or other mechanisms) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-nutritional-issues/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. In either case, the two are so closely linked that any child with worsening PFTs should be carefully evaluated for nutritional inadequacies. Declines in both pulmonary function and nutrition also may be a symptom of developing CFRD. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'CF-related diabetes mellitus'</a> above.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H316414677\"><span class=\"h3\">Cystic fibrosis-related liver disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CFLD is a common and important complication of CF, occasionally leading to cirrhosis and portal hypertension, and very rarely to liver failure. About 20 to 40 percent of individuals with CF develop clinically detectable CFLD. Most of this CFLD does not progress to severe disease but in the subset in which it does, it may progress rapidly. Patients with CFLD often have fat malabsorption because of insufficient or abnormal bile acids in the intestinal lumen, in addition to the underlying pancreatic insufficiency. Therefore, patients with CFLD require close attention to nutrition, including ensuring a high energy intake and adequate levels of fat-soluble vitamins. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-hepatobiliary-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Hepatobiliary disease&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H316414634\"><span class=\"h3\">Small intestine bacterial overgrowth</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individuals with CF may be susceptible to small intestine bacterial overgrowth (SIBO), primarily because of decreased intestinal motility.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Overview of gastrointestinal disease&quot;, section on 'Pancreatitis'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H224106838\"><span class=\"h3\">Intestinal resection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 10 percent of patients with CF present as neonates with meconium ileus. About half of these infants require surgical intervention, and some of those require resection of dilated, perforated, or atretic bowel, with diversion ileostomy.

In the past, the caloric requirement of a CF patient was estimated to be 130 percent of recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for calories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-nutritional-issues/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. This is now considered an unwarranted simplification. A number of studies used open and closed indirect calorimetry and doubly-labeled water to determine energy expenditures. These studies consistently show that energy expenditure is directly associated with the severity of the CF genotype and inversely associated with pancreatic function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-nutritional-issues/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>]. </p><p>Each patient should have a nutritional regimen tailored to his or her needs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-nutritional-issues/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In clinical practice, measurements of growth are the first and most important indicator of sufficient energy intake. If a child's body mass index (BMI) is in the target range (&gt;50 to 85<sup>th</sup> percentile for age) and BMI and height are steadily increasing along a percentile curve, energy intake is likely sufficient (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Growth'</a> above). If the child's growth does not meet these targets, energy intake is probably suboptimal. In this case, it is reasonable to take action to empirically increase the child's energy intake (see <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Nutrition support'</a> below). In addition, the child should be evaluated for possible causes of growth failure, including insufficient pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT), gastrointestinal dysfunction, worsening pulmonary infection, or development of CF-related diabetes (CFRD). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation for comorbidities'</a> above.)</p><p>Measurement of resting energy expenditure (indirect calorimetry) is not necessary or practical for clinical management. The technique requires either endotracheal intubation or a tight-fitting hood to collect expired gases. CF patients do not tolerate either method well. A handheld apparatus for measuring resting energy expenditure is available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-nutritional-issues/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. To date, this device has not been tested in CF patients, and its use could be limited by chronic cough and by problems with contamination.

This is particularly concerning because long-term vitamin A toxicity results in bone mineral loss and liver abnormalities.

However, in some supplements, part of the vitamin A is provided in the form of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=beta-carotene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">beta-carotene</a>. Beta-carotene is a provitamin A, and because its conversion to vitamin A is physiologically regulated, it has a lower risk for toxicity than preformed vitamin A [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-nutritional-issues/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monitoring &ndash; The CFF recommends measurement of serum retinol annually in all patients with CF (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F56711\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56711 \">table 2</a>), and that serum retinol binding protein and retinyl esters also be measured in those with liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-nutritional-issues/abstract/2,31,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,31,34</a>].

If infants are fed formula, a standard infant formula may be used; formulas containing extensively hydrolyzed protein are not helpful unless the infant has a milk protein intolerance in addition to CF.

A number of studies support this approach and show nutritional benefit through counseling with the use of behavior modification strategies to support dietary change [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-nutritional-issues/abstract/50-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-54</a>]. As an example, a small randomized trial found that a behavioral intervention substantially increased caloric intake in toddlers and preschool-aged children with CF as compared with standard care, and that these effects persisted 12 months after the intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-nutritional-issues/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>]. The behavioral techniques included differential attention (parents praised children for desired eating behaviors and ignored non-eating behaviors) and contingencies (rewards to motivate children to meet energy goals). A larger multicenter trial of children aged 4 to 12 years assessed the efficacy of a similar behavioral intervention designed to promote energy intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-nutritional-issues/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>]. The group receiving the behavioral intervention achieved improved energy intake and weight gain at the end of a nine-week intervention, and a slower rate of decline in body mass index (BMI) Z-score over the subsequent two years, as compared with control patients receiving nutritional education alone.</p><p>In addition to nutritional and behavioral counseling, patients with suboptimal growth should also be assessed for the possibility of emerging pancreatic insufficiency or inadequate replacement therapy; for older children and adolescents, a decline in nutritional status may be a symptom of emerging CF-related diabetes (CFRD). In addition, other types of gastrointestinal disease such as celiac disease or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) should be considered.

A variety of supplements are available and are appropriate for use by patients with CF (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F69474\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69474 \">table 8</a>). These supplements are often less efficacious than expected because the supplements tend to displace ordinary food rather than being taken in addition to a usual diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-nutritional-issues/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>], and patients often complain of taste fatigue with oral supplements. As an example, a systematic review found that calorie-protein supplements do not confer benefits above dietary advice and monitoring in CF patients who have moderate malnutrition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-nutritional-issues/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H197495868\"><span class=\"h2\">Pharmacological options</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Growth hormone &ndash; A few clinical trials have examined the use of recombinant growth hormone in children with CF and growth failure, with 12 months follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-nutritional-issues/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>]. These have shown modest improvement in height, weight, lean tissue mass compared with no treatment, and a small improvement in forced vital capacity (FVC), but not other measures of pulmonary function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-nutritional-issues/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].

There have been concerns about the efficacy, the length of treatment, and side effects with all of these drugs. There is some evidence that megestrol acetate can cause short-term weight gain, including lean body mass, and can result in improved lung function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-nutritional-issues/abstract/65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,66</a>]. Since it is a steroid, it can have steroid-like side effects. Adrenal suppression and testicular failure have been reported. Long-term use has not been fully evaluated. Cyproheptadine generally leads to short-term improvement in appetite, and is primarily useful to overcome an acute and temporary anorexia; it has antihistamine-like side effects. The long term efficacy of cyproheptadine is less well-established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-nutritional-issues/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insulin &ndash; In patients with CFRD (with or without fasting hyperglycemia), treatment with insulin has beneficial effects on nutrition, and probably also on pulmonary function. The benefits of insulin therapy are less well-established for individuals with earlier stages of CF-related dysglycemia. The possibility of CFRD should be considered in patients with progressively worsening nutritional status.

Aspects of enteral nutrition that are specific to patients with CF are outlined here. An overview of enteral nutrition in children is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-enteral-nutrition-in-infants-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of enteral nutrition in infants and children&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Enteral nutrition is widely used for patients with CF and perceived as helpful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-nutritional-issues/abstract/68-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">68-70</a>]. This practice is supported by a number of observational studies that suggest improved nutritional status and stabilization of lung function in CF patients receiving enteral nutrition, as illustrated by the following examples [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-nutritional-issues/abstract/69,71,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">69,71,72</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A series of 14 patients with moderate to severe lung disease were compared with age- and disease-matched contemporary controls, with a mean follow-up of 1.1 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-nutritional-issues/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. The patients receiving enteral nutrition experienced a weight percentile increase, while growth percentiles declined in the comparison group. The forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) in the enteral nutrition group did not change, while the FEV<sub>1</sub> of the comparison group worsened.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A series of 53 patients with CF, ten of whom were children, showed an increase in expected weight and stabilization of lung function, but these outcomes were not compared with a control group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-nutritional-issues/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].</p><p/><p>No randomized studies of enteral nutrition have been performed in patients with CF. Therefore, the clinical benefits and potential adverse consequences, including effects on quality of life, have not been rigorously addressed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-nutritional-issues/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h3\">Route</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Enteral nutrition is usually provided to patients with CF via gastrostomy tube (G-tube) because nasogastric tubes are usually poorly tolerated due to chronic cough, nasal polyps, and the sensation of suffocating. Gastrojejunostomy and jejunostomy feeding may also be used, but these tubes are more difficult to place and maintain in position. Additionally, jejunal feeds must be given continuously rather than in boluses, making the route inconvenient for ambulatory patients.</p><p>G-tubes can be placed surgically, endoscopically, or by an interventional radiologist, with minimal risk. If general anesthesia is not advisable for a particular patient, the procedure can be performed under sedation and local anesthesia. A skin-level device (or &quot;button&quot;) can be used so that the patient can disconnect from all tubing between feeds, to optimize mobility and cosmesis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h3\">Schedule</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Schedules for tube feeding vary and should take into account the patient's activities and other therapies. Feeds can be instilled continuously, as boluses, or a combination of these two regimens.</p><p>For the school-age child, a frequently employed schedule supplies approximately 40 percent of daily requirements via a slow infusion overnight, and the remainder of the requirement is supplied through food taken by mouth during the day. If the child is unable to meet the daily energy requirements, the nighttime infusions can be lengthened or the rate of infusion increased so that a greater percentage of the requirements are delivered overnight.</p><p>For the younger patient who is at home during the day, nutritional requirements can be supplied through a combination of nighttime continuous feeds, daytime meals, and daytime bolus feeds. If the child fails to ingest the prescribed amount at any daytime meal, a bolus feed is added to compensate.</p><p>CF patients often have a complex care schedule because of their need for multiple medications and frequent pulmonary therapies. Feeding schedules should take these other elements of therapy into account.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h3\">Formula</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No one class of formula has been shown to be superior to another. Some formulas supply protein that is either elemental (free amino acids) or semi-elemental (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74962\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74962 \">table 9</a>). The protein in a semi-elemental formula may be extensively hydrolyzed (containing short peptides) or partially hydrolyzed (containing longer peptide chains). However, more extensive protein digestion does not have a clinical advantage as long as pancreatic enzyme replacement is given, and it may have the disadvantage of increasing the osmolarity of the formula. In one study, a non-elemental formula plus pancreatic enzyme replacement was as well-absorbed as a semi-elemental formula without pancreatic enzymes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cystic-fibrosis-nutritional-issues/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. </p><p>Concentrated formulas with 1.5 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">Kcal/mL</span> have the advantage of delivering more calories in a smaller volume. Since nighttime urination is a problem when using high-volume overnight feeds, a smaller volume can make the feeding schedule more tolerable. When using the more concentrated formulas, care must be exercised to avoid carbohydrate overload and possible inadequate supply of free water. Use of formulas with concentrated carbohydrates may uncover CFRD. Similarly, in established diabetics, these formulas may complicate diabetes treatment. The complications encountered because of CFRD are surmountable and should not preclude the use of enteral nutrition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h3\">Enzyme replacement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is little evidence to determine the best way to administer pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy (PERT) in conjunction with enteral nutrition. In the absence of evidence-based guidelines, we suggest the following approach:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Start by calculating the grams of long-chain triglycerides (LCT) being administered. LCT is the main determinant of the lipase requirement because medium-chain triglycerides (MCT) require relatively low concentrations of lipase to hydrolyze the fatty acids from the glycerol backbone. Therefore, MCT accounts for little of the fat malabsorption in CF. The LCT:MCT content varies among formulas, as outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74962\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74962 \">table 9</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Supply 1600 to 2000 lipase units per gram LCT (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57416\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57416 \">table 10</a>).

Annual screening for CFRD is recommended beginning at age 10 years, carried out at a time of clinical stability. An oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) should be used for screening because either fasting plasma glucose or hemoglobin A1C has low sensitivity in this patient group.
