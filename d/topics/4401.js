Complications associated with any major surgical procedure, including those related to anesthesia, comorbid medical conditions, medications, and allergic reactions, may also occur.</p><p>Potential complications known to occur during or following total hip arthroplasty will be reviewed here. The complications can be categorized as intraoperative or postoperative. The preoperative assessment, the alternatives to total hip arthroplasty, and an overview of the surgical procedure itself are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-hip-arthroplasty\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Total hip arthroplasty&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INTRAOPERATIVE COMPLICATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Fracture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of fracture during total hip arthroplasty ranges from 0.1 to 1 percent for cemented components and from 3 to 18 percent for uncemented components [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Most intraoperative fractures occur on the femoral side during stem insertion. Minor fractures may be left alone or treated with wires or cables. More extensive fractures may require more complex solutions including revision of components, bone grafting, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> supplementary hardware (eg, plates and screws). Factors that increase the risk of fracture during primary arthroplasty include female sex, osteopenia, inflammatory arthropathies, and cementless stem fixation. The use of longer-stem cementless implants during revision surgery is an additional risk factor for fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Nerve injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of nerve injury in primary total hip arthroplasty ranges from 0 to 3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Injury to the sciatic nerve is most common, but the femoral, obturator, and superior gluteal nerves may also be injured. The peroneal division of the sciatic nerve is more susceptible to injury than the tibial division.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk factors for nerve injury include previous surgery, developmental dysplasia of the hip, lengthening of the extremity, obesity, and female sex.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Cause</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cause of nerve injury is unknown in almost 50 percent of cases. Known causes include compression due to hematoma or hardware, direct trauma (eg, retractor), transection, excessive lengthening of the extremity, ischemia, thermal injury secondary to cement, and dislocation. The wound should be inspected for large hematoma, and radiographs should be inspected for evidence of excessive lengthening, dislocation, and hardware position (eg, screws). The use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pelvis and lumbosacral plexus is helpful in identifying potential sources of neural compromise, including hematoma in the gluteal space and extradural impingement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends on the cause of injury. If discovered immediately postoperatively, flexion of the hip and knee will reduce tension on the sciatic and femoral nerves.</p><p>Surgical exploration is indicated for suspected nerve palsies caused by large hematoma, excessive limb lengthening, and nerve laceration. For other unidentifiable causes, observation is appropriate. An ankle-foot orthosis should be utilized during rehabilitation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Prognosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prognosis for recovery is variable and is directly correlated with the degree of nerve injury. Mixed sensory and motor losses have the poorest prognosis. Isolated peroneal injury has a better prognosis than complete sciatic palsy. Complete recovery occurs in approximately 41 percent, and another 44 percent have only a mild deficit. Approximately 15 percent have a poor outcome characterized by weakness that limits ambulation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> persistent dysesthesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Vascular injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vascular injury, while quite rare in total hip arthroplasty, can be a devastating complication. The incidence of vascular injury ranges from 0.2 to 0.3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Major vessels that may be injured include the iliac and femoral vessels, profunda femoris artery, obturator artery, and superior gluteal artery. Intraoperative injuries are often lacerations or punctures of vessels; injuries that may be recognized postoperatively are arteriovenous fistulas, arterial thromboses, and pseudoaneurysms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Cause</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Causes of vascular injury include the use of retractors, osteotomes, or a scalpel near vascular structures; cerclage wiring; excessive dissection or traction on tissues; and acetabular screw placement. An acetabular quadrant system warns against placement of screws in the anterosuperior quadrant (threatening the external iliac artery and vein) and anteroinferior quadrant (threatening the iliac vessels and the obturator nerve) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Control of bleeding intraoperatively must be performed. In some cases, simple measures such as ligation or electrocautery may be effective. However, more severe vessel injury may require formal exposure and a vascular consult.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Cement-related hypotension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of acute hypotension associated with the use of polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) cement is less than 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. A significant drop in systolic blood pressure (20 mm Hg or more) may occur during the insertion of a cemented femoral component. Use of a long-stem femoral component is a significant risk factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Pathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of potential mechanisms have been proposed to account for this phenomenon. The main cause is believed to be embolization of fat and marrow debris. Other contributing causes may be cement monomer toxicity, anaphylatoxin release, and prostaglandin release.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Prevention and management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prevention of this condition includes pulse lavage of the femoral canal, slow introduction of the stem, a vent hole in the bone for long-stem component insertion, and minimal pressurization of cement. Patients suspected of having this condition are typically managed with use of 100 percent inhaled O<sub>2</sub>, adequate volume replacement, and use of invasive monitoring.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTOPERATIVE COMPLICATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Thromboembolic disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thromboembolic disease is the complication that presents the highest risk of perioperative mortality following total hip arthroplasty. Those who have had such surgery are in the highest risk group of postsurgical patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F58607\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58607 \">table 1</a>). Stasis due to torsion of the lower limb during surgery, as well as intimal injury, has been implicated in the etiology of thromboembolic events following hip arthroplasty, but the precise etiology remains uncertain. Due to the high risk of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) without prophylaxis, standard protocol following total hip arthroplasty typically utilizes some form of chemical prophylaxis along with early mobilization. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=low-molecular-weight-heparin-for-venous-thromboembolic-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Low molecular weight heparin for venous thromboembolic disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In patients receiving thromboprophylaxis, following total or partial hip arthroplasty and prior to hospital discharge, the rates of inpatient venous thromboembolism (VTE) were estimated in a meta-analysis. This analysis involved 21,369 patients in 27 randomized trials and observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Symptomatic postoperative VTE before hospital discharge occurred in 0.53 percent (95% CI 0.35-0.7 percent), symptomatic DVT occurred in 0.26 percent (95% CI 0.14-0.37 percent), and pulmonary embolism (PE) occurred in 0.14 percent (95% CI 0.07-0.21 percent).</p><p>Data have shown that the incidence of postoperative DVT has decreased over the last decade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, despite the use of prophylactic agents, the rate of PE has remained relatively constant. A retrospective analysis found the risk for symptomatic PE after primary total hip arthroplasty to be 0.4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The risk of postoperative fatal PE was 0.02 percent. Elevated body mass index (BMI), higher Charlson Comorbidity Index, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, atrial fibrillation, anemia, depression, and presence of postoperative DVT were shown to be independent risk factors for symptomatic PE.</p><p>While some form of prophylaxis is warranted, the challenge for the orthopedic surgeon is to balance the risk of a major thromboembolic event with the risk of bleeding due to the use of an anticoagulant agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Prevention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prevention is the key to minimizing the risk of thromboembolism following total hip arthroplasty. A plethora of medications and therapeutic modalities have been utilized for prophylaxis. Prophylactic regimens and recommendations for preventing postoperative venous thromboembolic disease are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=low-molecular-weight-heparin-for-venous-thromboembolic-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Low molecular weight heparin for venous thromboembolic disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Diagnosis and treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The approach to diagnosis and treatment of venous thromboembolic disease is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-the-nonpregnant-adult-with-suspected-acute-pulmonary-embolism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, evaluation, and diagnosis of the nonpregnant adult with suspected acute pulmonary embolism&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-lower-extremity-deep-vein-thrombosis-dvt\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of lower extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-prognosis-and-follow-up-of-acute-pulmonary-embolism-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment, prognosis, and follow-up of acute pulmonary embolism in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-the-nonpregnant-adult-with-suspected-deep-vein-thrombosis-of-the-lower-extremity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of the nonpregnant adult with suspected deep vein thrombosis of the lower extremity&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of infection in primary total hip arthroplasty varies from 0.4 percent to 1.5 percent. Prosthetic joint infection can be a devastating and costly complication following total hip arthroplasty. The pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, treatment, and prevention of prosthetic joint infections are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prosthetic-joint-infection-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prosthetic joint infection: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prosthetic-joint-infection-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prosthetic joint infection: Treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-prosthetic-joint-and-other-types-of-orthopedic-hardware-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of prosthetic joint and other types of orthopedic hardware infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Dislocation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dislocation of a prosthetic hip can be a terrifying problem for the patient and a frustrating one for the surgeon. The overall incidence of dislocation in primary total hip arthroplasty ranges from 0 to 2 percent. The majority of dislocations occur posteriorly, typically with flexion, adduction, and internal rotation of the limb (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F93734\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef93734 \">image 1</a>). Anterior dislocations are less frequent and typically occur with extension, adduction, and external rotation of the limb.</p><p>Dislocation of a total hip arthroplasty is not a subtle phenomenon. Patients will typically experience a significant &ldquo;pop&rdquo; or &ldquo;thunk&rdquo; with immediate pain. There is often shortening and rotation of the affected limb. Weightbearing is usually not possible because the ball is no longer in the socket. Following dislocation, attempts are typically made at closed reduction under sedation or anesthesia. If the dislocation cannot be reduced by closed means, then open surgical reduction or revision is required. Following reduction, strict dislocation precautions are usually recommended based on the direction of dislocation. Occasionally, a hip abduction brace is used reinforce dislocation precautions. If the patient experiences recurrent dislocations, surgical intervention is typically recommended.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Historically, the dislocation rate following a posterolateral approach was greater than that following a modified lateral approach. A posterolateral approach utilizing a posterior capsular repair can reduce the dislocation rate to less than 1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. This compares with a rate of less than 1 percent using the modified lateral approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Besides surgical approach, other factors that influence dislocation include implant design, implant orientation and alignment, and status of the soft tissues (particularly the abductors). In addition, patient factors that are associated with increased risk of dislocation include female sex, advanced age, and history of previous hip procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment is dependent on identification of the cause and direction of dislocation. Most first-time dislocations can be managed with simple closed reduction. These early (&lt;three months postoperative) dislocations can be successfully treated without recurrence in 60 to 70 percent of instances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. For repeat dislocation, addition of a brace may be considered. Unfortunately, the data supporting brace use are not encouraging, with roughly 60 percent of patients continuing to dislocate despite brace use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. For dislocation as the result of failed implants, implant malalignment, excessive soft tissue laxity, or recurrent instability, surgical treatment is often necessary. A success rate of 80 percent can be expected for reoperations in which the specific cause of the dislocation has been well-defined. The success rate drops to approximately 50 percent for reoperations in which the cause of the dislocation is nonspecific or ill-defined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The highest success rate has been with constrained acetabular components [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>] or the use of a dual mobility construct [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, late mechanical failure and loosening have been observed in this group of patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Osteolysis and wear</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Osteolysis is a process in which bone is resorbed as a biologic response to particulate debris. The incidence of osteolysis is dependent on many factors including implant design and materials, type of fixation (cemented or uncemented), and surgical technique. With traditional bearing surfaces, the incidence has varied widely, ranging from 17 to 63 percent within 10 years postoperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. However, newer bearing surfaces have demonstrated much improved results with many midterm studies (under 10 years) showing no osteolysis at all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. However, longer follow-up is needed to determine the true incidence of osteolysis with newer bearing surfaces.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h3\">Symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Periprosthetic osteolysis is typically asymptomatic unless it progresses to aseptic loosening (see <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'Aseptic loosening'</a> below). When osteolysis is accompanied by pain, it generally reflects loss of implant fixation or a pathologic fracture. Pain may also be the result of a reactive synovitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h3\">Pathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The common factor in cases of osteolysis is wear and the resultant production of particulate debris, including polyethylene, metal, ceramic, and acrylic bone cement (typically in the micron or submicron range). A higher particle load is associated with a greater osteolytic response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The process begins as wear particles from the hip implant are phagocytosed by macrophages that become activated. These activated macrophages release osteolytic factors and stimulate osteoclasts to dissolve surrounding bone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Osteolysis is accompanied by expression on macrophages of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase (ADAM) family proteins, including ADAM8 (CD156), ADAM9, and ADAM12 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>]. These molecules, which have enzymatic and integrin-like functions, may play a role in matrix degradation and stimulation of formation of multinucleated foreign-body giant cells and osteoclasts.</p><p>Fibroblasts present in tissue at the interface between the prosthesis and bone may also play a role in promoting osteolysis. These cells produce proteins that can contribute to bone resorption including the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa B ligand (RANK ligand or RANKL) is a differentiation factor for osteoclast precursors and promotes development of osteoclasts. Ordinarily RANKL is thought to be important in normal bone remodeling. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-skeletal-development-and-regulation-of-bone-formation-and-resorption#H1206113\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal skeletal development and regulation of bone formation and resorption&quot;, section on 'Remodeling'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cathepsin K, a proteolytic enzyme that is active at low pH and which can degrade type I collagen found in bone matrix.</p><p/><p>As the bone surrounding the implants is dissolved, micromotion may occur. This, in turn, may produce additional wear debris. Subsequently, loss of implant fixation, pathologic fracture, or impending pathologic fracture can occur.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h3\">Radiographic appearance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radiographically, osteolysis appears as endosteal, intracortical, or nonlinear cancellous bone destruction. Lesions can become quite large and expansile, especially on the acetabular side. Bone loss is often significant by the time osteolysis appears on plain radiographs. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography (CT) scanning with metal artifact suppression can provide better visualization of osteolytic defects than plain radiographs and are useful in determining the size of lesions. MRI may be more sensitive than CT scanning according to some studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h3\">Prevention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To decrease wear and subsequent osteolysis, much attention has been directed toward elimination of possible sources of wear and particulate debris. The most common source of such debris is polyethylene from the articulation between the femoral head and acetabular liner. Highly cross-linked polyethylene with improved resistance to wear has been developed as a possible solution. Mid-term results with highly cross-linked polyethylene are promising, but longer clinical follow-up is necessary. A randomized, double-blinded trial comparing conventional polyethylene with highly cross-linked polyethylene demonstrated significantly lower wear rates with use of the highly cross-linked product at 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>].</p><p>Other approaches to preventing osteolysis are also being explored. As an example, the use of oral bisphosphonates to inhibit osteoclast activity, and thus to prevent osteolysis secondary to wear debris, has been studied using several strategies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. A population based study of 41,995 patients undergoing initial hip or knee joint arthroplasty showed a reduced rate of subsequent revision arthroplasty in patients who had received prior oral bisphosphonate therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The study examined the 1912 patients in the population cohort who underwent initial joint arthroplasty and had used oral bisphosphonates for at least six months at some time prior to their surgery. There was a significantly lower rate of revision at five years, compared with patients who did not use bisphosphonates (0.93 percent, 95% CI 0.52-1.68 percent, versus 1.96 percent, 95% CI 1.80-2.14 percent). The results for hip and knee arthroplasty patients respectively trended in a fashion similar to the results for the pooled analysis, but the results in the two subgroups did not achieve statistical significance. Thus, confirmation in other cohorts and randomized trials with adequate follow-up will be needed to establish the role of bisphosphonates in this setting.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatments available for osteolysis are surgical. The indications for surgery are dependent on many factors, but most orthopedic surgeons agree that a symptomatic patient with a pathologic fracture, an impending pathologic fracture, or extensive osteolysis with a loose component requires surgical intervention. Optimal management of the asymptomatic patient with significant osteolysis is uncertain. Exchange of the acetabular liner with removal of granulomatous tissue has the potential to decrease wear and slow the progression of osteolysis without subsequent component loosening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21457382\"><span class=\"h2\">Sequelae from metal-on-metal wearing debris</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Metal-on-metal (MOM) wear debris has been associated with numerous complications including early implant failure due to accelerated bearing wear, adverse local tissue reactions, and metal hypersensitivity reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/39-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-45</a>]. This metal wear debris can come from any implant region where one metal surface may be in contact with another metal surface. This is most often associated with the bearing surfaces of a MOM total hip arthroplasty or hip resurfacing. However, metal wear debris may also come from the metal taper (trunnion) where a metal head ball is secured to the stem or a modular neck-body junction in a dual-taper stem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>].</p><p>The most common of the MOM wear debris complications is an adverse local tissue reaction in which the metal wear debris creates problems locally. This can lead to increased joint fluid in and around the joint (sometimes referred to as a &ldquo;pseudotumor&rdquo;), thickened synovium, or local tissue necrosis which can be extensive and devastating. There are also concerns about the potential for systemic toxicity from metal debris (cobalt-chromium alloy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. Although the use of these implants has fallen out of favor, approximately one million patients worldwide have received MOM implants, the majority of which were placed between 2003 and 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. MOM implants are still being used, but are mostly limited to hip resurfacings for which there is not an equivalent alternative. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-hip-arthroplasty#H30\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Total hip arthroplasty&quot;, section on 'Bearing surface'</a>.)</p><p>Several case reports of patients with MOM implants have suggested that elevated serum cobalt levels can lead to a variety of different systemic symptoms or complications including fatigue, weakness, peripheral neuropathy, hearing loss, visual loss, cognitive decline, cardiomyopathy, and hypothyroidism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/51-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-55</a>].

The local and systemic symptoms typically improved with revision arthroplasty.</p><p>In spite of this increased awareness of metal ion toxicity associated with metal-containing implants, there are still many unknowns. As an example, it is not known what constitutes either an acceptable or toxic level of metal ions in the bloodstream of patients with these implants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. It may be that a rising metal ion level is of greater concern than a specific threshold. Furthermore, the extent of adverse systemic effects of metal ions is not known given the lack of clinical data.

This is most often caused by wear of the prosthetic components (see <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Osteolysis and wear'</a> above). The risk of aseptic loosening leading to revision total hip arthroplasty is about 1 percent per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Other etiologies include poor initial stability of the implant, poor implant design, patient factors (eg, age, weight, activity level, underlying diagnosis), and failure of fixation. In cementless implants, poor host response and lack of biologic integration may be causes. In cemented implants, poor cement technique or cement <span class=\"nowrap\">fatigue/fracture</span> may be a cause. Overall, the incidence of aseptic loosening is highly variable. Improvements in bearing surface wear characteristics, implant design, surgical technique, and patient selection have all led to a decreasing incidence.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h3\">Symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although periprosthetic osteolysis may be asymptomatic, aseptic loosening often is associated with pain. Loosening of the femoral component typically causes deep-seated aching in the proximal and medial aspect of the thigh that is worse with weightbearing and better with rest or unloading the hip.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31\"><span class=\"h3\">Radiographic appearance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The radiographic appearance is the same as for asymptomatic osteolysis.

Various tests have been used to try to differentiate these two disorders. The most definitive is joint aspiration and culture. In some cases, bone biopsy is necessary to clarify the etiology. Intraoperative cultures at the time of revision arthroplasty may also be indicated in some cases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prosthetic-joint-infection-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prosthetic joint infection: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prosthetic-joint-infection-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prosthetic joint infection: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33\"><span class=\"h2\">Periprosthetic fracture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A periprosthetic fracture is a fracture that occurs in proximity to an implant. This is a rare postoperative complication with an incidence of less than 1 percent following primary total hip arthroplasty. Periprosthetic fractures occur most often on the femoral side at sites of osteolytic lesions or areas where stress risers exist (eg, cortical perforation).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34\"><span class=\"h3\">Classification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of classification schemes have been described, but the Vancouver classification system is often utilized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Fractures are divided into type A, B, or C. Type A fractures are trochanteric in location. Type B fractures are located about the stem or tip of stem. These are subclassified into B1 (a well-fixed stem), B2 (a loose stem), and B3 (marked osseous deficiency or destruction). Type C fractures are well distal to the tip of the stem.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H35\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment options for periprosthetic fractures include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonoperative management (eg, protected weightbearing, traction, or casting)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Revision arthroplasty</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Internal fixation (using plates, screws, wires, cables, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cortical strut grafts)</p><p/><p>Because of the inherent variability of these fractures, no single approach can be applied to all cases. Management of periprosthetic fractures must be individualized and take into consideration many factors including age and physical demands of the patient, limb alignment, fracture location, fracture pattern, bone quality, location of any bone defects, type of implant fixation (cemented versus cementless), and stability of the implant.</p><p>Nonoperative treatment is considered for stable fractures around well-fixed and functional implants (eg, nondisplaced trochanteric fracture or a longitudinal split in the proximal femur recognized incidentally on postoperative radiographs).</p><p>Operative treatment is indicated for unstable fractures and fractures associated with loose or otherwise failed prostheses. The surgical treatment of choice is usually determined by whether the stem is loose or well-fixed. If the stem is loose, revision arthroplasty with a long-stem implant is the recommended treatment. Internal fixation may be indicated for unstable fractures with a well-fixed stem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H36\"><span class=\"h2\">Implant failure or fracture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of femoral component fractures has been estimated at 0.27 percent in a retrospective survey conducted by the American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Stems utilizing modern metallurgy and manufacturing techniques have nearly eliminated stem breakage as a complication. Forged femoral components with decreased grain size, microporosity, and inclusions have greatly improved fatigue strength as compared with prior cast or annealed implants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p>Implant breakage is typically the result of deformation and fatigue fracture caused by repetitive loading (usually over the course of years). An incomplete fatigue fracture can progress to catastrophic failure with continued loading. Early femoral stem designs that utilized stainless steel with inadequate cross-sectional area and high offset were particularly vulnerable. In addition to inadequate fatigue strength of the metal, other factors that predispose to implant fracture are increased patient weight, high patient activity level, and poor implant fixation and stability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H37\"><span class=\"h2\">Leg length discrepancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Leg length discrepancy is the number one reason for lawsuits against orthopedic surgeons performing total hip arthroplasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. The incidence varies widely, ranging from 1 to 27 percent in the literature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. The problem can be concerning for both patient and surgeon. If a significant leg length discrepancy occurs, the patient may require a shoe lift to equalize the limb lengths. With significant inequality, a limp, low back pain, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the need for a cane are more common.</p><p>During total hip arthroplasty, every attempt is made to equalize leg lengths <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> restore normal leg length. Numerous factors affect perceived postoperative leg length, and true leg length should be differentiated from apparent leg length. There is no universal consensus on what constitutes a significant inequality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. Some surgeons define a significant difference as 2 cm or more. Others define a significant difference as one that adversely affects patient function. Regardless of which definition is used, special attention to this issue needs to be made preoperatively, intraoperatively, and postoperatively.</p><p>Preoperatively, leg lengths should be measured and recorded. Evaluation of outside factors affecting leg length (eg, scoliosis, pelvic obliquity, adduction contracture) should also be noted. Discussion with the patient regarding perceived leg length inequality is also important. It is imperative to discuss the risk of leg length inequality as a routine part of the preoperative informed consent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-hip-arthroplasty#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Total hip arthroplasty&quot;, section on 'Physical examination'</a>.)</p><p>Intraoperatively, there are many techniques for leg length determination. These range from special devices that measure from a fixed point on the pelvis to a simple comparison of intraoperative knee and heel positions. Intraoperative radiographs or fluoroscopy may also be very useful. Some method must be used, and redundancy is desirable. Sometimes surgeons will need to lengthen a leg because the soft tissues around the hip (mainly the abductors) are too lax. If these tissues are too lax, the hip is more likely to dislocate. Ultimately, hip stability is more important than leg length discrepancy. Most surgeons would accept a small leg length inequality in exchange for a hip that is more stable and less likely to dislocate.</p><p>Postoperatively, leg lengths should again be evaluated and measured. There is wide variability in patient perception of postoperative leg length. Some patients may perceive a significant discrepancy when true leg lengths are in fact equal. This apparent (or functional) leg length discrepancy may be due to hip muscle weakness in the early postoperative period and often resolves within a few months. These patients should be counseled regarding this, and physical therapy should emphasize progressive strengthening and stretching to help the patient return to a normal gait pattern. Some patients with a true discrepancy may require a shoe lift for the short limb, while others will not even notice an inequality that exists.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H38\"><span class=\"h2\">Heterotopic ossification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Heterotopic ossification (HO) is a process by which the soft tissues around the hip become ossified. HO that occurs in muscle is also known as myositis ossificans. Following total hip arthroplasty, HO typically occurs around the femoral neck and adjacent to the greater trochanter. HO occurs when primitive mesenchymal cells in the surrounding soft tissues are transformed into osteoblastic tissue. This tissue then forms mature lamellar bone.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H39\"><span class=\"h3\">Incidence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of HO following total hip arthroplasty varies widely and may reach up to 90 percent when evaluated in high-risk populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/69,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">69,70</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H40\"><span class=\"h3\">Risk factors for HO</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The exact trigger for HO following total hip arthroplasty is unknown, but risk factors have been identified.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HO is twice as common in males as compared with females.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients at high risk for developing HO after total hip arthroplasty include men with bilateral hypertrophic osteoarthritis, patients with a history of HO in either hip, and patients with posttraumatic arthritis characterized by hypertrophic osteophytosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients at moderate risk include those with ankylosing spondylitis, diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH), Paget disease, or unilateral hypertrophic osteoarthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other risk factors include females over the age of 65 at the time of surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>] and a lateral surgical approach to the hip [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. Although one study found that the incidence of HO was higher with cementless femoral components [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>], subsequent studies have shown that type of fixation (cemented or cementless) does not affect the incidence of HO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/75-77\" class=\"abstract_t\">75-77</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H41\"><span class=\"h3\">Symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hip stiffness is the most common complaint.

Routine use of prophylaxis is not indicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and external beam radiation have been used most successfully in preventing HO. Prophylactic measures against HO after total hip arthroplasty should be administered before the fifth postoperative day, optimally within 24 to 48 hours. The choice of NSAIDs versus radiation is typically made by the surgeon based on their experience and evaluation of risk for the patient. For example, a patient that cannot take an NSAID may preferentially receive external beam radiation.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of NSAIDs &ndash; A meta-analysis of prevention trials concluded that NSAIDs are effective in reducing the risk of post-operative HO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Indomethacin</a> is the most commonly used NSAID for HO prophylaxis, although other NSAIDs have demonstrated some effectiveness.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Limited data are available that address the relative effectiveness of selective cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitors in HO prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/83,84\" class=\"abstract_t\">83,84</a>].

A year 2004 meta-analysis of seven randomized studies that compared radiation with NSAIDs concluded that radiotherapy is more effective, but the absolute difference in the rates of clinically significant HO are quite small, on the order of 1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Vascular injury'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cement-related hypotension &ndash; The incidence of acute hypotension associated with the use of polymethylmethacrylate cement is less than 5 percent. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Cement-related hypotension'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The major potential postoperative complications include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Thromboembolic disease &ndash; Thromboembolic disease is the complication that presents the highest risk of perioperative mortality following total hip arthroplasty. Prevention is the key to minimizing the risk. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Thromboembolic disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Infection &ndash; Infection occurs in approximately 1 percent of patients following primary total hip arthroplasty; prevention is critical. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Dislocation &ndash; The risk of hip dislocation, which may occur in up to 2 percent of patients, is affected by a number of factors. The majority occur posteriorly. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Dislocation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Osteolysis and wear &ndash; Osteolysis is a process in which bone is resorbed as a biologic response to particulate debris. Newer bearing surfaces have reduced the incidence of osteolysis significantly. Periprosthetic osteolysis is typically asymptomatic unless it progresses to aseptic loosening. The treatments are surgical. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Osteolysis and wear'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Sequelae from metal-on-metal (MOM) wearing debris &ndash; MOM wear debris has been associated with numerous complications including early implant failure due to accelerated bearing wear, adverse local tissue reactions, and metal hypersensitivity reactions as well as systemic symptoms associated with elevated serum cobalt levels. (See <a href=\"#H21457382\" class=\"local\">'Sequelae from metal-on-metal wearing debris'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Aseptic loosening &ndash; The major long-term problem associated with total hip arthroplasty is loss of fixation (aseptic loosening). This is most often caused by wear of the prosthetic components, but other etiologies include poor initial stability of the implant, poor implant design, patient factors, and failure of fixation. Aseptic loosening is often associated with pain and must be differentiated from prosthetic joint infection. (See <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'Aseptic loosening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Periprosthetic fracture &ndash; Periprosthetic fracture, which occurs in proximity to an implant, is rare. Nonoperative treatment is considered for stable fractures around well-fixed and functional implants, while operative treatment is indicated for unstable fractures and fractures associated with loose or otherwise failed prostheses. (See <a href=\"#H33\" class=\"local\">'Periprosthetic fracture'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Implant <span class=\"nowrap\">failure/fracture</span> &ndash; Implant breakage is typically the result of deformation and fatigue fracture caused by repetitive loading, usually over the course of years, but stems utilizing modern metallurgy and manufacturing techniques have nearly eliminated stem breakage as a complication. (See <a href=\"#H36\" class=\"local\">'Implant failure or fracture'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Leg length discrepancy &ndash; Leg length discrepancies may require a shoe lift to equalize limb length. With significant inequality, a limp, low back pain, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the need for a cane are more common. There is no universal consensus on how to define a significant inequality. Attention should be given to this issue preoperatively, intraoperatively, and postoperatively. (See <a href=\"#H37\" class=\"local\">'Leg length discrepancy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Heterotopic ossification &ndash; Heterotopic ossification (HO) is a process by which the soft tissues around the hip become ossified. HO that occurs in muscle is also known as myositis ossificans. Following total hip arthroplasty, HO typically occurs around the femoral neck and adjacent to the greater trochanter. The incidence varies widely; multiple different factors may predict increased risk. Hip stiffness is the most common symptom. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and external beam radiation have been used most successfully in preventing HO. (See <a href=\"#H38\" class=\"local\">'Heterotopic ossification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2120327328\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Thomas Thornhill, MD, and Jeffrey Katz, MD, MSc, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-total-hip-arthroplasty/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Saleh KJ, Kassim R, Yoon P, Vorlicky LN.
