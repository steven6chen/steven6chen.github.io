Their pKa values range from 3.50 (aspirin) to 4.85 (ibuprofen). As such, they are not ionized at the acidic pH found in the gastric lumen and thus can be absorbed across the gastric mucosa. Once these drugs move from the acidic environment of the gastric lumen into the pH&ndash;neutral mucosa, the drugs ionize and are trapped temporarily in epithelial cells where it may damage these cells.</p><p>However, this &quot;topical&quot; epithelial injury by many NSAIDs does not appear to be of prime importance in the pathogenesis of clinically important endpoints (symptomatic ulcers). The pathogenesis of symptomatic peptic ulcer disease caused by repeated exposure to NSAIDs is mainly a consequence of systemic (post-absorptive) inhibition of gastrointestinal mucosal cyclo-oxygenase (COX) activity. Even intravenous or intramuscular administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> or NSAIDs can cause gastric or duodenal ulcers in animals and humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-pathogenesis-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">THE CENTRAL PROTECTIVE ROLE OF CYCLO-OXYGENASE PRODUCTS (PROSTAGLANDINS)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cyclo-oxygenase (COX), the rate-limiting enzyme in prostaglandin (PG) synthesis, converts the unsaturated fatty acid arachidonic acid (C20:4) (derived from phospholipids in cell membranes) into PGG2 and then to PGH2 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F66146\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66146 \">figure 1</a>). The gastric and duodenal mucosa proceed to convert PGH2 to various prostanoids (prostaglandins and thromboxane A2). PGs such as PGE2 protect the mucosal lining from injury by luminal acid-pepsin.</p><p>There are two functional forms of COX in the human body, COX-1 and COX-2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-pathogenesis-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. These two proteins are 50 to 60 percent homologous and are coded on different chromosomes (9 and 1, respectively). COX-1 is a constitutive enzyme with a fairly steady rate of expression in most cells of the body. In contrast, COX-2 is produced in many cells only when bacterial polysaccharides (endotoxin), pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNFa or IL-1b, or growth factors (mitogens) induce COX-2 expression. </p><p>The healthy gastric and duodenal mucosa constitutively use COX-1 to produce its mucosal-protective PGs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-pathogenesis-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Many NSAIDs block COX-1 and COX-2 more or less equally (ie, are non-selective) and thus may impair gastric PG production at low concentrations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F54253\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54253 \">table 1</a>). Selective inhibitors of COX-2, may better preserve PG-mediated gastrointestinal mucosal protection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F54253\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54253 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-pathogenesis-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>].

While it is true that certain PGs such as PGE2 reduce gastric acid secretion, hypochlorhydria does not entirely explain the mucosal protection observed with PGE2. In animals, for example, doses of PGE2 far too low to inhibit gastric acid secretion profoundly protect against gastric injury induced by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, alcohol, and other gastric irritants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-pathogenesis-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This non-antisecretory effect of PGs has been referred to as &quot;cytoprotection&quot;. Some of the cytoprotective mechanisms of PGs include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stimulation of glycoprotein (mucin) secretion by epithelial cells</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stimulation of bicarbonate secretion by epithelial cells</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stimulation of phospholipid secretion by epithelial cells</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enhancement of mucosal blood flow and oxygen delivery to epithelial cells via local vasodilation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased epithelial cell migration towards the luminal surface (restitution)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enhanced epithelial cell proliferation</p><p/><p>The first two mechanisms, stimulation of epithelial mucin and bicarbonate secretion, combine to form an alkaline, unstirred water layer on the surface of the gastric mucosa, which retards diffusion of acid-pepsin from the lumen into the mucosa. Gastric and duodenal injury by acid and pepsin may occur when these protective functions are compromised as a consequence of PG deficiency induced by a COX-1 inhibiting nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) or, experimentally, by antibodies to PGs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-pathogenesis-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. This damage may eventually lead to gastric <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> duodenal ulcer formation, with or without serious ulcer complications (bleeding, perforation, and obstruction).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">ROLE OF NITRIC OXIDE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Generation of nitric oxide (NO) by NO synthase (NOS) may be a key intermediate in cytoprotection. Similar to the role of COX-1, constitutive NO synthase (NOS) is important in the maintenance of an intact mucosal lining. Two enzymes contribute to the basal, constitutive NOS activity: neuronal NOS (nNOS, type I) and endothelial NOS (eNOS, type III). The cytoprotective mechanisms of NO parallel prostaglandin (PG) effects and include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mediation of the release of gastric mucin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stimulation of alkaline fluid secretion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintenance of epithelial barrier function</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enhancement of mucosal blood flow</p><p/><p>In some but not all models, inducible NO synthase (iNOS, type II) produces high levels of NO leading to physiological responses that are often quite different than seen in the basal state. Inducible NOS is generally associated with inflammatory states, similar to COX-2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-pathogenesis-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, the relationship between the various NOS forms and COX enzymes has not been fully elucidated. Most studies implicate both constitutive and inducible enzymes in the maintenance of gastric mucosal integrity as well as in epithelial restitution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-pathogenesis-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Manipulation of NO levels in models of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced mucosal damage suggest a protective role for both NO and PGs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-pathogenesis-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p>Because of the importance of NO in mucosal defense, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> or NSAIDs coupled to NO themselves or to NO donors (some of which also release hydrogen sulfide) have been developed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-pathogenesis-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECTRUM OF GASTRODUODENAL MUCOSAL INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Injury to the stomach or duodenum by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can range from subtle alterations in gastric mucosal barrier function through microscopic damage to surface cells to gross injury visible through an endoscope or at the time of surgery for an ulcer complication.</p><p>The most subtle change is disruption of mucosal barrier function, manifest as increased mucosal permeability to hydrogen ions (which then diffuse more rapidly from the lumen into the mucosa) and to sodium ions (which then diffuse more rapidly from the mucosa into the lumen). Disruption of the gastric mucosal barrier and the resultant damage to surface cells by gastric acid may result in macroscopic injury over time if repair mechanisms are ineffective.</p><p>Repair mechanisms include rapid migration of deeper epithelial cells lining gastric pits to cover the damaged surface (restitution) and less rapid regeneration of new epithelial cells from progenitor cells (proliferation). Epithelial restitution and proliferation both require adequate amounts of well-oxygenated blood at a pH close to 7.4. Prostaglandins (PGs) and nitric oxide (NO) have important roles in these repair mechanisms, while COX inhibitors can disrupt these PG-dependent reparative processes. Gastric restitution has been associated with induction of COX-2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-pathogenesis-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The importance of the inhibition of COX-2 on gastric restitution in NSAID-induced injury is not yet known.</p><p>Aspirin-induced gastric injury is also associated with inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which may reduce angiogenesis, inhibition of autophagy (an adaptive response to cell stress that can promote cell survival), and enhanced gastric cell apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-pathogenesis-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p>Macroscopic injury by NSAIDs ranges from edema, erythema, subepithelial hemorrhage, erosions (mucosal breaks, without visible depth to the lesion), and ulcers (mucosal breaks, with visible depth to the lesion). Only <span class=\"nowrap\">erosive/ulcerative</span> lesions are considered clinically important, although lesser lesions may be precursors of erosive lesions if reparative mechanisms fail. Development of the full spectrum of lesions in the PG-depleted stomach or duodenum requires acid and pepsin; potent acid inhibition (eg, with PPIs) markedly protects against their development.

Epidemiologic and placebo-controlled studies indicate that the risk of serious, clinically-relevant gastrointestinal damage increases as the aspirin dose is raised [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-pathogenesis-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity/abstract/7,24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,24,25</a>].</p><p>After low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> therapy is stopped, the human stomach requires five to eight days to recover its COX-1 activity and its ability to synthesize protective PGs, suggesting a very slow turnover of gastric COX-1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-pathogenesis-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Thus, gastric mucosa somewhat resembles the platelet, which requires 10 to 14 days to recover from aspirin.</p><p>Although <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> inhibits COX-1 and also COX-2 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F54253\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54253 \">table 1</a>), certain COX-2-mediated reactions can still occur after aspirin has been given, such as the conversion of arachidonic acid to the fatty acid 15-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (15-HETE); 15-HETE is then converted to 15-epi lipoxin A4 by another enzyme, 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX). Studies in animals have demonstrated enhanced production of 15-epi lipoxin A4 following aspirin exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-pathogenesis-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Furthermore, this lipoxin minimizes gastric damage by aspirin (ie, it is cytoprotective). This protective effect of 15-epi lipoxin A4 can be abolished (with more gastric damage resulting) by administering a selective COX-2 inhibitor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-pathogenesis-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Therefore, the combination of low-dose aspirin and a COX-2 selective inhibitor may lead to more gastrointestinal damage than low-dose aspirin alone.</p><p>In contrast to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, which acetylates COX irreversibly, most NSAIDs inhibit COX-1 and COX&ndash;2 reversibly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-pathogenesis-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Nevertheless, even transient COX inhibition in the gastric mucosa by an NSAID is sufficient to predispose the stomach to injury. That this injury is due to loss of PG-mediated cytoprotection is supported by the observation that NSAID-related gastric damage is prevented by PGE analogs such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a>&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-pathogenesis-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Misoprostol</a> does not primarily protect the stomach by inhibiting its ability to produce hydrochloric acid because drugs that inhibit gastric acid secretion to the same or slightly greater extent as misoprostol, such as histamine-2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs), have little or no protective effect against NSAID-induced gastric damage. On the other hand, the relative failure of H2RAs to protect the stomach from damage by NSAIDs may be overcome by using higher H2RA doses or by using more potent acid-inhibitory compounds such as the proton pump inhibitors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-including-aspirin-primary-prevention-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs (including aspirin): Primary prevention of gastroduodenal toxicity&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Duodenal damage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Aspirin</a> doses as low as 325 mg every other day increase the risk of duodenal ulcers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-pathogenesis-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In contrast to the stomach, damage to the duodenal mucosa by aspirin and NSAIDs seems to depend highly upon gastric acid.

As an example, interference with factors that mediate restitution or adaptive protection may contribute to mucosal injury.</p><p>Adaptive protection refers to the observation that mild gastric irritants induce enhanced cytoprotection. COX-1, COX-2, and NO as well as various growth factors, such as transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta and TGF-alpha, appear to participate in these adaptive processes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-pathogenesis-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

Patients in both groups were equally likely to remain ulcer free at six months (56 versus 53 percent). Furthermore, fewer baseline gastric ulcers (but not duodenal ulcers) healed among patients who underwent H. pylori eradication. The failure of H. pylori eradication to enhance ulcer healing at six months was unexpected and unexplained.</p><p/><p>Recommendations regarding H. pylori testing in patients taking requiring NSAIDs are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-including-aspirin-primary-prevention-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs (including aspirin): Primary prevention of gastroduodenal toxicity&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK OF GASTROINTESTINAL COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk for the development of significant nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID)-induced gastrointestinal bleeding or perforation due to a peptic ulcer has been evaluated in multiple studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-pathogenesis-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity/abstract/29,44-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,44-59</a>]. An important determinant is the duration of therapy. Administration of NSAIDs for a short period of time (less than one week) in healthy people is unlikely to result in any clinically significant gastroduodenal toxicity. Longer duration of therapy is associated with an increased risk of developing complications. On the other hand, gastroduodenal complications are most common within the first three months after the initiation of therapy. Gastroduodenal toxicity may develop even in patients taking low doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-pathogenesis-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>], which, can be associated with a significant decrease in gastric mucosal prostaglandin concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-pathogenesis-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-in-the-primary-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-cancer#H1761566\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aspirin in the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer&quot;, section on 'Adverse effects'</a>.)</p><p>Besides duration of exposure, a number of other factors are associated with an increased risk of gastroduodenal toxicity and complications from NSAIDs. These include increasing age, higher NSAID dose(s), a past history of gastroduodenal toxicity from NSAIDs, a past history of peptic ulcer disease, and concurrent use of glucocorticoids, anticoagulants, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a> (and probably bisphosphonates and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors [SSRIs] as well) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-pathogenesis-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity/abstract/29,44,56,58-64\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,44,56,58-64</a>].</p><p>Studies have suggested that SSRIs are associated with an increased risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, particularly in patients taking NSAIDs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-pathogenesis-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity/abstract/60-62,64-68\" class=\"abstract_t\">60-62,64-68</a>]. A possible mechanism is platelet serotonin depletion, which may adversely influence the hemostatic response to vascular injury (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hemostasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hemostasis&quot;</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-pathogenesis-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. In a meta-analysis that included 15 case-control studies and 4 cohort studies, the use of SSRIs was associated with an increased risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding compared with not using an SSRI (odds ratio [OR] for case-control studies 1.7, 95% CI 1.4-1.92; OR for cohort studies 1.7, 95% CI 1.1-2.5) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-pathogenesis-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. When the analysis was confined to patients receiving NSAIDs, the risk was even higher (OR 4.3, 95% CI 2.8-6.4). With respect to NSAID dose, the risk of toxicity with &quot;over-the-counter&quot; NSAIDs taken at recommended doses appears to be lower than with prescription NSAIDs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-pathogenesis-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].</p><p>The risk of toxicity may not be uniform among the NSAIDs. Many studies of varying design have described gastrointestinal toxicity of different NSAIDs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-including-aspirin-primary-prevention-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity#H2134667089\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs (including aspirin): Primary prevention of gastroduodenal toxicity&quot;, section on 'Nonselective NSAIDs'</a>.)</p><p>Genetic predisposition to gastroduodenal injury due to polymorphism of cytochrome P450 2C9 may delay the metabolism of several NSAIDs, with a prolonged duration of drug exposure enhancing the ulcerogenic effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-pathogenesis-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].

These guidelines are discussed elsewhere.

On the other hand, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and nonacetylated salicylates, many NSAIDs, and even <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-pathogenesis-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], may produce dyspeptic symptoms (epigastric discomfort, upper abdominal pain, nausea, epigastric fullness or bloating), especially as the dose of the drug is increased.</p><p>There is little correlation between the dyspeptic symptoms sometimes seen with these drugs and the presence or absence of <span class=\"nowrap\">erosive/ulcerative</span> lesions in the stomach and duodenum. Two examples illustrate this point. First, patients may present with severe ulcer complications from an NSAID with no preceding dyspeptic &quot;warning&quot; symptoms. Second, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> and salicylsalicylic acid (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=salsalate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">salsalate</a>) commonly produce dyspepsia, especially when used in higher doses, but neither blocks gastric COX activity over a wide range of doses or causes damage to the gastric mucosa (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F54253\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54253 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nsaids-including-aspirin-pathogenesis-of-gastroduodenal-toxicity/abstract/6,9,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,9,70</a>].</p><p>These observations emphasize that studies evaluating gastric and duodenal toxicity of NSAIDs should not include dyspepsia as a part of a combined gastrointestinal endpoint. In most instances the mechanism for the drug-related dyspepsia has not been determined. Dyspepsia and ulcer formation should be viewed as separate issues when using analgesic drugs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5th to 6th grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.
