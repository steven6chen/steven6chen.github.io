This topic will review the anesthesiologist's preoperative evaluation of a cardiac surgical patient. This includes assessing cardiac and overall health risks, identifying issues that could cause problems during and after surgery, working with the cardiologist and cardiac surgeon to optimize medical conditions, developing an anesthetic care plan, educating the patient regarding anesthetic care, and alleviating patient anxiety. Intraoperative anesthetic management for cardiac surgical procedures (eg, coronary artery bypass grafting [CABG] and cardiac valve surgery) is discussed separately.

These patients are usually hospitalized in the coronary care unit and may be receiving heparin and antiplatelet medications.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If the patient presents within six hours of symptom onset and has multiple coronary lesions, urgent surgical revascularization may maximize myocardial salvage. If the patient presents later than six hours after symptom onset, myocardial necrosis has already reached its peak. In these cases, surgery is usually delayed for three to four days in order to possibly improve operative morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preanesthetic-consultation-for-cardiac-surgery-in-adults/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].

Examples include refractory angina despite maximal medical therapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> intraaortic balloon counterpulsation (IABP); ongoing myocardial ischemia after unsuccessful or complicated percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI); or cardiogenic shock due to severe left or right ventricular dysfunction, acute severe mitral regurgitation, or rupture of the left ventricular free wall or interventricular septum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preanesthetic-consultation-for-cardiac-surgery-in-adults/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>].

LV systolic function is a known predictor of morbidity and mortality in cardiac surgery and is incorporated into most risk prediction models (see <a href=\"#H621846314\" class=\"local\">'Risk calculators'</a> below). Although RV functional parameters are not incorporated in commonly used risk models, several retrospective and small prospective studies have demonstrated that RV dysfunction is associated with poor outcomes after cardiac surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preanesthetic-consultation-for-cardiac-surgery-in-adults/abstract/8-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Concomitant pulmonary hypertension</strong> &ndash; Pulmonary hypertension (PHT), defined as mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) &gt;25 mmHg at rest, increases morbidity and mortality risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preanesthetic-consultation-for-cardiac-surgery-in-adults/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>] and is included in the Parsonnet and Euroscore II risk models (see <a href=\"#H621846314\" class=\"local\">'Risk calculators'</a> below).

Preoperative strategies to minimize this risk include ensuring that doses of chronically administered beta blockers and statins were received on the morning of surgery (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-therapy-to-prevent-complications-after-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical therapy to prevent complications after coronary artery bypass graft surgery&quot;</a>).

Concomitant CEA and CABG surgery necessitates coordination between the anesthesiologist and both the vascular and cardiac surgical teams so that everyone understands the planned sequence of procedures. Important considerations include continuation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, beta blockers, and statins throughout the perioperative period, as well as ensuring that central venous access is obtained on the side contralateral to the carotid occlusion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H972386304\"><span class=\"h4\">Proximal aortic atherosclerosis or calcification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with significant coronary <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> carotid atherosclerotic disease may also have significant atherosclerosis or calcification of the proximal or ascending aorta. Typically, this is evident on chest radiograph (CXR) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> other imaging studies obtained in the preoperative period (eg, computed tomography [CT] imaging of the chest). During cardiac surgery, thrombi or atheromatous debris can be released from large or mobile aortic plaques during graft anastomoses, clamping and unclamping of the ascending aorta, or by turbulent high-velocity blood flow delivered via the aortic cannula into a diseased aorta. Since the degree of aortic manipulation has been associated with increased stroke rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preanesthetic-consultation-for-cardiac-surgery-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>], the cardiac surgeon may decide to employ off-pump coronary artery bypass (OPCAB) grafting in order to avoid cannulation, crossclamping of the atherosclerotic aorta, and the need for CPB.</p><p>In patients with possible or known proximal aortic disease, the cardiac anesthesiologist plans to perform a thorough intraoperative transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) assessment for aortic atheromas, with particular attention to areas where surgical manipulation may occur (eg, aortic clamping, aortic cannulation, aortic valve incisions, proximal coronary graft anastomoses, and insertion of antegrade cardioplegia catheters). This facilitates intraoperative surgical decision-making regarding choice of techniques that avoid manipulation of diseased areas. Contraindications to placement of a TEE probe (eg, dysphagia or odynophagia) are discussed below (see <a href=\"#H545157463\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> below).&nbsp;In all cases, the potential benefit from TEE images must be weighed against the relative risk of injury during placement and manipulation of the TEE probe.</p><p>In addition, the surgical and anesthesia teams may jointly plan to employ epiaortic scanning. This requires insertion of a high-resolution (&gt;7 MHz) ultrasound transducer into a sterile sheath filled with either sterile saline or ultrasound transmission gel before placement directly on the exposed aorta for examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preanesthetic-consultation-for-cardiac-surgery-in-adults/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].
