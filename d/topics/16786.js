TWA therefore reflects sudden changes in temporal heterogeneity in ventricular repolarization, which is an important mechanism underlying reentrant arrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-wave-repolarization-alternans-clinical-aspects/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>Despite the term &quot;T-wave&quot; alternans, alternating behavior may also involve the ST segment and U wave (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52566\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52566 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-wave-repolarization-alternans-clinical-aspects/abstract/2,5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5-8</a>]. As a result, the term ventricular repolarization alternans may be more accurate, but is rarely used.</p><p>TWA of sufficient magnitude to be seen with visual inspection is uncommon. With the development of computerized filtering and spectral analysis tools, TWA on the order of microvolts can be detected (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F113078\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113078 \">figure 2</a>), and microvolt TWA (MTWA, now often used synonymously with TWA) is both sensitive and specific for predicting ventricular arrhythmias in a number of clinical scenarios [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-wave-repolarization-alternans-clinical-aspects/abstract/1,2,7,9-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,7,9-16</a>]. </p><p>Clinical risk stratification for sudden cardiac death typically focuses on the presence of a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction and the presence of heart failure. However, these parameters identify only a minority of individuals who will die suddenly, and also identify others who will not suffer lethal ventricular arrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-wave-repolarization-alternans-clinical-aspects/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. As a result, there is continued interest in additional electrophysiologic indices for risk prediction, of which one of the most promising remains TWA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-wave-repolarization-alternans-clinical-aspects/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The clinical utility of TWA will be reviewed here. The technical aspects and methods for analyzing TWA are discussed separately.

The greatest utility of TWA lies in its high negative predictive value and therefore in identifying low-risk individuals. In contemporary practice, our approach is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We do not perform TWA testing as a screening tool to assess for the risk of ventricular arrhythmias in the general population without known coronary heart disease (CHD). This primarily relates to the relatively low risk of ventricular tachycardia (VT) and sudden cardiac death (SCD) in the general population.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We do not routinely perform TWA testing in all patients with known CHD.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We do not routinely perform TWA testing in all patients who otherwise meet criteria for a primary prevention implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), as it is not known if the negative predictive value is high enough to withhold ICD implantation in patients who otherwise meet ICD implantation criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-wave-repolarization-alternans-clinical-aspects/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. This approach is in agreement with the 2008 American Heart <span class=\"nowrap\">Association/American</span> College of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/Heart</span> Rhythm Society <span class=\"nowrap\">(AHA/ACC/HRS)</span> scientific statement on noninvasive risk stratification, which concluded that a moderate amount of data suggest that TWA may be useful for risk stratification for SCD, but that further information will be needed to determine the clinical applicability of this test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-wave-repolarization-alternans-clinical-aspects/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We perform TWA testing in patients who meet established criteria for a primary prevention ICD but who are reluctant to proceed with the procedure. Positive (abnormal) TWA results in this setting may be helpful in risk stratifying the patient to a higher risk category, while negative (normal) TWA results may be used to reassure the patient of a relatively lower risk of VT.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We perform TWA testing in patients with known or suspected long QT syndrome (LQTS) as part of the evaluation for diagnostic and risk stratification purposes. A 2016 study demonstrated that the presence of microvolt TWA is more common in patients with LQTS than previously reported and may be associated with a prior history of torsade de pointes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-wave-repolarization-alternans-clinical-aspects/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Most of the focus of such efforts has been on patients with prior myocardial infarction (MI), reduced left ventricular (LV) ejection fraction, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> symptomatic heart failure (HF) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-wave-repolarization-alternans-clinical-aspects/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. </p><p>TWA was first linked to ventricular arrhythmias in the early 1900s in cases that were evident on visual inspection of the electrocardiogram (ECG) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-wave-repolarization-alternans-clinical-aspects/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Visually apparent TWA was subsequently reported in a variety of settings including ischemia and long QT syndrome (LQTS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-wave-repolarization-alternans-clinical-aspects/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. TWA may accompany pulsus (mechanical) alternans in severe cardiac failure, but may occur without mechanical alternans, and vice versa.

Studies show that the negative predictive value of TWA for arrhythmic events occurring within one year exceeds 90 percent (range 90 to 99 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-wave-repolarization-alternans-clinical-aspects/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Screening unselected populations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several attempts have been made to extend current implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) risk-stratification guidelines to unselected patients.

Both abnormal TWA and abnormal TWA combined with abnormal heart rate recovery were associated with an increased risk for cardiovascular death (relative risk [RR] 5.0, 95% CI 2.1-12.1 and 6.1, 95% CI 2.8-13.2, respectively).

In general, such patients (with or without prior MI) represent the population most extensively studied for ventricular arrhythmia risk stratification using TWA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-wave-repolarization-alternans-clinical-aspects/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]. Based upon the available data, we do not routinely proceed with TWA testing in all patients with CHD. However, we consider TWA testing for additional risk stratification in high-risk patients who are candidates for an ICD for primary prevention of sudden cardiac death but who are reluctant to proceed with ICD implantation. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Further risk stratifying candidates for ICD'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-death-in-heart-failure-and-cardiomyopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary prevention of sudden cardiac death in heart failure and cardiomyopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The following observations illustrate the range of findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a prospective study of 102 patients with a recent (7 to 30 days) MI (follow-up 13 months), the risk of sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) or ventricular fibrillation (VF) was increased in patients with TWA, particularly those who also had late potentials (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F71874\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71874 \">figure 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F51831\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51831 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-wave-repolarization-alternans-clinical-aspects/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The sensitivity and specificity of TWA for predicting arrhythmic events were 93 and 59 percent, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a multicenter study of 850 consecutive MI survivors, TWA was assessed at 2 to 10 weeks in 701 patients, and from several months to two years in 149 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-wave-repolarization-alternans-clinical-aspects/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The risk of death or resuscitated VF was predicted best by TWA (RR 5.9) and a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &lt;40 percent (RR 4.4). The sensitivity and specificity of TWA for predicting arrhythmic events were 92 and 61 percent. TWA was also predictive of arrhythmic events in a larger series limited to post-MI patients with a preserved ejection fraction (LVEF &ge;40 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-wave-repolarization-alternans-clinical-aspects/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a large observational study of 768 high-risk patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy (over 80 percent had a prior MI, average LVEF was 27 percent, and 51 percent had an ICD) with a mean follow-up of 18 months, a non-negative TWA result was associated with increased all-cause and arrhythmic mortality (adjusted HR 2.24 and 2.29, respectively, compared with patients with a negative TWA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-wave-repolarization-alternans-clinical-aspects/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. </p><p/><p>These results provide evidence that TWA retains independent prognostic value when applied to a high-risk population. In theory, there is considerable evidence that alterations in autonomic balance, with a sympathetic predominance evidenced by heart rate variability analysis, may precede spontaneous ventricular arrhythmias and hence augment TWA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-wave-repolarization-alternans-clinical-aspects/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. This has been demonstrated by some authors, while beta blockers are known to suppress TWA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-wave-repolarization-alternans-clinical-aspects/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. A general discussion of risk stratification for arrhythmic death after MI is presented separately.

Systolic dysfunction (LVEF &le;40 percent) identifies patients with ischemic and nonischemic cardiomyopathy who are at risk for serious ventricular tachyarrhythmias and SCD. We do not routinely perform TWA testing in all patients who otherwise meet criteria for a primary prevention ICD, as it is not known if the negative predictive value is high enough to withhold ICD implantation in patients who otherwise meet ICD implantation criteria. The data supporting these conclusions are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=incidence-of-and-risk-stratification-for-sudden-cardiac-death-after-acute-myocardial-infarction#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Incidence of and risk stratification for sudden cardiac death after acute myocardial infarction&quot;, section on 'LV dysfunction'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ventricular-arrhythmias-in-heart-failure-and-cardiomyopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ventricular arrhythmias in heart failure and cardiomyopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Multivariate analyses have shown that TWA predicts ventricular arrhythmias independent of reduced LVEF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-wave-repolarization-alternans-clinical-aspects/abstract/2,13,33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,13,33,34</a>], albeit in varying populations. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a series of 850 post-MI patients, the sensitivity and specificity of an LVEF &lt;40 percent for ventricular tachyarrhythmias were 56 and 83 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-wave-repolarization-alternans-clinical-aspects/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

TWA-guided therapy achieved one-year positive (9 percent) and negative (95 percent) predictive values comparable with those from electrophysiology study (EPS) guided therapy (11 percent and 95 percent, respectively). Arrhythmic event rates were significantly higher in patients with a positive TWA (HR 2.1) or positive EPS (HR 2.4), although with positive predictive values of around 10 percent. Moreover, event rates in patients with negative TWA and EPS were lower than in those with two positive tests (2 versus 12 percent). The authors concluded that ICD implantation was equally effective whether guided by noninvasive MTWA or invasive EPS at one year, and complementary when both tests were combined.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the TWA in CHF study, which included 549 patients with ischemic and nonischemic cardiomyopathy who were followed for an average of 20 months, patients with abnormal TWA were more likely to die or experience sustained VT (HR 6.5, 95% CI 2.4-18.1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-wave-repolarization-alternans-clinical-aspects/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p/><p>Several studies have suggested that TWA predicts spontaneous ventricular arrhythmias and mortality in patients with LV dysfunction that is nonischemic or out of proportion to the extent of CHD. In a report of 137 patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy, the presence of TWA predicted the combined endpoint of sudden death, resuscitated VF, or documented hemodynamically unstable VT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-wave-repolarization-alternans-clinical-aspects/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Additionally, the presence of HF predicts worse outcomes independent of LV function, and TWA predicts arrhythmic events in patients with HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-wave-repolarization-alternans-clinical-aspects/abstract/43-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-46</a>].

TWA retained a high negative predictive value for the combined endpoint, although the overall event rate of the population was also very low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-wave-repolarization-alternans-clinical-aspects/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Further risk stratifying candidates for ICD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is ongoing interest in further risk stratification of patients who meet criteria for ICD therapy based upon MADIT II (LVEF &le;30 percent due to a prior MI) and SCD-HeFT (LVEF &le;35 percent due to any cause with associated NYHA class II or III HF) criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-wave-repolarization-alternans-clinical-aspects/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. Although each of these trials demonstrated mortality benefit with ICD therapy in their respective populations, the absolute benefit was lower than that seen in the earlier MUSTT and MADIT I trials, suggesting that subsets of patients with lower individual risk are included within the population encompassed by MADIT II and SCD-HeFT inclusion criteria.

Over a mean follow-up of 17 months, there was significant increase in SCD in patients with TWA (15.6 versus 0 percent without TWA).

These studies demonstrated that the presence of TWA during atrial or ventricular pacing or exercise correlated with the ability to induce ventricular arrhythmias in patients undergoing EP testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-wave-repolarization-alternans-clinical-aspects/abstract/2,11,13,14,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,11,13,14,16</a>].</p><p>Abnormal TWA results have been associated with relatively high sensitivity and specificity (both between 75 and 85 percent) for the prediction of inducible VT or VF during invasive EP testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-wave-repolarization-alternans-clinical-aspects/abstract/2,13,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,13,16</a>].

TWA of this nature has been shown to precede the onset of tachycardia-dependent torsade de pointes.

This was accompanied by significant increases in the dispersion of repolarization between epicardial and midmyocardial regions compared with baseline. A similar mechanism has been observed in patients with congenital LQTS following abrupt heart rate acceleration, in which it was shown that successive beats may encroach upon refractoriness resulting from repolarization dispersion to cause functional conduction block and reentry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-wave-repolarization-alternans-clinical-aspects/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p/><p>Further study is required to delineate the mechanisms underlying TWA in LQTS, the predictive value of TWA for arrhythmic events in each genotypic form, and whether the disappearance of TWA is a surrogate for effective therapy such as beta blockers.

Such patients have been shown to have an elevated risk of ventricular arrhythmias, particularly patients with coronary disease and reduced ejection fraction. Frequently, positive and indeterminate TWA tests (ie, non-negative) are often grouped together to provide a &quot;high-risk&quot; group. When using modified moving average analysis (MMA), TWA in upper quartiles for that population are used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-wave-repolarization-alternans-clinical-aspects/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2107381905\"><span class=\"h2\">Indeterminate TWA results</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 20 to 40 percent of TWA alternans tests are classified as &quot;indeterminate,&quot; in that the results of the test do not demonstrate or exclude the presence of TWA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-wave-repolarization-alternans-clinical-aspects/abstract/12,13,42,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13,42,63</a>]. In the early literature, tests were considered indeterminate based upon patient factors (eg, frequent ventricular ectopy or inability to achieve the target heart rate), as well as technical factors (eg, significant artifact on the electrocardiogram). Subsequently, it has been recommended that patients be immediately retested if results are indeterminate.</p><p>The high incidence of indeterminate results has been a challenge in the clinical application of TWA by the spectral method. Some investigators have included indeterminate results with abnormal studies, under the category &quot;non-negative.&quot; This approach is supported by observations that outcomes are similar in patients with abnormal TWA and those with indeterminate studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-wave-repolarization-alternans-clinical-aspects/abstract/33,36,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,36,64</a>], if the indeterminacy is caused by patient-related rather than technical factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/t-wave-repolarization-alternans-clinical-aspects/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p>These observations support the premise that TWA testing is most useful for identifying patients at a low risk of ventricular arrhythmias via its negative results.
