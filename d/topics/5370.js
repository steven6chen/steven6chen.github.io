The diagnosis may be readily apparent in patients with a clear history of exposure to a known or likely allergen in the minutes or few hours preceding onset of characteristic symptoms in several body systems. However, anaphylaxis is not always easy to diagnose, as the symptoms and signs overlap with those of many other disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-anaphylaxis-in-children-and-adults/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>Disorders that may present with similar symptoms and signs to anaphylaxis in children and adults will be reviewed here. The differential diagnosis of anaphylaxis in infants (ie, children under two years of age) and in pregnant women during labor and delivery is reviewed elsewhere. The rapid recognition and acute treatment of anaphylaxis are also presented separately.

These symptoms and signs may include itching, flushing, urticaria, angioedema, hoarseness, throat tightness, stridor, wheezing, coughing, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, vomiting, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypotension, dizziness, or collapse (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F66333\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66333 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-emergency-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anaphylaxis: Emergency treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Involvement of body organ systems varies among patients and even in the same patient from one episode to another. However, review of anaphylaxis case series and study cohorts reveals that episodes involve the skin and mucosa in up to 90 percent, respiratory tract in up to 70 percent, gastrointestinal tract in up to 45 percent, cardiovascular system in up to 72 percent, and central nervous system (CNS) in up to 15 percent of episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-anaphylaxis-in-children-and-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>If the patient is seen after resolution of the acute anaphylactic episode (eg, in the clinician's office weeks or months later), the relevant emergency medical services and emergency department records should be obtained and reviewed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-anaphylaxis-in-children-and-adults/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24666099\"><span class=\"h1\">LABORATORY TESTS TO CONFIRM THE DIAGNOSIS OF ANAPHYLAXIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The history is the most important element in the evaluation. In some patients, the diagnosis of anaphylaxis can be confirmed or anaphylaxis can be distinguished from other disorders with similar symptoms by laboratory tests. Elevations in plasma histamine occur within 5 to 15 minutes of the onset of anaphylaxis symptoms and then decline to baseline by 60 minutes due to rapid metabolism, making it difficult to obtain quickly enough to aid in the diagnosis. However, elevations in serum tryptase occur later and are more prolonged. Serum or plasma for tryptase measurement should be obtained within 15 minutes to 3 hours of symptom onset. The blood sample should be placed on ice if the assay is to be performed on site or frozen if it is to be sent to a reference laboratory.</p><p>Elevated tryptase levels are most likely to be detected in anaphylaxis triggered by stinging insect venoms or injected medications and during anaphylaxis with hypotension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-anaphylaxis-in-children-and-adults/abstract/2,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5</a>]. In a study of more than 100 consecutive adults with clearly-defined anaphylaxis (mean age 44 years), in which the most common triggers were medication, venom, and food, tryptase levels were elevated in 62 percent of the patients. The elevated levels were measured in blood samples obtained one to two hours after symptom onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-anaphylaxis-in-children-and-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Tryptase levels are seldom elevated in children, patients with food-induced anaphylaxis, or those who remained normotensive during an anaphylactic episode. Thus, tryptase levels that are within normal limits cannot be used to exclude the clinical diagnosis of anaphylaxis. The interpretation of serum tryptase levels is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laboratory-tests-to-support-the-clinical-diagnosis-of-anaphylaxis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laboratory tests to support the clinical diagnosis of anaphylaxis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Tryptase levels can also be transiently increased in some patients with myocardial infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-anaphylaxis-in-children-and-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] and increased at baseline in patients with mast cell activation disorders and some other hematologic disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-anaphylaxis-in-children-and-adults/abstract/2,4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,5</a>]. Thus, the serum tryptase level alone cannot rule in or rule out anaphylaxis and must be interpreted in the context of the clinical presentation.

Additionally, anaphylaxis may rarely present as sudden collapse without cutaneous symptoms and may be misdiagnosed as other entities that present with presyncope or syncope. Other differential diagnosis, including choking and foreign body aspiration, are important considerations, particularly in infants and young children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-anaphylaxis-in-children-and-adults/abstract/2,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5</a>].

If the urticaria is triggered by an allergic reaction to a food, drug, or stinging insect, it is still appropriate for patients to carry self-injectable <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> in case a future episode involves respiratory or cardiovascular symptoms.</p><p>Urticaria, with or without angioedema, is limited to the skin and subcutaneous tissues. Urticaria can be associated with infections or be caused by physical stimuli, such as heat and cold. The various allergic and nonallergic disorders associated with angioedema are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=an-overview-of-angioedema-pathogenesis-and-causes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;An overview of angioedema: Pathogenesis and causes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with bradykinin-mediated hereditary or acquired angioedema (C1 inhibitor deficiency) or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor-induced angioedema have intermittent episodes of swelling not associated with itching or erythema. Episodes of angioedema develop in the deep cutaneous or mucosal tissues of the face, extremities, or genitalia, as well as the tongue and larynx, potentially leading to life-threatening asphyxia. Angioedema may also affect the bowel wall, leading to recurrent abdominal pain that varies in severity from mild discomfort to severe intractable pain accompanied by vomiting, diarrhea, and hypovolemic shock. In C1 deficiency angioedema, complement (C4) levels are reduced during acute attacks, and C4 is usually low even between episodes. C1-esterase inhibitor is deficient or functionally absent in most patients with this condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-anaphylaxis-in-children-and-adults/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>].

The diagnosis of anaphylaxis should also be considered in patients who present within minutes to a few hours after exposure to a likely or known allergen trigger; for example, a food, medication, or insect sting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/differential-diagnosis-of-anaphylaxis-in-children-and-adults/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24666134\"><span class=\"h3\">Vasovagal syncope</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Syncope (faint) may be a symptom of anaphylaxis or may occur as an isolated problem.
