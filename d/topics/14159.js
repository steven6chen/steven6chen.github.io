Surgical resection remains the only potentially curative therapy for patients with localized non&ndash;small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Due to the shared risk factor from tobacco smoking for both lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), however, the clinician is often faced with contemplating surgical resection in patients with impaired pulmonary function and an increased risk for lung resection.</p><p>Ever since Graham and Singer's report in 1933 of the first successful pneumonectomy for the treatment of lung cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-evaluation-for-lung-resection/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], the search has been ongoing for the ideal preoperative test to identify those patients at greatest risk for postoperative complications. Based on the assumption that a level of pulmonary impairment exists beyond which the risk of surgical intervention is prohibitive, efforts have been wide-ranging to identify the best predictive tests and to define the threshold values necessary for minimizing surgical risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-evaluation-for-lung-resection/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>Suggested tests have included measurement of preoperative pulmonary function, calculation of predicted postoperative (postresectional) pulmonary function, measures of gas exchange, and exercise testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-evaluation-for-lung-resection/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The utility of each of these tests and a recommended approach will be presented here.</p><p>General concepts regarding preoperative pulmonary assessment and factors that estimate the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications are discussed separately.

Subsequent studies have confirmed the value of spirometry and DLCO in providing an accurate assessment of operative risk for lung resection via thoracotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-evaluation-for-lung-resection/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, the predictive value of FEV<sub>1</sub> and DLCO for pulmonary complications is less clear when lobectomy is performed via thoracoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-evaluation-for-lung-resection/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p>Maximal voluntary ventilation (MVV) represents an integrated test that takes into account both airflow and muscle strength. However, its strong dependence on patient effort has led to its removal from most standard pulmonary function testing, and it is now rarely used for preoperative evaluation. However, when requested by the clinician, it may be valuable. In a study of patients undergoing lung resection <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> thoracoplasty for pulmonary tuberculosis, patients with MVV (measured as the maximal amount a patient can inhale and exhale over 12 seconds) less than 50 percent and a forced vital capacity (FVC) less than 70 percent of predicted had a 40 percent mortality following surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-evaluation-for-lung-resection/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Other studies have validated that a reduced preoperative MVV is associated with an increased risk of operative complications, and a threshold value of 50 percent of predicted is generally used to predict increased risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-evaluation-for-lung-resection/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h3\">Spirometry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The FEV<sub>1</sub> has become the primary spirometric value used for preoperative assessment. The FEV<sub>1</sub> correlates well with the degree of respiratory impairment in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and it provides an indirect measure of pulmonary reserve. In studies evaluating a variety of preoperative spirometric values, a reduced preoperative FEV<sub>1</sub> (&lt;60 percent predicted) was the strongest predictor of postoperative complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-evaluation-for-lung-resection/abstract/14-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-pulmonary-function-testing-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of pulmonary function testing in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Diffusing capacity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The usefulness of the DLCO in predicting postoperative complications following pulmonary resection has also been evaluated. Retrospective studies have reported that actual DLCO (as a percent of the predicted value) and predicted postoperative DLCO are the most important predictors of mortality and postoperative complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-evaluation-for-lung-resection/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>].</p><p>The ACCP does not make recommendations for cut-off values for spirometry or diffusion below which surgical resection should not be performed. Their focus is on calculating the predicted postoperative values to facilitate the decision for surgical resection. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Predicted postoperative pulmonary function'</a> below.)</p><p>The BTS suggests that patients with a preoperative FEV<sub>1</sub> in excess of 2 L (or &gt;80 percent predicted) generally tolerate pneumonectomy, whereas those with a preoperative FEV<sub>1</sub> greater than 1.5 L tolerate lobectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-evaluation-for-lung-resection/abstract/4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6</a>]. However, it has been difficult to identify a single absolute value of preoperative FEV<sub>1</sub> below which the risk of surgical intervention should be considered prohibitive for all patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-evaluation-for-lung-resection/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Responsible factors for this lack of a single value include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Differences in the amount of lung tissue to be resected, as the extent of the planned resection will affect the choice of an acceptable preoperative FEV<sub>1</sub>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Differences in the severity of underlying lung disease and the contribution to total lung function of the portion of lung to be resected.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Differences in size, age, gender, and race of patients undergoing lung resection.</p><p/><p>In addition, most studies used for the BTS guidelines were published prior to 1990. Supportive care and perioperative management have improved substantially since that time. Thus, strict use of these numbers could result in an overly restrictive approach to surgical therapy. As an example, a retrospective analysis of 150 patients treated at a single center between 2001 and 2003 found that a cutoff preoperative FEV<sub>1</sub> value of 47 percent resulted in the greatest diagnostic accuracy in predicting ability to survive pulmonary resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-evaluation-for-lung-resection/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The authors suggested that a lower threshold of predicted FEV<sub>1</sub> (45 to 50 percent predicted) could be accepted without increased mortality.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Predicted postoperative pulmonary function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who do not clearly fall into a low risk category based upon the preoperative FEV<sub>1</sub> and DLCO each being &gt;80 percent predicted should undergo further testing to allow calculation of predicted postoperative lung function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-evaluation-for-lung-resection/abstract/7,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,25</a>]. Predicted postoperative values for FEV<sub>1</sub> and DLCO should take into account the preoperative values, the amount of lung tissue to be resected, and its contribution to overall function (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-predicted-postoperative-fev1-following-lung-resection-surgery-anatomic-method-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-predicted-postoperative-fev1-following-lung-resection-surgery-perfusion-method\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a>).</p><p>In one study that has been heavily cited, a predicted postpneumonectomy FEV<sub>1</sub> greater than 0.8 L was chosen as the threshold value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-evaluation-for-lung-resection/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Prediction of postoperative pulmonary function was based upon a combination of spirometry and quantitative perfusion lung scanning to estimate the degree of functional loss following surgery. Because it may be difficult to predict before the time of surgery whether the patient will need a pneumonectomy, the authors used the calculated function in the entire noncancerous lung (ie, the lung that would remain if a pneumonectomy needed to be performed) as a criterion for surgical candidacy.</p><p>Radionuclide perfusion lung scanning can help predict postoperative lung function following resection, taking into account preoperative spirometry and the fractional predicted loss of lung function demonstrated by preoperative scanning. In one study, the correlation between predicted postoperative lung function and observed postoperative lung function was particularly good (and stable over time) following pneumonectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-evaluation-for-lung-resection/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. However, following lobectomy, there was a disproportionate early loss in observed function (compared to the predicted loss), followed by significant functional improvement over time.</p><p>Numerical cutoffs for predicted postoperative lung function have also been based upon the percentage of predicted value rather than the absolute level of predicted postoperative FEV<sub>1</sub> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-evaluation-for-lung-resection/abstract/5,6,25,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,25,28</a>]. Predicted postoperative function is calculated using preoperative values of FEV<sub>1</sub> or DLCO and measurement of lobar or whole lung fractional contribution to function as determined by quantitative perfusion lung scanning, ventilation, or computed tomography (CT) lung scanning. Alternatively, the estimated postoperative (ePO) FEV<sub>1</sub> is calculated by the formula: ePO FEV<sub>1</sub> = preop FEV<sub>1</sub> x (number of segments remaining <span class=\"nowrap\">postoperatively/total</span> number of lung segments [normally 18]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-evaluation-for-lung-resection/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The value obtained is then compared to the predicted value for FEV<sub>1</sub> for that individual&rsquo;s height, age, and gender to obtain the percent predicted postoperative FEV<sub>1</sub>. In one study, a predicted postoperative FEV<sub>1</sub> that was 40 percent or more of the predicted normal value for that patient was associated with no postoperative mortality (in 47 patients), whereas a value less than 40 percent was associated with 50 percent mortality (in six patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-evaluation-for-lung-resection/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. A subsequent study confirmed the correlation of predicted postoperative value of FEV<sub>1</sub> with the likelihood of postoperative complications in patients undergoing lung resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-evaluation-for-lung-resection/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The odds ratio for complications was 1.46 for each 0.2 L decrease in predicted postoperative FEV<sub>1</sub>.</p><p>Other reports have investigated the value of the predicted postoperative DLCO based upon the preoperative value and an assessment of regional lung function by quantitative perfusion scanning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-evaluation-for-lung-resection/abstract/28,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,31</a>]. In one such study, high morbidity and mortality were associated with a predicted postoperative DLCO below 40 percent of the predicted normal value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-evaluation-for-lung-resection/abstract/5,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,28</a>].</p><p>Guidelines from the ACCP suggest radionuclide perfusion lung scanning (the &ldquo;perfusion method&rdquo;) to calculate predicted postoperative FEV<sub>1</sub> in a patient undergoing pneumonectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-evaluation-for-lung-resection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In this method, the formula for calculating predicted postoperative FEV<sub>1</sub> (PPO FEV<sub>1</sub>) is as follows (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-predicted-postoperative-fev1-following-lung-resection-surgery-perfusion-method\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a>):</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p>PPO FEV<sub>1</sub> = preoperative FEV<sub>1</sub> x (1 &ndash; fraction of total perfusion in the resected lung)</p></div></div><p>where perfusion is measured with a quantitative radionuclide perfusion scan.</p><p>In a patient undergoing lobectomy, the &quot;anatomic method&quot; is used to calculate PPO FEV<sub>1</sub> according to the following formula (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-predicted-postoperative-fev1-following-lung-resection-surgery-anatomic-method-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>):</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p>PPO FEV<sub>1</sub> = preoperative FEV<sub>1</sub> x (1 &ndash; <span class=\"nowrap\">y/z)</span></p></div></div><p>where y = number of functional or unobstructed lung segments to be removed, and z = total number of functional segments (typically 19). Analogous formulas can also be used for calculating predicted postoperative DLCO (PPO DLCO).</p><p>Based on the low risk of death and cardiopulmonary complications when both PPO FEV<sub>1</sub> and PPO DLCO are &gt;60 percent, no further testing is necessary and the patient is deemed to have sufficient pulmonary function to undergo resectional surgery.

However, arterial blood gases have not proved to be as useful as measurement of FEV<sub>1</sub> and diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) in assessing suitability for lung resection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Arterial PO2</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Baseline (resting) arterial PO<sub>2</sub> is probably not an important predictor of postoperative complications or mortality following pulmonary resection.

However, this hypothesis has never been proven, and a 1994 study showed no difference in postoperative complications between patients with a preoperative PCO<sub>2</sub> less than 45 mmHg and those with a preoperative PCO<sub>2</sub> of 45 mmHg or higher (17 versus 13 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-evaluation-for-lung-resection/abstract/30,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,35</a>]. Thus, hypercapnia per se is not a contraindication to surgery, although surgery is frequently precluded in hypercapnic patients because of a low predicted postoperative FEV<sub>1</sub> or poor exercise performance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-evaluation-for-lung-resection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">EXERCISE TESTING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The role of preoperative exercise testing in the evaluation of patients prior to thoracotomy has evolved significantly over the past few decades [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-evaluation-for-lung-resection/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. As a comprehensive physiologic evaluation, a patient's performance on exercise testing is dependent upon the interactions among pulmonary function, cardiovascular function, and oxygen utilization by peripheral tissues. Exercise testing can take many forms, ranging from stair climbing to complete cardiopulmonary exercise testing with measurement of anaerobic threshold, oxygen consumption, and the level of work achieved. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-physiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exercise physiology&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=functional-exercise-testing-ventilatory-gas-analysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Functional exercise testing: Ventilatory gas analysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For patients with either postoperative predictive (PPO) forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) or PPO diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) &lt;60 percent predicted, but both &gt;30 percent predicted, a low technology exercise test (either stair climb or a shuttle walk test) should be performed. If either PPO FEV<sub>1</sub> or PPO DLCO is &lt;30 percent, a formal cardiopulmonary exercise test can be performed with measurement of maximal oxygen consumption.

A cutoff value below 60 percent predicted was thought to be prohibitive for resections involving more than one lobe, whereas a value above 75 percent predicted suggested a good outcome, regardless of the extent of resection.

In contrast, patients with VO<sub>2</sub> max &gt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per minute are considered to be suitable for any type of lung resection, including pneumonectomy. Patients with VO<sub>2</sub> max between 10 and 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per min have increased risk for mortality, and other factors, including PPO FEV<sub>1</sub>, PPO DLCO, and comorbidities, should also be taken into account in decision-making for these patients.</p><p>The <span class=\"nowrap\">ERS/ESTS</span> guidelines suggest that, for patients with intermediate VO<sub>2</sub> max values (between 10 and 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per min) and postoperative predicted FEV<sub>1</sub> and DLCO values &ge;30 percent, resection up to the calculated extent is acceptable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-evaluation-for-lung-resection/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].
