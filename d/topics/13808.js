In the United States, the most important members of this family are those of the genus <em>Toxicodendron</em> (previously classified as in the genus <em>Rhus</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poison-ivy-toxicodendron-dermatitis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]), which include common or northern poison ivy (<em>Toxicodendron radicans</em>), western poison ivy (<em>Toxicodendron rydbergii</em>), eastern poison oak (<em>Toxicodendron toxicarium</em>), western poison oak (<em>Toxicodendron diversilobum</em>), and poison sumac (<em>Toxicodendron vernix</em>). Toxicodendron means &quot;poisonous tree,&quot; an appropriate choice for these dermatitis-provoking species. In contrast, although they often have three-leaflet configurations similar to those of <em>Toxicodendron</em>, members of the genus <em>Rhus</em> are nonallergenic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poison-ivy-toxicodendron-dermatitis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Throughout this topic review, we refer to <em>Toxicodendron</em> dermatitis by the common name &quot;poison ivy dermatitis.&quot;</p><p>This topic reviews the epidemiology, prevention, and treatment of allergic contact dermatitis due to these <em>Toxicodendron</em> species. The evaluation and management of contact dermatitis from other causes is discussed separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-dermatitis-eczema#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of dermatitis (eczema)&quot;, section on 'Contact dermatitis'</a>). Despite the prevalence of poison ivy dermatitis in the United States, there are very few well-designed, published studies examining the management of this condition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many people are sensitized to urushiol, the allergenic compound found in poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac. Fifty percent of people will react to poison ivy in nature, and approximately 75 percent will react to patch testing with urushiol. Annually, an estimated 25 to 40 million Americans require medical treatment after exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poison-ivy-toxicodendron-dermatitis/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Firefighters, forestry workers, and farmers constitute a large proportion of the victims affected through occupational exposure, and this can have important occupational and economic impacts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poison-ivy-toxicodendron-dermatitis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>Poison ivy dermatitis affects all ethnicities and skin types, and most geographical regions in the United States are at risk&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poison-ivy-toxicodendron-dermatitis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Geography'</a> below). Children are also affected; most children over the age of eight years are sensitized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poison-ivy-toxicodendron-dermatitis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Allergic responsiveness to poison ivy appears to wane with age, especially in those with mild reactions and limited sensitizing exposures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">IDENTIFYING THE PLANT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While the common phrase &quot;leaves of three, let them be&quot; is a helpful reminder to avoid poison ivy and related plants, members of the <em>Toxicodendron</em> genus have varied presentations based on the season, growth cycle, region, and climate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F72155\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72155 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F81173%7EDERM%2F54814%7EDERM%2F81397\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81173 graphicRef54814 graphicRef81397 \">picture 1A-C</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poison-ivy-toxicodendron-dermatitis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Poison ivy and poison oak are often identified by three leaflets with flowering branches arising from axillary positions on a single stem. Poison sumac more often forms leaflets of five, seven, or more that angle upward toward the top of the stem. One may also find characteristic black dots on <em>Toxicodendron</em> species; this black lacquer is oxidized urushiol (due to the enzyme laccase found in the oleoresin) and can be found on plant leaves within 10 minutes of its exposure to oxygen. <em>Toxicodendron</em> species also produce a green or off-white fruit in the autumn months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poison-ivy-toxicodendron-dermatitis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Two species of <em>Rhus</em> possess trifoliate leaves; however, the fruiting structures are red and terminal, not off-white and axillary (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F72155\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72155 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">GEOGRAPHY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Toxicodendron</em> species are ubiquitous in many environments, particularly in the United States, and can be found in various forms or as cross-reacting allergenic plants throughout the world. Northern poison ivy is more common east of the Rocky Mountains, often growing as climbing vines. Poison ivy in and west of the Rocky Mountains is found as a low-growing shrub. Poison oak is found primarily west of the Rocky Mountains, and poison sumac is found in boggy, uninhabited areas of the southeastern part of the US. It is less common to find <em>Toxicodendron</em> species above 4000 feet of elevation or in arid, desert climates (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F79030%7EPC%2F70356%7EPC%2F60686\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79030 graphicRef70356 graphicRef60686 \">figure 2A-C</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poison-ivy-toxicodendron-dermatitis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CROSS-REACTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other members of Anacardiaceae and related families contain allergenic catechols or noncatechol phenols that cross react with components of urushiol found in <em>Toxicodendron</em> species. Mango rind, cashew nutshell, Japanese lacquer tree, Indian marking nut tree (used for laundry marking in India), Brazilian pepper tree, and ginkgo tree can all cause dermatitis in sensitized individuals.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urushiol is the allergenic substance in poison ivy and related plants. It is a mixture of compounds that makes up 60 percent of the plant oleoresin. Those compounds with zero, one, two, or three double bonds are allergenic; the diolefin (two double bonds) is the most allergenic. The oleoresin also contains the enzyme laccase, gum, water, and water-insoluble glycoproteins. It is a light, colorless oil present in the fruit, leaves, stem, and root of the plant. Exposure to bruised or broken plant parts allows the toxic oil to contact skin, fingernails, clothing, pets, tools, or other objects. Intact plant parts generally do not cause dermatitis. However, plants are easily damaged by rubbing, rain, or dry fall weather.</p><p>Poison ivy dermatitis is a classic type IV hypersensitivity (cell-mediated) allergic reaction. The allergens are low-molecular-weight haptens that easily and quickly penetrate the epidermis, where they are taken up and processed by Langerhans cells. These antigen-presenting cells then travel to regional lymph nodes where effector T lymphocytes are activated, expand, and circulate throughout the body. Because urushiol is a powerful antigen, a single exposure can be adequate to cause clinical symptoms. Once clonally expanded T lymphocytes exist, reexposure to poison ivy causes cytokine release and clinical symptoms in 12 to 48 hours. Patients with a history of poison ivy dermatitis may be at increased risk for dermatitis from cross-reaction with other urushiol-containing plants such as mangoes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poison-ivy-toxicodendron-dermatitis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intense pruritus and erythema are the most common presenting signs of poison ivy dermatitis. Patients then develop papules or plaques, vesicles, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bullae, often arranged in characteristic linear or streak-like configurations where a portion of a plant has made contact with the skin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F69330\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69330 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p>Involvement of the face and genitals may cause significant edema. Clinical presentations vary with patient activity. One report found that children in New Zealand were more likely to present with facial dermatitis reflective of play under <em>Toxicodendron succedaneum</em> trees, while adults more frequently presented with upper limb symptoms acquired while gardening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poison-ivy-toxicodendron-dermatitis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Urushiol contact has also caused urticaria and erythema multiforme [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poison-ivy-toxicodendron-dermatitis/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. &quot;Black spot&quot; poison ivy dermatitis occurs when urushiol is left on the skin and oxidizes, appearing as black spots that cannot be washed off (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F69330\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69330 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poison-ivy-toxicodendron-dermatitis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The concentrated resin creates both an irritant dermatitis and an allergic dermatitis.</p><p>Symptoms of poison ivy dermatitis in sensitized individuals generally develop within 4 to 96 hours after exposure and peak between 1 and 14 days after exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poison-ivy-toxicodendron-dermatitis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. New lesions can present up to 21 days after exposure in previously unexposed individuals. Lesions present in different locations at different times after exposure based upon the amount of urushiol present and the stratum corneum thickness of the involved areas. This can give the impression that the poison ivy is spreading from one region to another. Blister fluid is not antigenic, however.</p><p>Occasionally, after the initial exposure, patients continue to come in contact with the dried, black antigenic resin on contaminated clothing, pet fur or claws, gardening tools, or in crevices under the fingernails. This perpetuates the patient's dermatitis and puts their contacts at risk for developing an allergic reaction. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Avoidance'</a> below.)</p><p>Left untreated, the dermatitis usually resolves in one to three weeks. The most common complication of poison ivy dermatitis is secondary bacterial infection of the skin with <em>Staphylococcus</em> <em>aureus</em> or beta-hemolytic group A <em>Streptococcus</em>. Bacterial flora does vary somewhat by site and can be polymicrobial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poison-ivy-toxicodendron-dermatitis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Postinflammatory hyperpigmentation is more common in darker skin types and, while it can persist for several months, usually resolves without treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poison-ivy-toxicodendron-dermatitis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Renal and genitourinary complications are rare, although urinary retention due to penile edema and nephrosis from immune complex deposition in the kidney have both been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poison-ivy-toxicodendron-dermatitis/abstract/6,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of poison ivy dermatitis is typically made based on a history of exposure and a characteristic pattern of a well-demarcated contact dermatitis in areas of skin that could have come in contact with plant parts, particularly when linear streaks are present (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F69330\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69330 \">picture 2</a>). Atypical presentations may occur when patients are exposed secondarily, such as when a pet gets urushiol on its fur and then brushes against the patient. It is impossible to diagnose poison ivy as the cause of a rash based solely on the appearance of the rash.</p><p>The differential diagnosis of poison ivy dermatitis includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A different plant-induced allergic contact dermatitis &ndash; Plants other than <em>Toxicodendron</em> can cause dermatitis.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-dermatitis-eczema#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of dermatitis (eczema)&quot;, section on 'Allergic contact dermatitis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Irritant contact dermatitis &ndash; Many substances can produce a nonallergic inflammatory skin reaction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F71834\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71834 \">picture 3</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-dermatitis-eczema#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of dermatitis (eczema)&quot;, section on 'Irritant contact dermatitis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nummular dermatitis &ndash; Nummular dermatitis consists of intensely pruritic, eczematous plaques. Scale, crusting, or serous drainage may be evident. Patients can present with as few as one lesion or as many as 20 to 50 lesions. Lesions tend to be circular and usually measure between 2 and 10 cm in diameter. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-dermatitis-eczema#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of dermatitis (eczema)&quot;, section on 'Nummular eczema'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Phytophotodermatitis &ndash; Phytophotodermatitis is a phototoxic reaction with erythema with or without blistering in response to ultraviolet exposure in patients exposed to photosensitizing plant compounds. Unlike poison ivy dermatitis, lesions will only be seen on sun-exposed skin. Lesions often resolve with significant hyperpigmentation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=photosensitivity-disorders-photodermatoses-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Photosensitivity disorders (photodermatoses): Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment&quot;, section on 'Phytophotodermatitis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arthropod reactions &ndash; The pruritic burrows of scabies may be mistaken for poison ivy dermatitis, but do not generally appear as vesicles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F51161\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51161 \">picture 4</a>) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=scabies-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Scabies: Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>). Bedbug bites can be linear and pruritic and may occasionally present as vesicles or bullae. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bedbugs\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bedbugs&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Avoidance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most important and effective treatment for poison ivy dermatitis is identification and avoidance of toxic plants and related allergens. Sap-containing plant parts are allergenic and irritant year round and cannot be safely handled during winter months. Allergenicity can also persist years after the plant dies.</p><p>Protective clothing is useful, but patients should be reminded that clothing, pets, and fingernails can harbor the allergenic resin for many days. The oleoresin can seep through clothing and can penetrate rubber or latex gloves, but not heavy-duty vinyl gloves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poison-ivy-toxicodendron-dermatitis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Burning poison ivy is not a safe way to dispose of the vegetation. Urushiol is stable at high temperatures, and the plant particles dispersed in the smoke are allergenic and irritant.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Washing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After a known exposure, patients should remove any contaminated clothing and gently wash the skin with mild soap and water as soon as possible. One study found that after approximately 10 minutes on the skin, 50 percent of the urushiol can be removed; this number falls to 10 percent after 30 minutes and zero after one hour [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poison-ivy-toxicodendron-dermatitis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Despite this, washing even two hours after exposure significantly reduces the likelihood and severity of dermatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poison-ivy-toxicodendron-dermatitis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Fingernails should be washed carefully to remove resin that may remain under the nails.</p><p>Vigorous scrubbing is not useful and can exacerbate impending dermatitis. Washing the skin after dermatitis has become clinically apparent is futile. A study that compared a chemical inactivator intended to prevent poison ivy, an oil-removing compound, and a dishwashing soap found that all three preparations significantly reduced dermatitis when used two hours after experimental exposure to poison ivy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poison-ivy-toxicodendron-dermatitis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Although the authors concluded that there was no significant difference in the effectiveness of the three preparations, the point estimate of effectiveness was higher with Tecnu than with the other two preparations, and the study was inadequately powered to detect differences that patients would likely consider clinically important. Tecnu is significantly more expensive than the other preparations, and it is reasonable to recommend to patients that they wash with an inexpensive mild detergent.</p><p>Clothing, tools, or other items that may have come in contact with the oleoresin also should be washed with warm, soapy water prior to reuse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Barrier creams</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of barrier creams to prevent contact dermatitis is controversial. Barrier creams are topical preparations that are applied prior to exposure to a contact allergen in an attempt to prevent the development of dermatitis. Organoclay compounds appear to be more effective barriers than other preparations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poison-ivy-toxicodendron-dermatitis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>The barrier cream that has the best evidence for efficacy for the prevention of poison ivy dermatitis is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bentoquatam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bentoquatam</a> (5% quaternium-18 bentonite lotion), an organoclay compound. The efficacy of bentoquatam is supported by a controlled trial in 211 subjects. Among the 144 subjects who showed a reaction to urushiol, only 32 percent developed dermatitis at the site treated with bentoquatam [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poison-ivy-toxicodendron-dermatitis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In addition, reactions that occurred at bentoquatam-treated sites were less severe than those at untreated sites.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bentoquatam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Bentoquatam</a> must be reapplied every four hours and leaves a clay residue on the skin.</p><p>Other preparations that may be effective include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poison-ivy-toxicodendron-dermatitis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Linoleic acid dimers. These do not prevent urushiol penetration of the skin and thus must be rinsed off and reapplied after four to eight hours.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Occlusive barrier ointments.</p><p/><p>Other topical barrier creams may emerge as research continues for preparations effective in preventing dermatitis from chemical warfare agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poison-ivy-toxicodendron-dermatitis/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Desensitization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reports of Native Americans achieving hyposensitivity to poison ivy dermatitis by chewing the leaves, the lower prevalence of mango dermatitis in indigenous Hawaiians compared with immigrants, and decreased poison ivy sensitivity of cashew nut shell oil processing in factory workers have all prompted research into commercially available hyposensitization kits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poison-ivy-toxicodendron-dermatitis/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>].</p><p>These programs have generally not been effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poison-ivy-toxicodendron-dermatitis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]; require months of low-dose antigen ingestion accompanied by side effects like pruritus ani, urticaria, and dermatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poison-ivy-toxicodendron-dermatitis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]; and are neither practical nor recommended.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Other</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pretreatment with oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentoxifylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pentoxifylline</a>, a methylxanthine tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-inhibitor, has been shown to diminish patch-test reactivity to nickel and other forms of allergic contact dermatitis, but not to urushiol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poison-ivy-toxicodendron-dermatitis/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Few controlled trials of poison ivy dermatitis treatment have been performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poison-ivy-toxicodendron-dermatitis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

Topical astringents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aluminum-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aluminum acetate</a> (Burow's solution) or aluminum sulfate <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium acetate</a> used under occlusion may be useful to dry weeping lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poison-ivy-toxicodendron-dermatitis/abstract/3,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,24</a>]. A soap mixture of ethoxylate and sodium lauroyl sarcosinate surfactants may also be of benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poison-ivy-toxicodendron-dermatitis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Topical antihistamines, anesthetics containing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benzocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">benzocaine</a>, and antibiotics containing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">neomycin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bacitracin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bacitracin</a> should be avoided because of their own allergenic potential.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pimecrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Pimecrolimus</a>, a topical calcineurin inhibitor, is ineffective for the treatment of <em>Toxicodendron</em>-induced allergic contact dermatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poison-ivy-toxicodendron-dermatitis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Antihistamines</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although there is little to no evidence to support their use, sedating and nonsedating oral antihistamines are commonly used to try to reduce pruritus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poison-ivy-toxicodendron-dermatitis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. However, the itching in poison ivy dermatitis is not caused by histamine release.&nbsp;Relief that patients derive from oral antihistamines is primarily due to the sedating effects of certain antihistamines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poison-ivy-toxicodendron-dermatitis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. We do not use nonsedating antihistamines at all in the management of poison ivy dermatitis, but we find sedating antihistamines occasionally beneficial for those who have difficulty sleeping due to pruritus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pruritus-overview-of-management#H8354417\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pruritus: Overview of management&quot;, section on 'Antihistamines'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Topical corticosteroids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High-potency topical corticosteroids (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62402\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62402 \">table 1</a>) are most helpful early in allergic contact dermatitis. Once vesicles are established, they do little to alter the natural course of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poison-ivy-toxicodendron-dermatitis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>], but many clinicians believe they are helpful in relieving symptoms. Clinical experience suggests that low-potency topical corticosteroids are of little use. High-potency topical corticosteroids should generally not be used on thin skin such as the face, genitals, or intertriginous areas, due to the potential for these agents to cause skin atrophy and other adverse effects. However, the only topical corticosteroids that can influence the course of poison ivy dermatitis are superpotent ones such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clobetasol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clobetasol</a> propionate 0.05% cream. Use of superpotent corticosteroids, even under occlusion, for up to a week on severely involved areas poses little threat for permanent atrophy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-dermatologic-therapy-and-topical-corticosteroid-use\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of dermatologic therapy and topical corticosteroid use&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Systemic corticosteroids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with severe dermatitis, particularly involving the face or genital region, may require systemic corticosteroids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poison-ivy-toxicodendron-dermatitis/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. There are no well-designed studies examining the proper dose and course of systemic corticosteroids for poison ivy dermatitis; however, extensive clinical experience suggests that rebound dermatitis occurs commonly if too short a course is used (such as the six-day course in a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> dose pack) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poison-ivy-toxicodendron-dermatitis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. As in other forms of allergic contact dermatitis, circulating T lymphocytes directed toward urushiol are able to expand and activate cytokines for a significant period after exposure to antigen, leading to rebound dermatitis when corticosteroids are stopped.</p><p>Oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> started at a dose of approximately 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> (maximum initial dose 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> can be dramatically beneficial for the miserable patient. The dose can then be tapered over two or three weeks (for instance, 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> the first week, 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> the second week, 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> the third week would be one possible taper for a 21-day course). There are no published studies comparing 14- and 21-day courses of prednisone in poison ivy. We typically treat adults with a 21-day total course, however. In clinical practice, however, 14-day courses only rarely result in rebound dermatitis and may be appropriate if there are concerns about steroid toxicity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of systemic glucocorticoids&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although oral administration of corticosteroids offers flexibility in daily dosing, intramuscular injection of corticosteroids is a treatment option for patients who cannot tolerate or comply with administration of oral corticosteroids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poison-ivy-toxicodendron-dermatitis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In our clinical experience, we have found treatment with a mixture of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a> acetonide (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg),</span> a long-acting corticosteroid, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=betamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">betamethasone</a> (0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg),</span> a short- to intermediate-acting corticosteroid, beneficial.

In the United States, the most important members of this family are those of the genus <em>Toxicodendron</em>, which include poison ivy, poison oak, and poison sumac. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While the common phrase &quot;leaves of three, let them be&quot; is a helpful reminder to avoid poison ivy and related plants, members of the <em>Toxicodendron</em> genus have varied presentations based on the season, growth cycle, region, and climate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F72155\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72155 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F81173%7EDERM%2F54814%7EDERM%2F81397\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81173 graphicRef54814 graphicRef81397 \">picture 1A-C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Identifying the plant'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urushiol is the allergenic substance in <em>Toxicodendron</em>. Exposure to urushiol can occur through contact with parts of the plant (eg, roots, sap, leaves, or stems) or via contact with objects that have been contaminated by the plant oleoresin. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intense pruritus and erythema are the most common presenting signs of poison ivy dermatitis. Patients then develop papules, vesicles, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bullae, often arranged in characteristic linear or streak-like configurations where a portion of a plant has made contact with the skin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F69330\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69330 \">picture 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of poison ivy dermatitis is typically made based on a history of exposure and a characteristic pattern of a well-demarcated contact dermatitis in areas of skin that could have come in contact with plant parts, particularly when linear streaks are present. Atypical presentations may occur when patients are exposed secondarily, such as when a pet gets urushiol on its fur and then brushes against the patient. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Poison ivy dermatitis is best prevented by avoiding exposure through the use of protective clothing such as heavy-duty vinyl gloves. Washing with a detergent soap (or with special preparations designed for poison ivy) as soon as possible after exposure can reduce the risk of dermatitis, but washing even two hours after exposure can be beneficial (see <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Washing'</a> above). Pretreatment of exposed skin with topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bentoquatam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bentoquatam</a> is of some benefit in people who are at high risk for exposure to poison ivy. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment for dermatitis can include topical symptomatic therapies such as oatmeal baths and cool compresses (see <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Topical symptomatic therapy'</a> above). High-potency topical corticosteroids (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62402\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62402 \">table 1</a>) do little to alter the natural course of poison ivy dermatitis once vesicles have developed, but they may reduce itching, particularly if used under occlusion. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Topical corticosteroids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic corticosteroids, such as a course of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> tapered over 14 or 21 days, can be dramatically effective in reducing symptoms and are the treatment of choice for extensive poison ivy dermatitis and for significant dermatitis affecting the face or genital region. We typically use a 21-day course to minimize the risk of rebound dermatitis, but a 14-day course may be appropriate when there are concerns about steroid toxicity. Short courses of systemic corticosteroids (eg, a six-day <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> dose pack) can result in rebound dermatitis and should be avoided.
