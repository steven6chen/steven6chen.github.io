The causes, evaluation, and treatment of pituitary incidentaloma are discussed here. The causes, clinical presentation, and evaluation of sellar masses are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-presentation-and-evaluation-of-sellar-masses\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes, presentation, and evaluation of sellar masses&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term &quot;pituitary incidentaloma&quot; refers to a previously unsuspected lesion that is detected on an imaging study performed for reasons other than pituitary symptoms or disease. Among adults undergoing imaging studies (computed tomography [CT] or magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) for reasons other than pituitary symptoms or disease, the frequency of incidentally discovered signal abnormalities (&lt;10 mm) varies among studies from 4 to 20 percent by CT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incidentally-discovered-sellar-masses-pituitary-incidentalomas/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>] and 10 to 38 percent by MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incidentally-discovered-sellar-masses-pituitary-incidentalomas/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>Not all incidentally discovered sellar masses are pituitary adenomas. In one study of 61 incidentally discovered sellar masses found among 1000 unselected autopsy specimens, there were 37 Rathke's cleft cysts, 18 pituitary adenomas, and two each of hyperplasia, infarction, and hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incidentally-discovered-sellar-masses-pituitary-incidentalomas/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, pituitary adenomas are a common finding, as illustrated by a review of 29 autopsy studies that included over 18,000 pituitary glands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incidentally-discovered-sellar-masses-pituitary-incidentalomas/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The frequency of pituitary adenomas was approximately 10 percent, and nearly all of the adenomas were microadenomas (&lt;10 mm). The frequencies were similar for men and women and across age groups in adults.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CHARACTERISTICS OF REFERRED PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who are referred for evaluation of incidentally discovered magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) signal abnormalities within the sella tend to have larger lesions and a higher incidence of neurologic abnormalities than would be expected from autopsy and MRI series of unselected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incidentally-discovered-sellar-masses-pituitary-incidentalomas/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. This presumably reflects the selection process of a referral population. In one series of 328 referred patients, 233 had lesions 10 mm or larger [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incidentally-discovered-sellar-masses-pituitary-incidentalomas/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Of the 328, 179 were diagnosed as nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas, 47 as Rathke's cleft cysts, 37 as lactotroph adenomas, 16 as somatotroph adenomas, and seven as corticotroph adenomas. Over half had one or more hormonal deficiencies. In the largest reported series of incidentally discovered sellar masses, 506 patients were reported from referral centers, in response to a questionnaire, to have incidentally discovered sellar masses; the majority were &gt;10 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incidentally-discovered-sellar-masses-pituitary-incidentalomas/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>The overall frequency of different types of pituitary adenomas is not known, because many large series of incidentally discovered sellar masses intentionally exclude those patients who have lesions that are hypersecreting. In our experience, however, it is common for a sellar mass that is discovered incidentally to be associated, on further evaluation, with obvious clinical consequences, including visual impairment and hormonal hypersecretion. Some of these patients even have obvious clinical manifestations of the hypersecretion (eg, acromegaly) that had been overlooked until the mass was discovered. Severe hormonal hyposecretion, including marked hypothyroidism and hypoadrenalism can also be seen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">NATURAL HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Little information is available about the natural history of incidentally discovered sellar masses. In the largest series of 506 patients described above, 258 underwent surgery soon after discovery of the mass, and 248 were followed for a mean of 26.9 months (range 6 to 173 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incidentally-discovered-sellar-masses-pituitary-incidentalomas/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The size of the sellar mass increased, by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), in 30 (20 of the 123 with lesions originally &gt;10 mm, and 10 of the 57 with lesions originally &lt;10 mm). Among the latter, only three (all &ge;5 mm) increased to &gt;10 mm in 65 to 84 months of observation. In a report since that review, 2 of 16 with a mass &lt;10 mm increased in size in an average of 41 months of observation, neither to a clinically significant degree [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incidentally-discovered-sellar-masses-pituitary-incidentalomas/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>In a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies that included 865 patients with incidentally discovered, nonfunctioning sellar masses, those &ge;10 mm were approximately four times more likely to experience growth during follow-up than those &lt;10 mm (incidence 12.5 versus 3.3 per 100 person-years, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incidentally-discovered-sellar-masses-pituitary-incidentalomas/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION AND MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evaluation of a patient found incidentally to have a lesion within the pituitary depends upon the size of the lesion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F80461\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef80461 \">algorithm 1</a>). Lesions 10 mm or larger are more likely to be associated with visual and hormonal abnormalities at the time they are discovered and are more likely to enlarge during observation than smaller lesions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-gonadotroph-and-other-clinically-nonfunctioning-pituitary-adenomas\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of gonadotroph and other clinically nonfunctioning pituitary adenomas&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Lesions 10 mm or larger</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>These lesions should be evaluated as a symptomatic sellar mass of similar size. Vision should be evaluated clinically and by formal testing of acuity and fields. We suggest that these patients undergo clinical and biochemical evaluation for both hormone hypersecretion and hypopituitarism. For hypersecretion, this includes serum prolactin, insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incidentally-discovered-sellar-masses-pituitary-incidentalomas/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and alpha subunit, and 24-hour urine cortisol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incidentally-discovered-sellar-masses-pituitary-incidentalomas/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The evaluation of hypopituitarism is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-presentation-and-evaluation-of-sellar-masses#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes, presentation, and evaluation of sellar masses&quot;, section on 'Hormonal evaluation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-testing-for-hypopituitarism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic testing for hypopituitarism&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with pituitary adenomas resulting in hormonal hypersecretion (eg, hyperprolactinemia, acromegaly, or Cushing's disease) should be treated as other patients with these disorders.

The patient should be monitored for size of the mass, visual changes, and hormonal hypersecretion in 6 and 12 months, then annually for several years, and perhaps less frequently thereafter. Hormonal hyposecretion should be treated by appropriate replacement. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-gonadotroph-and-other-clinically-nonfunctioning-adenomas#H7585601\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of gonadotroph and other clinically nonfunctioning adenomas&quot;, section on 'Asymptomatic adenomas'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hypopituitarism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hypopituitarism&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Lesions less than 10 mm</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with smaller lesions should be evaluated clinically for hormonal hypersecretion and biochemically for any hypersecretion suspected clinically. Only serum prolactin should be measured if there is no clinical suspicion of hormonal hypersecretion, an approach that, in one report, was much more cost effective than either measurement of multiple hormones or performance of follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at 6 and 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incidentally-discovered-sellar-masses-pituitary-incidentalomas/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. No evaluation for hormonal hyposecretion or visual abnormalities is necessary. Our approach differs from the 2011 Endocrine Society Guidelines, which recommend that patients with an incidentaloma of any size undergo initial testing for hormonal hypersecretion and hypopituitarism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incidentally-discovered-sellar-masses-pituitary-incidentalomas/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Patients with lesions not associated with hormonal hypersecretion may be treated as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incidentally-discovered-sellar-masses-pituitary-incidentalomas/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with lesions 2 to 4 mm in diameter, we suggest no further testing, as additional tests do not appear to affect outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incidentally-discovered-sellar-masses-pituitary-incidentalomas/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with lesions 5 to 9 mm in diameter, we suggest monitoring with pituitary MRI yearly for two years; if the lesion is stable in this period, the frequency can be decreased to every few years and then even less often.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1560747628\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
