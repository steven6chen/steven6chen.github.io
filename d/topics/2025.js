A biocompatible membrane (BCM) has traditionally been defined as &quot;one that elicits the least amount of inflammatory response in patients exposed to it&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biochemical-mechanisms-involved-in-blood-hemodialysis-membrane-interactions/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. It has been suggested, however, that &quot;adsorption&quot; (ie, binding) of low-molecular-weight proteins or peptides on certain types of dialysis membranes represents an additional mechanism of clearance during dialysis and may also be important in defining the biocompatibility of the membrane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biochemical-mechanisms-involved-in-blood-hemodialysis-membrane-interactions/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>This topic will review the pathways activated during the interaction of blood with biomaterials and the contribution of adsorption to modifying the inflammatory response resulting from this interaction. The known interactions between blood and the new hemodialysis membranes will be emphasized, with only limited attention to the effect of reuse. Because hemodialysis is a repetitive procedure, minor reactions induced by the membrane at each treatment can eventually lead to adverse long-term clinical sequelae. The acute and chronic clinical sequelae of blood-membrane interactions are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reactions-to-the-hemodialysis-membrane\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reactions to the hemodialysis membrane&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-consequences-of-hemodialysis-membrane-biocompatibility\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical consequences of hemodialysis membrane biocompatibility&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the broadest sense, all aspects of the dialysis treatment affect biocompatibility. These include dialysate composition and temperature, the <span class=\"nowrap\">permeability/porosity</span> of the dialysis membrane, the type of clearance (diffuse or convective), the initial sterilant (eg, ethylene oxide), reuse procedure and sterilant (formaldehyde, hypochlorite, peroxyacetic <span class=\"nowrap\">acid/hydrogen</span> peroxide), and residual materials from the manufacturing process. However, it is the biocompatibility of the membrane itself that is most important and that has been most closely studied.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPOSITION OF DIALYSIS MEMBRANES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dialysis membranes can be classified into multiple groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biochemical-mechanisms-involved-in-blood-hemodialysis-membrane-interactions/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cellulose (cuprophane)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Substituted cellulose</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Synthetic</p><p/><p>Previously, cellulose membranes were the most commonly used membranes. According to the United States Renal Data Systems (USRDS) 1995 Annual Data Report, the distribution of dialyzer membranes used in the United States in 1990 and 1991 was 61 percent cellulose (cuprophane), 18 percent semi-synthetic (substituted cellulose, mostly triacetate and Hemophane), and 19 percent synthetic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biochemical-mechanisms-involved-in-blood-hemodialysis-membrane-interactions/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. By comparison, in the USRDS 2003 Annual Data Report, approximately 80 and 20 percent of units in 1997 were using synthetic and cellulose membranes, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biochemical-mechanisms-involved-in-blood-hemodialysis-membrane-interactions/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Substituted cellulose and synthetic membranes have become standard in most settings.</p><p>Cellulosic membranes are made up of a sequence of repetitive polysaccharide units containing hydroxyl groups, similar to bacterial cell walls. Cellulose acetate is a modification of this membrane in which 80 percent of the hydroxyl groups are replaced by acetate radicals. Another substituted cellulose, Hemophane, has diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) radicals substituting for 1 percent of the hydroxyl groups.</p><p>The synthetic membranes are further grouped as &quot;hydrophilic&quot; <span class=\"nowrap\">(polyether/polycarbonate)</span> or &quot;hydrophobic.&quot; The hydrophobic membranes are generally apolar, have a low energy of interaction with water, adsorb proteins, are more porous, and have high ultrafiltration coefficients. Hydrophobic membranes include polyacrylonitrile (PAN), <span class=\"nowrap\">PAN/AN69</span> membrane (copolymer of acrylonitrile and methallyl sulfonate), polysulfone (PS), polyethersulfone, and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) membranes.</p><p>The side group modifications on substituted cellulose membranes and the high adsorptive capacity of synthetic membranes generally lead to a decrease in the intensity of blood-membrane interactions. As an example, the PAN membrane can vigorously activate the complement system; however, it also has a high adsorptive capacity for complement, resulting in a low net level of complement activation products reaching the systemic circulation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H135131730\"><span class=\"h1\">PERMEABILITY OF THE DIALYSIS MEMBRANE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The <span class=\"nowrap\">permeability/porosity</span> of the dialysis membrane may affect its biocompatibility, although membrane flux is more a function of dialyzer pore size while biocompatibility is primarily a function of dialyzer membrane materials. High-flux dialyzers, which can be of varying degrees of biocompatibility, are generally defined by their ability to remove middle molecules, with beta-2 microglobulin being the prototype of such molecules. Membranes that are highly biocompatible can be high flux or low flux on the basis of membrane pore size and filtration characteristics. One major consequence of the increased pore size of high-flux dialyzers is the potential for backfiltration or backdiffusion from dialysate to blood, with movement of dialysis water impurities, such as endotoxin, into the blood stream during dialysis. To the extent that this backfiltration or backdiffusion creates a bio-incompatible treatment that may contribute to an inflammatory response, it may be considered to be one aspect of biocompatibility.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">BLOOD-MEMBRANE INTERACTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When blood encounters the hemodialysis membrane, several reactions are triggered, including the complement cascade, the coagulation cascade, and the contact-phase reaction. In addition to these protein-mediated pathways, cellular mechanisms can also be activated during hemodialysis due to direct contact of cells with the membrane and to byproducts of complement activation. These pathways are often interrelated, and the activation of one system leads to the participation of the other.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Complement activation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complement activation proceeds via the alternate pathway during hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biochemical-mechanisms-involved-in-blood-hemodialysis-membrane-interactions/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. New, unused cuprophane membranes activate complement to the greatest degree [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biochemical-mechanisms-involved-in-blood-hemodialysis-membrane-interactions/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The free hydroxyl group on the surface of the cuprophane membrane is thought to promote the deposition and covalent bonding of C3b and the association of C3b with factor B; this is followed by the activation of factor B by factor D, eventually resulting in formation of the C3 convertase C3bBb and the C5 convertase C(3b)nBb.</p><p>There are several sequelae of complement activation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Release of anaphylatoxins (C3a and C5a)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Formation of the membrane attack complex (C5b-9)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Activation of neutrophils and monocytes</p><p/><p>C3a and C5a are potent, biologically active agents capable of producing intense vascular smooth muscle contraction, increased vascular permeability, and the release of histamines from mast cells.</p><p>Substitution of as little as 1 percent of the hydroxyl ions by diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) residues (Hemophane) results in significant attenuation of complement activation. However, other membranes, such as polyacrylonitrile (PAN), appear to activate complement locally but do not contain hydroxyl moieties.</p><p>An alternate hypothesis for defining the complement activation potential of biomaterials has been proposed. Instead of defining an activating biomaterial as one that favors the deposition of C3b and the subsequent initiation of the positive feedback loop by C3bBb, this hypothesis emphasizes the important inhibitory role of factor H. Discrimination between activating and nonactivating biomaterials depends upon the relative capacity of the surface to bind factor B or factor H [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biochemical-mechanisms-involved-in-blood-hemodialysis-membrane-interactions/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A membrane that promotes preferential binding of factor H (leading to inactivation of C3b and termination of propagation of the complement cascade) and that does not favor the binding of factor B has a low capacity to activate complement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cellulose membranes, on the other hand, have low affinity for factor H, an abundance of hydroxyl radicals, and little or no capacity to absorb anaphylatoxin (C3a, C5a). They are therefore associated with the highest levels of complement activation.</p><p/><p>Activation of complement is maximum at 15 minutes and lasts up to 90 minutes after the initiation of hemodialysis with new cellulose-derived membranes. The rate of complement activation decreases as dialysis proceeds. The mechanisms for this decrease have not been well defined, but coating of the membrane with protein films is thought to be important. These films consist of fibrin, albumin, and C3 fragments, particularly C3b (covalently bound), C3c, and C3d (noncovalently bound).</p><p>For the same reasons, reused cellulose membranes have a reduced complement-activating capacity. It should be noted, however, that reuse techniques that employ hypochlorite (in addition to formalin) remove the membrane-coated protein, therefore abrogating the potential benefits of reuse. On the other hand, reuse with a mixture of peroxyacetic <span class=\"nowrap\">acid/hydrogen</span> peroxide allows the surface of the membrane to remain coated with protein, improving the membrane biocompatibility with repeated use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biochemical-mechanisms-involved-in-blood-hemodialysis-membrane-interactions/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reuse-of-dialyzers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reuse of dialyzers&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients dialyzed with some high-flux membranes may have lower serum levels of factor D because of enhanced clearance due its relatively small size. This feature of certain synthetic high-flux membranes may therefore contribute to their biocompatibility. Thus, although both the low- and high-flux configurations of polysulfone are manufactured with the same membrane (but different manufacturing process), the overall complement-activating capacity of low-flux polysulfone is much higher than that of the high-flux membrane, particularly when assessed in chronic dialysis patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Importance of factor D</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Factor D is the essential, rate-limiting enzyme of the alternate pathway of complement activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biochemical-mechanisms-involved-in-blood-hemodialysis-membrane-interactions/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Its molecular weight is 23 kD, and its plasma concentration is increased approximately 10-fold in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) due to reduced renal excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biochemical-mechanisms-involved-in-blood-hemodialysis-membrane-interactions/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The high level of functionally active factor D is directly responsible for enhanced activation of the alternate pathway in the plasma of these patients, a problem that can be enhanced by many dialysis membranes.</p><p>In vitro and in vivo studies using specific blocking antibodies against factor D have shown that blockade of factor D function impairs alternate pathway activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biochemical-mechanisms-involved-in-blood-hemodialysis-membrane-interactions/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. It is therefore possible that adsorption of factor D onto dialysis membranes could inhibit complement activation. Both <span class=\"nowrap\">PAN/AN69</span> and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) membranes remove large amounts of factor D due primarily to adsorption. Circulating factor D levels are reduced at the end of a regular hemodialysis session, the degree of which is membrane dependent: 80 percent with <span class=\"nowrap\">PAN/AN69,</span> 50 percent with PMMA, and &lt;10 percent with cellulose acetate; adsorption accounts for 98 and 85 percent of factor D removal by PAN and PMMA, while no adsorption occurs on cellulose membranes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biochemical-mechanisms-involved-in-blood-hemodialysis-membrane-interactions/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Importance of terminal complement complex</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The importance of the terminal complement complex (TCC, C5b-9, also called the membrane attack complex) may have been underappreciated in the past. Kinetic studies of TCC generation suggest ongoing generation throughout a dialysis session, in contrast to the transient release of complement-derived anaphylatoxins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biochemical-mechanisms-involved-in-blood-hemodialysis-membrane-interactions/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. One potential complication of TCC generation is amplification of noncomplement-dependent cell activation through L-fucose-dependent steps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biochemical-mechanisms-involved-in-blood-hemodialysis-membrane-interactions/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. L-fucose, present in the cuprophane membrane surfaces, provides the signal to activate mononuclear cells in contact with the membrane. Using transcription of beta-2 microglobulin as an index of cell activation, induction of beta-2 microglobulin mRNA in mononuclear cells by contact with cuprophane is increased further in the combined presence of cuprophane and serum but blunted in the presence of serum deficient in C8, suggesting that the costimulatory effect is due to TCC.</p><p>The TCC has also been implicated in the rapid decline in residual renal function in patients initiating hemodialysis and in the decreased half-life of red cells in patients dialyzed with bioincompatible membranes such as cuprophane. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-consequences-of-hemodialysis-membrane-biocompatibility\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical consequences of hemodialysis membrane biocompatibility&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Contact pathway activation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The contact pathway is activated via Hageman factor (factor XII). Negatively charged surfaces are potent activators of this pathway. PAN, with a negative charge of -153.9, induces a greater degree of activation of this pathway than the neutral cuprophane membranes. It is thought that the negative surface charge induces a conformational change of factor XII, which promotes interaction between factor XII and prekallikrein, which is facilitated by surface-bound high-molecular-weight kininogen (HMWK). Once activated, kallikrein is potent in liberating bradykinin from HMWK [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biochemical-mechanisms-involved-in-blood-hemodialysis-membrane-interactions/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. This sequence probably explains the high frequency of anaphylactoid reactions seen when PAN membranes are used in conjunction with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. ACE is also a kininase; thus, its inhibition can lead to persistence of kinins activated by the PAN membrane. Support for this hypothesis is provided by the finding that administration of a bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist prevents this reaction in sheep dialyzed with an AN69 membrane and treated with an ACE inhibitor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biochemical-mechanisms-involved-in-blood-hemodialysis-membrane-interactions/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

During hemodialysis, this cascade is purposely blunted by heparin.

Activation of neutrophils leads to upregulation of adhesion receptors, release of proteinases and other intracellular enzymes, reactive oxygen species, leukotrienes, and platelet-activating factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biochemical-mechanisms-involved-in-blood-hemodialysis-membrane-interactions/abstract/3,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,19</a>]. Activation of monocytes leads to production of monokines, such as interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Activation of platelets leads to release of thromboxanes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biochemical-mechanisms-involved-in-blood-hemodialysis-membrane-interactions/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. These factors may be important determinants of the consequences of bioincompatibility. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-consequences-of-hemodialysis-membrane-biocompatibility\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical consequences of hemodialysis membrane biocompatibility&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Properties intrinsic to the cuprophane membrane may directly cause cell activation (eg, synthesis of IL-1 mRNA by monocytes); however, it is primarily complement activation products (C5a and C5b-9) that greatly enhance the synthesis of mRNA for these cytokines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biochemical-mechanisms-involved-in-blood-hemodialysis-membrane-interactions/abstract/14,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,23</a>].

In one study analyzing the production of TNF-alpha by cuprophane membranes, no cytokine production could be attributed to the presence of endotoxin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biochemical-mechanisms-involved-in-blood-hemodialysis-membrane-interactions/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].
