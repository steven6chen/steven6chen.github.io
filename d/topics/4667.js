As a result, women with untreated CS rarely become pregnant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cushings-syndrome-in-pregnancy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, there are over 220 reported cases of CS in pregnancy, most of which were associated with important maternal and fetal complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cushings-syndrome-in-pregnancy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H469687864\"><span class=\"h2\">Normal HPA axis changes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Normal pregnancy is associated with changes in the maternal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, including increased production of cortisol-binding globulin (CBG); increased concentrations of serum, salivary, and urinary free cortisol (UFC); and lack of suppression of serum cortisol after <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a>. In addition, the placenta produces corticotropin (ACTH) and corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). Thus, the biochemical diagnosis of CS during pregnancy is more challenging than in the nonpregnant state.</p><p>Serum total and free cortisol concentrations and urinary cortisol excretion are increased in pregnant women, but the bedtime nadir of serum cortisol is maintained and urinary 17-hydroxycorticosteroid excretion is normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cushings-syndrome-in-pregnancy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Of the approximately 220 reported cases, approximately 55 percent had ACTH-independent CS (44.1 percent adenoma, 9.4 percent carcinoma, 1 percent bilateral nodular hyperplasia); most of the rest had CD or bilateral adrenal hyperplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cushings-syndrome-in-pregnancy/abstract/1,2,4,5,9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,4,5,9-11</a>]. Seven pregnant women with the ectopic ACTH syndrome have also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cushings-syndrome-in-pregnancy/abstract/1,4,5,12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,5,12-14</a>]. In nonpregnant women, adrenal adenomas (AAs) account for only approximately 15 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cushings-syndrome-in-pregnancy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The reason for this unusual pattern is not known. Pure cortisol-secreting AAs may interfere with reproductive function less than the mixed cortisol and androgen excess produced by adrenal carcinomas or ACTH-dependent adrenal hyperplasia. In addition, most patients with the ectopic ACTH syndrome are men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cushings-syndrome-in-pregnancy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>In addition to preexisting CS, pregnancy appears to induce CS in occasional cases. In a small number of patients, CS remits completely postpartum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cushings-syndrome-in-pregnancy/abstract/2,5,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,5,15</a>] and, in a few reported cases, recurs during multiple pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cushings-syndrome-in-pregnancy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Possible mechanisms include placental CRH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cushings-syndrome-in-pregnancy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], ectopic expression in the adrenal cortex of receptors for luteinizing hormone <span class=\"nowrap\">(LH)/human</span> chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cushings-syndrome-in-pregnancy/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>], and estrogen-dependent nodular adrenal hyperplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cushings-syndrome-in-pregnancy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

Unfortunately, there are no pregnancy-specific guidelines for interpretation of these tests, but currently we recommend combined use of urinary free cortisol (UFC) and late-night salivary cortisol.</p><p>We consider the diagnosis of CS in pregnancy to be established when UFC is more than <strong>four</strong> times the upper limit of normal (nonpregnant) or when salivary cortisol is <strong>two to three</strong> times above the upper limit of normal; the lack of well-established reference ranges for these tests in normal pregnancy renders diagnosis less clear in milder cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cushings-syndrome-in-pregnancy/abstract/7,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,21</a>]. The diagnosis of CS in pregnancy is also challenging because CS can easily masquerade as gestational diabetes or hypertension during pregnancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=establishing-the-diagnosis-of-cushings-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Establishing the diagnosis of Cushing's syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>One study designed to set late-night salivary cortisol reference ranges in pregnancy found that median values in pregnant women without CS were twice those of nonpregnant healthy controls. Individual values overlapped with those seen in CS patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cushings-syndrome-in-pregnancy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In this enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), the upper limit of normal values were 0.13 <span class=\"nowrap\">microgram/dL</span> (3.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> in nonpregnant control women, 0.25 <span class=\"nowrap\">microgram/dL</span> (6.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> in the first trimester, 0.26 <span class=\"nowrap\">microgram/dL</span> (7.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> in the second trimester, and 0.33 <span class=\"nowrap\">microgram/dL</span> (9.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> in the third trimester [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cushings-syndrome-in-pregnancy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>As noted above, normal pregnancy is associated with increased hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity, including an increase in UFC, cortisol-binding globulin (CBG), and <span class=\"nowrap\">total/free</span> plasma cortisol, as well as a blunted response to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> (see <a href=\"#H469687864\" class=\"local\">'Normal HPA axis changes'</a> above).

In general, those with an adrenal etiology do not suppress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cushings-syndrome-in-pregnancy/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>], while those with Cushing's disease (CD) do suppress serum cortisol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cushings-syndrome-in-pregnancy/abstract/9,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,26,27</a>]. However, this test may not identify all cases of CD, as some pregnant women may not suppress completely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cushings-syndrome-in-pregnancy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A corticotropin (ACTH) level &ndash; Because of the persistent elevations of ACTH in normal pregnancy, a suppressed ACTH is not always found in primary adrenal causes of CS. Thus, while its measurement may be useful (showing suppression), low-normal ACTH values do not exclude primary adrenal causes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients with borderline or low ACTH with or without suppression are likely to have an adrenal etiology. Ultrasound-identified adrenal lesions were present in 73 percent of cases in the series described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cushings-syndrome-in-pregnancy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. If the adrenal ultrasound is negative, we suggest an adrenal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) without a contrast agent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For women with higher or nonsuppressed ACTH levels (&gt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> [4.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">pmol/L])</span> suggestive of CD, pituitary MRI can eventually be performed, but not in the first trimester, because of concerns about potential adverse fetal effects; during the remainder of gestation, it may be performed but <strong>not</strong> with gadolinium contrast, which is labeled by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as a class C drug. Performing MRI during pregnancy without gadolinium contrast reduces its sensitivity; it may be able to identify a pituitary macroadenoma, but it is less likely to identify a microadenoma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) stimulation and inferior petrosal sinus sampling (IPSS) have been reported in less than 10 pregnant patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cushings-syndrome-in-pregnancy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. If IPSS is done, access via the jugular vein, with abdominal and chest lead shielding, is recommended to reduce radiation exposure to the fetus during fluoroscopy. These tests are helpful in women with ACTH values &gt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">pg/mL</span> (4.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">pmol/L)</span> who may have CD.

In the series of 136 pregnant women with Cushing's syndrome (CS) described above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cushings-syndrome-in-pregnancy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], the live birth rate appeared to be slightly better in women who received early treatment compared with those who were managed conservatively; 50 live births out of 56 pregnancies (89 percent) if treatment started at a mean gestational age of 20 weeks, versus 59 live births out of 74 pregnancies (76 percent) in the group receiving no therapy in the third trimester [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cushings-syndrome-in-pregnancy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, complications, including premature delivery and eclampsia, occurred in some women in spite of treatment.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=society-guideline-links-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-cushings-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_society_guidelines\">&quot;Society guideline links: Diagnosis and treatment of Cushing's syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Up to 75 percent of women with Cushing's syndrome (CS) have ovulatory disorders as a result of their cortisol excess. Thus, women with untreated CS rarely become pregnant. (See <a href=\"#H378112392\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Of those who do become pregnant, approximately 55 percent have corticotropin (ACTH)-independent hypercortisolism (primarily adrenal adenomas [AAs]). This pattern is different from that seen in nonpregnant individuals with CS, the majority of whom have ACTH-dependent hypercortisolism (ACTH-secreting pituitary tumors). (See <a href=\"#H378112392\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The evaluation of suspected CS in pregnancy differs from that for nonpregnant patients. Unfortunately, there are no pregnancy-specific guidelines for interpretation of these tests, but currently, we recommend combined use of urinary free cortisol (UFC) and late-night salivary cortisol. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Additional evaluation to determine cause'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest surgical resection of adrenal adenomas causing CS during pregnancy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). This is typically performed at 16 to 21 weeks of pregnancy without complicating the pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women who do not want surgery or are diagnosed later, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metyrapone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metyrapone</a> to control maternal hypercortisolism (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). It may become necessary to induce early delivery of the fetus if complications of eclampsia supervene. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transsphenoidal surgery for Cushing's disease (CD) has been performed in the second trimester without complicating the pregnancy.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cushings-syndrome-in-pregnancy/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Aron DC, Schnall AM, Sheeler LR.
