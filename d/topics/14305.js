Opportunistic diseases have become less common, and mortality has declined such that most treated HIV-infected patients now have a near normal life expectancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-the-hiv-infected-adult/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. More than 50 percent of deaths in HIV-infected patients receiving ART are now related to conditions other than AIDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-the-hiv-infected-adult/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. HIV infection appears to increase the risk of non-AIDS-related cardiovascular disease, renal disease, liver disease, and malignancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-the-hiv-infected-adult/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In addition, a variety of long-term complications associated with ART have been described.</p><p>The emergence of non-AIDS-related conditions highlights the important role of the primary care physician. Based on experience from other chronic medical conditions, general practitioners are well suited to oversee and coordinate a multidisciplinary approach to HIV care. One survey of 102 internal medicine physicians and 75 infectious disease specialists found that generalists with extensive experience in HIV management provided high-quality care to these complex patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-the-hiv-infected-adult/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In the United States, there will be a future need for increased involvement of primary practitioners in HIV care given the growing prevalence of persons living with HIV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-the-hiv-infected-adult/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>The role of the primary physician in the care of the HIV-infected adult will be discussed here, with particular attention to clinical monitoring and health care maintenance. The initial evaluation of the HIV-infected adult is addressed elsewhere.

This issue is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-of-the-hiv-infected-adult\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation of the HIV-infected adult&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1791711014\"><span class=\"h1\">FREQUENCY OF CLINICAL EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The appropriate frequency of medical visits for an HIV-infected adult depends on many factors, including the stage of HIV infection, the use of antiretroviral therapy (ART), and the presence of other medical or social comorbidities and complications. As an example, frequent visits may be appropriate for patients who are recently diagnosed or newly linked to care. Frequent visits are also warranted after the initiation of ART to evaluate efficacy and tolerability. However, once the viral load has been suppressed and the CD4 cell count is increased and stable, less frequent monitoring is appropriate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-the-hiv-infected-adult/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=patient-monitoring-during-hiv-antiretroviral-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Patient monitoring during HIV antiretroviral therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H40\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT OF ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goals of antiretroviral therapy (ART) are to prolong life and improve its quality, restore and preserve immunologic function (as measured by CD4 count), and maximally and durably suppress the HIV viral load [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-the-hiv-infected-adult/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Although eradication of HIV infection is not achievable with current management approaches, ART has resulted in significant reductions in HIV-related morbidity and mortality. Such benefits of ART have been reported even in patients with normal CD4 cell counts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-the-hiv-infected-adult/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Thus, initiation of ART for all HIV-infected patients, regardless of CD4 cell count, is recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-the-hiv-infected-adult/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Initiation, management, and monitoring the efficacy of ART are fundamental components in the care of the HIV-infected adult.

These may be associated with HIV-infection itself, risk factors prevalent in HIV-infected populations, or the use of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Optimal care of the HIV-infected patient requires knowledge about and evaluation for such potential complications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F96776\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef96776 \">table 1</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1356106898\"><span class=\"h2\">Hematologic, renal, and hepatic toxicity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HIV infection has been associated with abnormalities of bone marrow, kidney, and liver function, either directly or secondary to comorbid conditions. Evaluation for such underlying abnormalities should be done at the initial presentation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-of-the-hiv-infected-adult#H955927251\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation of the HIV-infected adult&quot;, section on 'General blood and urine testing'</a>.)</p><p>For patients who have not yet initiated ART, routine monitoring for these abnormalities is warranted, for example with a complete blood count (CBC) with differential every three to six months and a chemistry panel including BUN and creatinine, serum transaminases, and bilirubin level every 6 to 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-the-hiv-infected-adult/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>For patients who are on ART, monitoring should be more frequent because of the potential for drug-associated toxicity.

The degree to which HIV infection itself, traditional cardiovascular risk factors, and ART (eg, protease inhibitors) each contribute to the increased risk of cardiovascular disease in the HIV-infected population is unknown. It is of paramount importance that clinicians identify and initiate appropriate preventive interventions for cardiovascular risk factors in HIV-infected patients. Assessment and management of cardiovascular risk and disease in HIV-infected adults are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-cardiovascular-risk-including-dyslipidemia-in-the-hiv-infected-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of cardiovascular risk (including dyslipidemia) in the HIV-infected patient&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-cardiovascular-disease-and-risk-factors-in-hiv-infected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of cardiovascular disease and risk factors in HIV-infected patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H46\"><span class=\"h3\">Dyslipidemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies have consistently shown a high prevalence of dyslipidemia among HIV-infected patients, with and without ART. Certain agents, such as earlier generation protease inhibitors, have been associated with a greater risk of unfavorable lipid changes. Thus, HIV-infected patients should undergo lipid testing routinely throughout care. As an example, several expert groups in the United States recommend screening for dyslipidemia at baseline, annually if not on ART, prior to initiating ART, within one to three months after starting a new ART regimen, and every 6 to 12 months thereafter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-care-of-the-hiv-infected-adult/abstract/8,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,13,14</a>].</p><p>Management of dyslipidemia consists of lifestyle modification, consideration of switching to a more &quot;lipid-friendly&quot; ART regimen if appropriate, and pharmacologic treatment with statins when appropriate for cardiovascular risk reduction. Standard cardiovascular risk calculators do not incorporate the presence of HIV infection. It remains uncertain whether the indications for statin initiation should be the same as those for the general population or should be more aggressive for HIV-infected patients. When starting lipid-lowering agents, it is important to be aware of potential drug-drug interactions. Depending upon the ART regimen, some drugs are contraindicated, and others should be administered in lower dosages initially with monitoring for drug toxicity.

(See <a href=\"#H45\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring for complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunizations are an important part of preventive care for HIV-infected patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F93620\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef93620 \">figure 1</a>). Inactivated vaccines are generally safe and acceptable in HIV infected individuals. Certain live vaccines have sufficient safety data and are thus appropriate if indicated for HIV-infected individuals with CD4 cell counts &gt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunizations-in-hiv-infected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunizations in HIV-infected patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Behavioral risk reduction counseling is an important part of the management of HIV-infected patients. At each visit, practitioners should review the patient's understanding of HIV transmission and <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> sexual and drug-use activities. Other relevant counseling issues for HIV-infected patients may include food, pet, and travel safety.
