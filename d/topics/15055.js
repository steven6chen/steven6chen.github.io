Delayed separation and expulsion of the placenta is a potentially life-threatening event because it interferes with normal postpartum contraction of the uterus, which can lead to hemorrhage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H104793540\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Retained placenta can be defined as lack of expulsion of the placenta within 30 minutes of delivery of the infant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retained-placenta-after-vaginal-birth/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. This is a reasonable definition in the third trimester when the third stage of labor is actively managed (ie, administration of a uterotonic agent before delivery of the placenta, controlled cord traction) because 98 percent of placentas are expelled by 30 minutes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F78067\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78067 \">figure 1</a>) in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retained-placenta-after-vaginal-birth/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>In the second trimester, however, the risk of retained placenta at 30 minutes is higher (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F69724\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69724 \">figure 2</a>). In addition, with physiological management of the third stage (ie, delivery of the placenta without the use of uterotonic agents or cord traction),&nbsp;it takes about 60 minutes before 98 percent of placentas are expelled. These findings suggest that the definition, or the timing of intervention, should take into account the gestational age at delivery and how the third stage of labor is managed. In part for these reasons, the World Health Organization (WHO) concluded that the length of time before making a diagnosis of retained placenta should be &ldquo;left to the judgement of the clinician&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retained-placenta-after-vaginal-birth/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

It cannot be cleanly separated, although the placenta may still be removed vaginally if the area of attachment is small.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H104791140\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultrasound studies have identified four phases in the third stage of labor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retained-placenta-after-vaginal-birth/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Latent phase &ndash; Immediately after birth, all of the myometrium contracts except for the portion beneath the placenta.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contraction phase &ndash; The retroplacental myometrium contracts.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Detachment phase &ndash; Contraction of the retroplacental myometrium produces horizontal (shear) stress on the maternal surface of the placenta, causing it to detach.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Expulsion phase &ndash; Myometrial contractions expel the detached placenta from the uterus.</p><p/><p>Retained placenta may be attributed to abnormalities in one or more of these phases. </p><p>Placenta adherens appears to result from contractile failure in the retroplacental area (ie, a prolonged latent phase of the third stage of labor) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retained-placenta-after-vaginal-birth/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Histological studies suggest that this may be due to placental changes associated with oxidative stress or preeclampsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retained-placenta-after-vaginal-birth/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. It has been hypothesized that localized failure of myometrial contractility may be present throughout labor and result in both dysfunctional labor and placenta adherens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retained-placenta-after-vaginal-birth/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. If the localized contractile failure is severe, then a cesarean delivery may be needed for failure to progress. If localized contractile failure is not severe, then the woman may achieve vaginal delivery, but is at increased risk of a placenta adherens.&nbsp;</p><p>A trapped placenta may be seen as a failure of the expulsion phase, where the lower uterine segment and cervix contract before the placenta separates, or if expulsive or gravitational forces are inadequate to deliver the placenta.</p><p>The pathogenesis of placenta accreta<strong> </strong>is completely different, as it is a structural rather than a functional abnormality. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-placenta-accreta-spectrum-placenta-accreta-increta-and-percreta#H3937332\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of placenta accreta spectrum (placenta accreta, increta, and percreta)&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H104791608\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The overall prevalence of retained placenta varies across settings and over time. In a systematic review of observational studies, the median prevalence of retained placenta at 30 minutes in high-resource settings was 2.7 percent of vaginal deliveries compared with 1.5 percent in low-resource settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retained-placenta-after-vaginal-birth/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The prevalence has also been increasing: a review of historical data from nine hospitals in the British Isles reported an increase from 0.5 percent in the 1930s to 2.3 percent in the 1980s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retained-placenta-after-vaginal-birth/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In 2005-2006, the prevalence of retained placenta in the author&rsquo;s hospital was 3.3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retained-placenta-after-vaginal-birth/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The difference in prevalence between the least and most developed countries and the observed increase in prevalence over time are probably related to differences in epidemiology and risk factors.</p><p>In the author&rsquo;s large prospective audit of cases of retained placenta resolved without hysterectomy, trapped placenta, placenta adherens, and placenta accreta accounted for 13, 81, and 6 percent of cases, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retained-placenta-after-vaginal-birth/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In another series, trapped placenta accounted for 51 percent of placentas manually removed to prevent postpartum hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retained-placenta-after-vaginal-birth/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Although small areas of focal placenta accreta are not uncommon at vaginal delivery, a complete placenta accreta is rare, as most affected patients are delivered by repeat cesarean delivery. These patients typically have a history of previous cesarean delivery and placenta previa, which are indications for repeat cesarean delivery. We estimate only 1 in 440 women who have a retained placenta following vaginal delivery will have placenta accreta. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-placenta-accreta-spectrum-placenta-accreta-increta-and-percreta\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of placenta accreta spectrum (placenta accreta, increta, and percreta)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H104791614\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The duration of the third stage of labor is influenced by a variety of factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retained-placenta-after-vaginal-birth/abstract/7,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,13</a>]. In a series of &gt;91,000 singleton vaginal deliveries &ge;24 weeks of gestation, significant predictors of retained placenta included stillbirth, maternal age &ge;30 years, delivery at 24<sup><span class=\"nowrap\">0/7</sup></span> to 27<sup><span class=\"nowrap\">6/7</sup></span> weeks compared with &ge;34 weeks, and delivery in a teaching hospital [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retained-placenta-after-vaginal-birth/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Non-Hispanic black race was protective compared with non-Hispanic white race; body mass index was not associated with an increased risk.</p><p>Preterm gestational age was the most important risk factor in another large study (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F69724\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69724 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retained-placenta-after-vaginal-birth/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p>In addition, active management of the third stage of labor with ergometrine appears to be significant risk factor for a prolonged third stage. This is likely a peculiarity of ergometrine which, in contrast to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a>, causes a powerful, continuous uterine contraction. With intravenous administration, the onset of uterine contraction is immediate and closes the cervix at the same time as placental detachment occurs, thus trapping the placenta behind a closed cervix. The only trial to study use of intravenous ergometrine for management of the third stage of labor found a massive increase in the need for manual removal of the placenta (RR 19.5, 95% CI 2.6-145.4) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retained-placenta-after-vaginal-birth/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This finding was supported by data from a population study in Sweden [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retained-placenta-after-vaginal-birth/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The retained placenta rate in 10 centers that routinely used methylergometrine was significantly higher than those that used oxytocin alone (2.7 versus 1.8 percent). </p><p>Uterine abnormalities may also be a risk factor for a prolonged third stage. In a series of 63 pregnancies in women with M&uuml;llerian duct fusion abnormalities, 17 percent had retained placentas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retained-placenta-after-vaginal-birth/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, these anomalies are rare (0.2 percent) and probably account for no more than 1.5 percent of retained placentas. Subtle uterine abnormalities are more common in the population and are possible risk factors for retained placenta. A study that performed routine hysteroscopy six weeks after manual removal of a retained placenta in 48 women reported 15 percent had an incomplete uterine septum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retained-placenta-after-vaginal-birth/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Defective placental implantation may be the underlying reason that intrauterine growth restriction and stillbirth have been associated with retained placenta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retained-placenta-after-vaginal-birth/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>A velamentous cord insertion is a risk factor for manual removal of the placenta, which has been described in 5.5 percent of pregnancies with this cord abnormality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retained-placenta-after-vaginal-birth/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Presumably breakage of the fragile cord at delivery resulted in a retained placenta.</p><p>Lastly, a previous retained placenta is a risk factor for recurrence. Following a retained placenta in any previous pregnancy, the odds of recurrence were 12.6 (95% CI 3.6-44.1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retained-placenta-after-vaginal-birth/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]) in one study and 6.25 percent in another [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retained-placenta-after-vaginal-birth/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H104790703\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FINDINGS AND DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of retained placenta is made when the placenta has not been expelled within 30 minutes of delivery of the infant. (See <a href=\"#H104793540\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above.)</p><p>A diagnosis of trapped placenta is made when the classic clinical signs of placental separation are present (lengthening of the umbilical cord, gush of blood from the vagina, change in the shape of the uterine fundus from discoid to globular, elevation of the fundal height, and contraction of the fundus) and the edge of the placenta is palpable through a narrow cervical os.</p><p>A diagnosis of placenta adherens or placenta accreta is made in the absence of signs and symptoms of placental separation. Placenta adherens is generally only clinically distinguishable from placenta accreta at the time of attempted manual removal. If a clean plane of separation can be created between the entire placenta and decidua, the diagnosis is placenta adherens. If areas of myometrial invasion prevent clean separation of part of the placenta, the diagnosis is focal placenta accreta. However, a mild focal placenta accreta can be difficult to distinguish clinically from placenta adherens.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H104790845\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultrasound can differentiate between a detached trapped placenta and an adherent placenta, but is rarely performed unless the diagnosis is uncertain after physical examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retained-placenta-after-vaginal-birth/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. With a trapped placenta, the myometrium is thickened all around the uterus and the placenta is seen sitting external to the uterine body in the lower segment. By contrast, with an adherent placenta the myometrium will be thickened in all areas except where the placenta is attached, where it will be very thin or even invisible (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F65797\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef65797 \">image 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3034216878\"><span class=\"h2\">Placental pathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A case-control study performed macroscopic and histological analysis of adherens type retained (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;49) and non-retained (n&nbsp;=&nbsp;47) term singleton placentas from otherwise healthy pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retained-placenta-after-vaginal-birth/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Adherens type retained placentas had a significantly smaller surface area, were more oblong in shape, and had more signs of maternal underperfusion. They also had more basal plate myometrial fibers, but focal accreta was not increased. This is consistent with the association of retained placenta with intrauterine growth restriction and stillbirth (see <a href=\"#H104791614\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above), but suggests the association is with adherens type rather than focal accreta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retained-placenta-after-vaginal-birth/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H104794261\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The two most common complications of retained placenta are postpartum hemorrhage and postpartum endometritis. Uterine inversion is less common. The frequency of these complications depends on multiple factors, including the definition used, etiology, and management of the retained placenta. </p><p>In high-resource settings, deaths from retained placenta are very rare. In settings with fewer resources, however, the case fatality rate is commonly around 1 percent, depending on women's ability to access services [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retained-placenta-after-vaginal-birth/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H104795171\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR INTERVENTION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H362083732\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients with severe bleeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Severe bleeding is an obstetric emergency that requires prompt intervention (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postpartum-hemorrhage-medical-and-minimally-invasive-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postpartum hemorrhage: Medical and minimally invasive management&quot;</a>). The retained placenta should be manually removed as soon as possible. Expulsion of the placenta promotes global uterine contraction and will likely reduce bleeding. (See <a href=\"#H974299938\" class=\"local\">'Perform manual extraction'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H362083738\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients without severe bleeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When the placenta has been retained for 30 minutes in a stable patient delivered in the third trimester, we perform a physical examination (and sometimes ultrasound) to determine whether the placenta is merely trapped or still adherent (see <a href=\"#H104790703\" class=\"local\">'Clinical findings and diagnosis'</a> above) and begin preparations for intervention. (See <a href=\"#H6052644\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> below.)</p><p>The optimum timing of intervention balances the risks of leaving the placenta in situ (postpartum hemorrhage) and the risks of intervention (postpartum hemorrhage <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> infection, uterine trauma) versus the likelihood that the placenta will spontaneously deliver with expectant management. Available data suggest that the risk of hemorrhage begins to increase 20 to 30 minutes after birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retained-placenta-after-vaginal-birth/abstract/7,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,25,26</a>]; however, delaying intervention until at least 30 minutes have elapsed will lead to spontaneous delivery of many placentas. Waiting as long as 60 minutes is reasonable if an intervention can be promptly and successfully initiated if the patient begins to bleed.</p><p>There is no consensus worldwide as to when intervention is indicated. We suggest discontinuing expectant management at 60 minutes. However, this time period could be extended for deliveries in the second trimester where the risk of retained placenta is higher (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F69724\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69724 \">figure 2</a>) and the risk of hemorrhage is lower. There are very limited data to guide the maximum duration of expectant management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retained-placenta-after-vaginal-birth/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>], but we suggest not delaying intervention by more than two hours from delivery of the infant due to the risk of infection and bleeding. In a trial including 51 women with retained placenta at 60 minutes and no pharmacologic intervention, 23 women (45 percent) eventually expelled the placenta spontaneously, but 24 of the 51 women (47 percent) bled over 1000 mLs and 9 (18 percent) were transfused [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retained-placenta-after-vaginal-birth/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6052644\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following steps in the approach to managing a retained placenta is based on our understanding of the etiology, pathophysiology, and complications of this disorder.

For the Brandt-Andrews maneuver, one hand is placed on the abdomen to secure the uterine fundus and prevent uterine inversion while the other hand exerts sustained downward traction parallel to the direction of the birth canal on the umbilical cord [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retained-placenta-after-vaginal-birth/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

Prostaglandin F2-alpha (carboprost) may also be of benefit if bleeding is severe and not controlled with oxytocin. Ergometrine should be avoided, if possible, as it constricts the cervix, making manual removal very difficult. If severe bleeding persists, then aortic compression (checking that it has been effective by feeling for loss of femoral pulse) is an important adjunct to stop pelvic blood flow while arrangements for laparotomy are made.

Other options include administration of sequential bolus intravenous injections: 50 micrograms, maximum cumulative dose 200 micrograms, until sufficient uterine relaxation is achieved to allow manual removal of the placenta, or sublingual tablets 0.6 to 1.0 milligrams. Uterine relaxation occurs within 60 seconds after the dose and lasts for one to two minutes.</p><p>Blood pressure should be monitored continuously, as a drop in blood pressure always occurs, although most patients do not become hypotensive.

For this reason, we agree with the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendation to administer antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retained-placenta-after-vaginal-birth/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>], although there are no data to support or refute this practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retained-placenta-after-vaginal-birth/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

If the opening of the cervix is too small to admit the clinician&rsquo;s hand, uterine relaxation may be achieved with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a> (glyceryl trinitrate) (see <a href=\"#H974299662\" class=\"local\">'Excessive cervical/uterine contraction'</a> above). The plane of interface, which feels velvety and irregular, is gently dissected using a side-to-side motion of the fingers until the placenta has been completely separated. </p><p>There is no role for routine uterine curettage or aspiration after manual extraction. It has no benefit and carries the risk of uterine perforation and Asherman syndrome. Routine ultrasound evaluation of the uterus after manual extraction is also unnecessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retained-placenta-after-vaginal-birth/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H179219149\"><span class=\"h3\">Instrument extraction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If digital extraction is not possible, large-headed forceps (eg, Bierer forceps, ring forceps) can be used to grip and extract the placenta in pieces or intact; ultrasound guidance can be helpful. One group describes grasping the placental tissue with Bierer forceps under ultrasound guidance and applying slow, gentle traction in short strokes, regrasping increasingly more distal areas of placenta as needed to gently extract the placenta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retained-placenta-after-vaginal-birth/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. The procedure requires less analgesia than digital extraction. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H974301218\"><span class=\"h3\">Incomplete extraction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During manual placental extraction, the clinician may note a small area where the placenta is very adherent to the uterus. This can usually be managed by slow persistent finger dissection to create a plane of separation at the maternal-placental interface. The plane of dissection is often partially through the placenta in these cases, which leaves some placenta adherent to the decidua and myometrium. This will not lead to postpartum hemorrhage as long as the uterus contracts well and there is no area of subinvolution at the site of the retained placental fragments. Curettage should be avoided, if possible, as the myometrium may be very thin at the point of adherence, thus increasing the risk of perforation. Curettage of the postpartum uterus also increases the risk of formation of intrauterine adhesions (Asherman syndrome). </p><p>However, if placental tissue is retained and the patient is bleeding excessively, then curettage using a large blunt placental curette or aspiration is reasonable to remove the remaining placental tissue.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H974301224\"><span class=\"h3\">Unexpected placenta accreta</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rarely, a complete placenta accreta is first recognized at the time of manual removal of the placenta. In these cases, there is no plane of dissection between the uterus and placenta and, almost invariably, attempts at manual removal lead to life-threatening hemorrhage. We suggest administration of uterotonic drugs and preparation for hysterectomy, which is the definitive therapy of placenta accreta. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-placenta-accreta-spectrum-placenta-accreta-increta-and-percreta\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the placenta accreta spectrum (placenta accreta, increta, and percreta)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H974300987\"><span class=\"h2\">Other approaches</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no high-quality evidence that any pharmacologic therapy is effective for expulsion of placenta adherens in patients who have been managed with parenteral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a> and cord traction as part of active management of the third stage of labor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retained-placenta-after-vaginal-birth/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. </p><p>It has been hypothesized that administration of an additional uterotonic drug may be effective in this setting, in part because placenta adherens appears to result from contractile failure in the retroplacental area. Although ergot derivatives cause the uterus to contract, limited evidence suggests these drugs are no more effective than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a> alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retained-placenta-after-vaginal-birth/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Furthermore, a powerful, continuous uterine contraction makes subsequent manual extraction more difficult. &#160; </p><p>We also recommend avoiding intraumbilical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a> injection or administration of prostaglandins by any route for management of retained placenta. In meta-analyses of placebo-controlled randomized trials, none of these interventions resulted in a significant reduction in need for manual removal of retained placenta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/retained-placenta-after-vaginal-birth/abstract/44,46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,46,47</a>].

This time period can be extended to 90 to 120 minutes for births in the second trimester and third stages of labor managed without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a>. (See <a href=\"#H104793540\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The three etiologies of retained placenta are: the placenta may be trapped behind a partially closed cervix (trapped or incarcerated placenta); the placenta may be adherent to the uterine wall, but easily separated manually (placenta adherens); or the placenta may be pathologically invading the myometrium (placenta accreta). (See <a href=\"#H104790879\" class=\"local\">'Types of retained placenta'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The strongest risk factor for retained placenta is gestational age less than 26 weeks (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F69724\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69724 \">figure 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H104791614\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A diagnosis of trapped placenta is made when the classic clinical signs of placental separation are present (lengthening of the umbilical cord, gush of blood from the vagina, change in the shape of the uterine fundus from discoid to globular, elevation of the fundal height, and contraction of the fundus) and the edge of the placenta is palpable through a narrow cervical os.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A diagnosis of placenta adherens or placenta accreta is made in the absence of signs and symptoms of placental separation. Placenta adherens is indistinguishable from placenta accreta until the time of attempted manual removal. If a clean plane of separation can be created between the entire placenta and decidua, the diagnosis is placenta adherens. If areas of myometrial invasion prevent clean separation of part of the placenta, the diagnosis is focal placenta accreta. (See <a href=\"#H104790703\" class=\"local\">'Clinical findings and diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postpartum hemorrhage is the major complication of retained placenta. (See <a href=\"#H104794261\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe bleeding is an obstetric emergency that requires prompt intervention. The retained placenta should be manually removed as soon as possible. (See <a href=\"#H362083732\" class=\"local\">'Patients with severe bleeding'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the absence of heavy bleeding, we suggest intervention when the third-trimester placenta has been retained for 30 to 60 minutes rather than expectant management or earlier intervention (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H362083738\" class=\"local\">'Patients without severe bleeding'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Gentle cord traction is the initial maneuver. If unsuccessful and the lower <span class=\"nowrap\">uterus/cervix</span> is constricted, we administer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a> (glyceryl trinitrate) to release the constriction. If the uterus is atonic, we administer an <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a> infusion to promote uterine contraction. If these measures fail to result in placental expulsion, we suggest manual rather than instrumental extraction of the placenta (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H6052644\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We suggest administering a single dose of a broad spectrum prophylactic antibiotic before manual extraction of the placenta (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H974299938\" class=\"local\">'Perform manual extraction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with a second-trimester birth and no significant bleeding, the time period before manual extraction can be extended as the frequency of retained placenta is higher and the risk of hemorrhage is lower. We suggest not waiting more than two hours due to the risk of infection (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H6052644\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with a small area of placenta accreta, we slowly create a plane of separation at the maternal-placental interface using finger dissection. Curettage is a second-line option if finger dissection is unsuccessful.
