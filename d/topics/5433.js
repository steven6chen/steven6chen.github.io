The &quot;dilation&quot; refers to dilation of the cervix, the lower part of the uterus that opens into the vagina (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80271\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80271 \">figure 1</a>). &quot;Curettage&quot; refers to the scraping or removal of tissue lining the uterine cavity (endometrium) with a surgical instrument called a curette.</p><p>D and C may be done to diagnose a problem, such as irregular or excessive menstrual bleeding, or as a treatment for miscarriage. This topic discusses the reasons for D and C, how to prepare for the procedure, and what to expect afterwards.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">REASONS FOR D AND C</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a number of reasons a D and C might be performed. In some cases, the procedure is used to gain information about the uterus to diagnose a medical condition (called a diagnostic D and C). In other cases, the procedure is used to treat a medical problem or condition (called a therapeutic D and C).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic D and C</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary reason for a diagnostic D and C is to obtain samples of the endometrium to evaluate abnormal uterine bleeding or to look for abnormal cells that may be from the uterus that were found during routine screening for cervical cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-cancer-screening-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Cervical cancer screening (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In most cases, a healthcare provider will try to obtain a tissue sample with an office procedure called an endometrial biopsy. In some cases, endometrial biopsy is not possible or insufficient tissue is obtained. When this occurs, a D and C must be done to obtain an adequate tissue sample.</p><p>Diagnostic D and C is sometimes done in combination with another procedure called hysteroscopy; this involves dilating the cervix and inserting a small instrument to examine and photograph the inside of the uterus. The images are displayed on a monitor, allowing the physician to visualize the endometrium. This helps the physician to avoid missing small polyps that are inside the uterus and ensures that the most visibly abnormal areas are sampled. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abnormal-uterine-bleeding-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Abnormal uterine bleeding (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A pathologist then examines the tissue with a microscope to establish certain diagnoses, including endometrial (uterine) cancer, endometrial polyps, or precancerous conditions of the lining of the uterus (endometrial hyperplasia). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometrial-cancer-diagnosis-and-staging-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Endometrial cancer diagnosis and staging (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Therapeutic D and C</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Therapeutic D and C is done to remove the contents of the uterus in the following circumstances:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Miscarriage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In some miscarriages, the tissues from a pregnancy are passed completely. In other cases, a D and C is needed to remove this tissue or to ensure that all of it has been passed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=miscarriage-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Miscarriage (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Abortion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A D and C can be done to remove the contents of the uterus when a woman chooses to end a pregnancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-pregnancy-termination\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of pregnancy termination&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment of molar pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A molar pregnancy occurs when a tumor forms in place of normal pregnancy placenta. It is often treated with a D and C. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydatidiform-mole-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hydatidiform mole: Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Prolonged or excessive vaginal bleeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A D and C may be done as a treatment in some cases of prolonged or excessive bleeding that do not respond to medical treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abnormal-uterine-bleeding-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Abnormal uterine bleeding (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Postpartum hemorrhage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Curettage may be done to manage excessive bleeding after delivery of an infant (postpartum hemorrhage). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-postpartum-hemorrhage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of postpartum hemorrhage&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">PREPARING FOR D AND C</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some patients will need to have blood testing before D and C (such as a blood count or tests of clotting factors), although this is not always necessary. You should not eat or drink anything starting the night before the procedure. You will need someone to accompany you home because it will not be safe to drive after receiving anesthesia, which causes sedation.</p><p>You may need to have a device or medication placed in or near the cervix the day before your procedure. The purpose of this procedure is to safely and gradually enlarge the cervical opening, reducing the risk of cervical injury when the D and C is performed. Devices are used when the cervix must be dilated to a larger size than is typically needed for D and C, such as with pregnancy terminations and some types of hysteroscopy. You may be instructed to insert a medicine in your vagina to soften your cervix prior to the procedure.</p><p>After arriving for the procedure, a nurse may place an intravenous line, which can be used to give fluids and medicine before, during, and after the procedure. The nurse or doctor will review your medical history, list of medications used, and any drug allergies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">D AND C PROCEDURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A D and C can be performed in an operating room in a hospital, clinic or out-patient surgery center. Your blood pressure, pulse, and blood oxygen levels are monitored during the procedure. The procedure itself typically takes only 15 to 30 minutes to complete.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Anesthesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The procedure can be done using general, regional, or local block anesthesia. The type of anesthesia chosen depends upon the reason for the procedure as well as your medical history.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">CARE AFTER D AND C</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After the procedure, you will rest in a recovery or post-anesthesia care unit for a few hours. This is necessary to monitor for excessive vaginal bleeding or other complications, and allows time for you to recover from the anesthesia. If you were given general anesthesia, you may have nausea and vomiting, which can be treated with medications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Recovery at home</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You should be able to resume your regular activities within a day or two. Mild cramping and spotting may occur for a few hours or days; cramping can be treated with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (Advil, Motrin). You should not put anything inside the vagina (tampons, douches) during this time and should ask when you can safely have sexual intercourse. Your next menstrual period usually occurs within four to six weeks of the procedure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">When to call for help</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You should call your physician if you develop fever (temperature greater than 101&ordm; F), cramps lasting longer than 48 hours, increasing rather than decreasing pain, prolonged or heavy bleeding, or foul-smelling vaginal discharge.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">D AND C COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>D and C is a commonly performed procedure that is usually very safe. Yet as with any operation, complications can occur. Complications of D and C include:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Uterine perforation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Uterine perforation occurs when one of the surgical instruments makes a hole in the uterus. It is more common when the procedure is done during pregnancy due to softening of the uterine wall.</p><p>Fortunately, most uterine perforations heal on their own and do not require any treatment. Two potential problems caused by perforation are bleeding from injury to a blood vessel and injury to other internal organs. A second procedure may be needed to repair these types of injuries.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Cervical injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Injuries to the cervix can occur during dilation or from trauma related to the curettage. Lacerations (cuts) to the cervix are managed with pressure to the area, application of medications that help stop bleeding, or in some cases, stitches in the cervix.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infection from a D and C is rare.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Intrauterine adhesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adhesions (areas of scar tissue) can sometimes form in the uterus following D and C. Adhesions occur most commonly when a D and C is performed during or after pregnancy. In some cases, this can lead to abnormalities in the menstrual cycle, painful menstrual cycles, infertility, or miscarriage. If adhesions are extensive, you can be treated with a combination of hormones to encourage growth of healthy uterine tissue and the removal of the scarred tissue with a surgical procedure.
