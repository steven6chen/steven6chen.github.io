Accelerated schedules include &quot;rush&quot; and &quot;ultra-rush.&quot;</p><p>This topic review will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of rush and ultra-rush schedules for VIT, indications for accelerated VIT, and provide several specific examples of protocols that have been used successfully. Conventional schedules for VIT are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-technical-issues-protocols-adverse-effects-and-monitoring\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hymenoptera venom immunotherapy: Technical issues, protocols, adverse effects, and monitoring&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stings-of-imported-fire-ants-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stings of imported fire ants: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7152382\"><span class=\"h2\">Terminology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All forms of subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) are divided into two phases: build-up and maintenance.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The build-up phase involves serial injections of increasing amounts of allergen. During this phase, tolerance to the allergen is gradually induced and the patient's immune response to the allergen is modified from a T helper type 2 (Th2) phenotype to a T helper type 1 (Th1) phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rush-and-ultra-rush-venom-immunotherapy-for-hymenoptera-allergy/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. In conventional VIT schedules, the build-up phase involves one or three injections per week and extends from 8 to 21 weeks. Conventional schedules for VIT are shown in the tables (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F51030\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51030 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F64856\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64856 \">table 2</a>). Th2 and Th1 responses are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;T helper subsets: Differentiation and role in disease&quot;, section on 'Functional differences of T helper subsets'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The maintenance phase of allergen immunotherapy involves ongoing injections of an immunizing dose of allergen, usually at intervals of three to six weeks. During the maintenance phase, the immune transformation becomes complete. This phase is usually extended for a period of three to five years because shorter durations of treatment are associated with higher rates of recurrent systemic allergic reactions to subsequent stings. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-determining-duration-of-therapy#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hymenoptera venom immunotherapy: Determining duration of therapy&quot;, section on 'Duration of treatment'</a>.)</p><p/><p>Accelerated protocols for VIT are categorized as either rush or ultra-rush schedules, although these terms have not been strictly defined. Accelerated schedules of immunotherapy involve shortening the length of the build-up phase, while the maintenance phase remains the same. The length of the build-up phase depends upon the frequency of the injections and the incremental dose increase between consecutive injections. Thus, accelerated schedules either involve administering more injections per visit, increasing the dose more between consecutive injections, or both.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6515476\"><span class=\"h3\">Rush</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rush VIT schedules involve administering the build-up phase over two to three consecutive days until the maintenance dose is achieved (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F80931\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80931 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rush-and-ultra-rush-venom-immunotherapy-for-hymenoptera-allergy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The maintenance dose is then given at one-week intervals for two doses, then two-week intervals for two doses, then three-week intervals for two doses, then monthly thereafter.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13460684\"><span class=\"h3\">Ultra-rush</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultra-rush VIT uses a more rapid one-day build-up phase. The final dose on the first day is typically slightly lower than the full maintenance dose, although the patient has received a cumulative dose of allergen close to the 100 mcg maintenance dose of an individual venom (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F62051\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62051 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rush-and-ultra-rush-venom-immunotherapy-for-hymenoptera-allergy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. On the next scheduled visit, the patient usually receives a full maintenance dose, which is repeated monthly thereafter. Compared with rush schedules, ultra-rush schedules expose the patient to a lower cumulative dose of venom during the build-up phase.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7152403\"><span class=\"h1\">ADVANTAGES AND SAFETY OF ACCELERATED IMMUNOTHERAPY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6515795\"><span class=\"h2\">Advantages</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Advantages of accelerated venom immunotherapy (VIT) include increased patient convenience and more rapid induction of clinical protection from future stings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Greater convenience</strong> &ndash; Inconvenience is the most common reason patients discontinue conventional immunotherapy. Accelerated schedules involve fewer office visits and are favored by many patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>More rapid onset of clinical benefit</strong> &ndash; Accelerated schedules induce the immunologic changes that occur during the build-up phase more rapidly than conventional schedules. Thus, patients achieve clinical protection sooner. In most patients, protection from recurrent systemic allergic reactions appears to be established within a week of reaching maintenance doses and may improve further with time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rush-and-ultra-rush-venom-immunotherapy-for-hymenoptera-allergy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In a study of the ultra-rush protocol mentioned above, two patients with severe past reactions were restung 7 to 15 days after desensitization and developed only local erythema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rush-and-ultra-rush-venom-immunotherapy-for-hymenoptera-allergy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In addition, significant increases in venom-specific immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) were noted 15 days after reaching maintenance. The immunologic changes induced by immunotherapy are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergen-immunotherapy-for-allergic-disease-therapeutic-mechanisms#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Allergen immunotherapy for allergic disease: Therapeutic mechanisms&quot;, section on '&quot;Blocking&quot; IgG4'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Reduced risk of dosing errors</strong> &ndash; Dosing errors are one of the leading causes of systemic allergic reactions during subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT). Accelerated schedules involve fewer doses during the build-up phase, and these doses are administered over a more concentrated time period, so dosing errors are reduced.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7152425\"><span class=\"h2\">Safety</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Accelerated VIT schedules were designed to be performed in the outpatient setting under the supervision of an experienced allergist and nursing staff. There are no data to suggest that patients should routinely be hospitalized to undergo accelerated VIT. However, patients should be screened appropriately before any form of SCIT is considered. (See <a href=\"#H7152475\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> below.)</p><p>Among the different Hymenoptera venoms, honey bee is the most likely to induce a systemic allergic reaction in both conventional and accelerated VIT schedules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rush-and-ultra-rush-venom-immunotherapy-for-hymenoptera-allergy/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. As an example, in a report of patients treated with a four-day rush protocol, systemic allergic reactions occurred in 12 percent of subjects receiving honey bee venom, compared with 2 percent of those receiving yellow jacket venom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rush-and-ultra-rush-venom-immunotherapy-for-hymenoptera-allergy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. No patients required <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5916092\"><span class=\"h3\">Rates of systemic allergic reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both rush and ultra-rush schedules for VIT usually demonstrate similar or lower rates of systemic allergic reactions during the build-up phase compared with conventional schedules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rush-and-ultra-rush-venom-immunotherapy-for-hymenoptera-allergy/abstract/4,7-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7-12</a>]. The specific rate depends upon the schedule used. We use a schedule that causes systemic reactions in less than 5 percent of people according to the original publication, although we rarely observe systemic reactions in our practice. This low rate of reactions has been attributed to the use of fewer injections and lower cumulative doses of venom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rush-and-ultra-rush-venom-immunotherapy-for-hymenoptera-allergy/abstract/9,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,13</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The relationship between systemic reactions, injection number, and cumulative venom dose was illustrated in a study in which three different accelerated VIT schedules were compared [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rush-and-ultra-rush-venom-immunotherapy-for-hymenoptera-allergy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Subjects underwent either a four-day, six-hour, or 210-minute schedule, and systemic reactions occurred in 28, 29, and 7 percent, respectively. The shorter schedules required fewer injections and lower cumulative doses of venom. Rates of systemic reactions with specific schedules are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H7152531\" class=\"local\">'Specific protocols'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another randomized study compared VIT using an ultra-rush protocol with a rush protocol and with a slow protocol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rush-and-ultra-rush-venom-immunotherapy-for-hymenoptera-allergy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Systemic reactions were observed in 1.9 percent, 3.7 percent, and 3.9 percent of patients, respectively, during the build-up phase and in 0.99, 1.46, and 2.7 percent, respectively, during the maintenance phase. Reactions to subsequent stings did not differ among groups (1.1 percent, 1.2 percent, and 1.1 percent).</p><p/><p>In contrast to the above, shorter schedules with fewer injections were associated with more systemic reactions in one well done study. Of note, this was an Australian study evaluating patients receiving immunotherapy for jack jumper ant hypersensitivity, which uses whole body extract rather than purified venom, so it is difficult to extrapolate the results to immunotherapy with purified venoms. Still, this study compared the incidence of systemic reactions between a 3-visit and 10-visit schedule of VIT in 93 subjects sensitive to jack jumper ant (<em>Myrmecia pilosula</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rush-and-ultra-rush-venom-immunotherapy-for-hymenoptera-allergy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Although the shorter schedule required fewer injections, it was associated with a higher rate of reactions (12 percent) compared with the slower schedule (no systemic reactions).</p><p>A study from Germany found that independent predictors of SR during rush VIT included female sex, receiving honeybee (versus other venoms), and use of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rush-and-ultra-rush-venom-immunotherapy-for-hymenoptera-allergy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7152468\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The indications for subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT) of any type are reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subcutaneous-immunotherapy-for-allergic-disease-indications-and-efficacy#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subcutaneous immunotherapy for allergic disease: Indications and efficacy&quot;, section on 'Indications'</a>.)</p><p>It is our approach to use accelerated schedules for venom immunotherapy (VIT) in preference to conventional schedules since protection from future stings can be achieved with no increase in treatment-related risk. VIT practice parameters state that safe and effective accelerated schedules have been published and are no longer considered experimental [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rush-and-ultra-rush-venom-immunotherapy-for-hymenoptera-allergy/abstract/8,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,17</a>].</p><p>Other specific indications for an accelerated VIT schedule include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A desire by the patient to minimize the number of visits for treatment, either because of the patient's schedule or the distance that the patient lives from the treatment facility.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The inability to tolerate conventional VIT. Occasionally, accelerated VIT is used to achieve maintenance in patients who do not tolerate conventional build-up due to recurrent systemic reactions in response to the injections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rush-and-ultra-rush-venom-immunotherapy-for-hymenoptera-allergy/abstract/3,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,12</a>].</p><p/><p>The literature describes the performance of accelerated VIT in children as young as two years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rush-and-ultra-rush-venom-immunotherapy-for-hymenoptera-allergy/abstract/13,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,18</a>]. In older children, maturity level and the ability to cooperate with the repeated injections required should be considered.</p><p>In theory, patients with mast cell disorders (eg, systemic mastocytosis or monoclonal mast cell activation syndrome) might tolerate accelerated VIT schedules better than traditional schedules, although this issue has not been formally studied.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24581499\"><span class=\"h2\">Cost</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cost of an accelerated protocol varies by the length of the procedure and number of injections given. Accelerated protocols involve fewer injections and less venom, but more staff contact time. At the authors' institution, the cost of accelerated and conventional VIT are similar.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7152475\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTRAINDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Contraindications to accelerated venom immunotherapy (VIT) are the same as those for conventional VIT, since the safety is comparable or better. Patients with asthma should have their symptoms under good control prior to beginning any form of subcutaneous immunotherapy (SCIT).</p><p>Relative contraindications include medical conditions that would impair the patient's ability to survive anaphylaxis or treatment for anaphylaxis (eg, cardiovascular disease and severe chronic pulmonary diseases). However, in patients with venom allergy, cardiopulmonary disorders also put the patient at risk for a fatal outcome from a future sting, so each patient's situation must be considered individually. These issues, as well as in the use of beta-blockers or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors in patients needing VIT, are discussed in more detail elsewhere.

Mild systemic reactions were observed in one and seven patients in the H1 and placebo groups, respectively. The addition of the H2 antihistamine did not provide additional protection. Local reactions were reduced in the groups receiving either H1 or combination premedication. Two other randomized trials reached similar conclusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rush-and-ultra-rush-venom-immunotherapy-for-hymenoptera-allergy/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. However, H1 antihistamines did not appear to prevent serious systemic reactions (eg, hypotension) in any of these studies, although the incidence of such reactions was low.</p><p>At least one study also suggested that antihistamine premedication improves the efficacy of VIT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rush-and-ultra-rush-venom-immunotherapy-for-hymenoptera-allergy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>The authors' practice is to begin accelerated VIT as soon as the diagnosis of venom allergy is made (ie, usually on the same day that the patient is skin tested) to avoid the risk of future stings. Whenever possible, we administer an H1 antihistamine prior to the start of the procedure. We typically give a second generation nonsedating agent, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cetirizine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cetirizine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loratadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">loratadine</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fexofenadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fexofenadine</a>, at standard age-appropriate doses. However, it is our experience that patients tolerate the accelerated schedule even without premedication. Thus, if it is practical to pretreat with an H1 antihistamine prior to starting the accelerated VIT schedule, then we suggest doing so because there may be some benefit as outlined in the above studies. However, this is not required in the practice parameters and should not otherwise delay administration of immunotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rush-and-ultra-rush-venom-immunotherapy-for-hymenoptera-allergy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>A more extensive premedication regimen (such as is used with accelerated aeroallergen immunotherapy) is unnecessary, based on the practice parameters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rush-and-ultra-rush-venom-immunotherapy-for-hymenoptera-allergy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], and further delays the administration of VIT.</p><p>The addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> and H2 antihistamines to H1 antihistamines appears to be more important for imported fire ant whole body extract (WBE) than for purified Hymenoptera venoms because the frequency of systemic reactions without premedication in patients receiving accelerated WBE immunotherapy is higher, at least based on one study of a one-day protocol. In that study, patients received either no premedication or three days of prednisone and H1 and H2 blockers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rush-and-ultra-rush-venom-immunotherapy-for-hymenoptera-allergy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

The composition of the immunotherapy prescription and preparation of the extracts for use in accelerated schedules are not typically different from what would be used for a traditional schedule. Only the dosing schedule is altered.</p><p>The protocols described here can be performed for one or more venoms. If a mixed vespid product is used, the volumes remain the same and each dose contains the corresponding micrograms of each of the three vespid venoms.</p><p>In our practice, we use a dosing schedule that achieves subtherapeutic but significant doses in one day. When patients initially present for evaluation of possible venom allergy, we suggest that they return for skin testing, and if results are positive, that they remain in the office for desensitization immediately after skin testing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7152559\"><span class=\"h2\">135 minutes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The authors use a one-day protocol that reaches a dose of 20 mcg in 135 minutes, with or without premedication (as previously discussed) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F70301\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70301 \">table 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rush-and-ultra-rush-venom-immunotherapy-for-hymenoptera-allergy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

All patients except one completed the ultra-rush desensitization. That patient stopped because of a hypertensive crisis unrelated to the immunotherapy. Seven percent had mild systemic reactions (generalized itching, dizziness without hemodynamic changes, malaise), which did not require <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> or discontinuation of the protocol.

The protocol involved administration of the following doses (in micrograms): 0.1, 1, 10, and 20 mcg at 30-minute intervals, followed by 30 mcg and 50 mcg at 60-minute intervals. Subjects then received 100 mcg on days 7 and 14, and monthly thereafter. The protocol was performed 78 times, and caused no hypersensitivity reactions in 83 percent of these. Systemic reactions developed in 17.5 percent, although none was severe enough to require <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>.

The protocol involved administration of the following doses (in micrograms): 0.01 mcg, 0.1 mcg, 1 mcg, 10 mcg, 20 mcg, 40 mcg, and 80 mcg at 60-minute intervals. On day 2, subjects received 100 mcg at 08:00 AM and at 11:00 AM. Systemic reactions were seen in 8.8 and 11 percent of bee-allergic and wasp-allergic subjects, respectively, which were lower than rates with more prolonged protocols.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2636947\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT OF ADVERSE REACTIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2636977\"><span class=\"h2\">Systemic reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systemic reactions to accelerated venom immunotherapy (VIT) are rare, and the best approach for continuing immunotherapy has not been formally studied. Empirically, there are two options for proceeding with treatment once the patients has been treated and returned to baseline:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Resume the accelerated schedule on the following day, which theoretically takes advantage of the patient's hyporesponsive state immediately after a systemic reaction</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Convert to a conventional schedule</p><p/><p>Since there are no studies evaluating either approach, the decision to try one approach over another requires a discussion between patient and clinician, and considerations of the patient's preferences.</p><p>As with conventional immunotherapy, patients who develop systemic reactions should be treated for anaphylaxis and observed for a period of time once symptoms have resolved. Patients with mild to moderate reactions that respond promptly and completely to treatment can usually be observed in the clinic for two hours and discharged to home. However, it may be more appropriate to hospitalize a patient with a more severe reaction or with symptoms that do not respond promptly to treatment. Likewise, patients who live far from medical care or have little home support may be better served by hospitalization. There is a risk of biphasic reactions with anaphylaxis from any cause and the risk factors for recurrent symptoms are unclear, although these have rarely been reported in the rush immunotherapy literature. Deciding on the best immediate aftercare for a patient with a systemic reaction obviously required clinical judgement. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biphasic-and-protracted-anaphylaxis#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Biphasic and protracted anaphylaxis&quot;, section on 'Possible risk factors'</a>.)</p><p>The patient should then return at the next scheduled day based on the individual protocol (most commonly in one week) to resume injections. The authors believe it important <strong>not </strong>to extend this time period by even a few days, as it is their observation that patients who wait longer than a week tend to experience more systemic reactions in the remaining build-up. The authors resume treatment with the dose that caused the reaction. There is no utility based on the available literature for continuing antihistamine medications during the maintenance phase of therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2636998\"><span class=\"h2\">Large local reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Local reactions at the site of the injections are seen in up to 20 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rush-and-ultra-rush-venom-immunotherapy-for-hymenoptera-allergy/abstract/4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6</a>]. Some patients find the injections themselves painful, similar to a mild sting. Large local reactions are treated symptomatically (eg, with ice and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>), as with conventional immunotherapy. We do not terminate rush or ultra-rush VIT for large local reactions, unless the patient is too uncomfortable to continue. In most cases, we wait a few minutes longer between injections to allow treatment to start taking effect, and then continue the protocol.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H509796800\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

The build-up phase is shortened by administering more injections per visit, increasing the dose more between consecutive injections, or both. (See <a href=\"#H7152382\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Accelerated protocols for venom immunotherapy (VIT) are categorized as either rush or ultra-rush schedules, although these terms are not strictly defined. Rush VIT schedules involve administering the build-up phase over two to three consecutive days until the maintenance dose is achieved (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F80931\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80931 \">table 3</a>). Ultra-rush VIT uses a more rapid one-day build-up phase, although the final dose on that day is usually lower than full maintenance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F62051\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62051 \">table 4</a>). In both cases, the patient returns to complete the remainder of the injections weekly, then biweekly, then monthly. (See <a href=\"#H7152382\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Advantages of accelerated VIT include increased patient convenience and more rapid induction of clinical protection from future stings. In most patients, protection from recurrent systemic allergic reactions appears to be established within a week of reaching maintenance doses. (See <a href=\"#H6515795\" class=\"local\">'Advantages'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rates of systemic allergic reactions with both rush and ultra-rush VIT are similar or lower than rates with conventional VIT. This has been attributed to the use of fewer injections and lower cumulative doses of venom during the build-up phase. The specific rate depends upon the schedule used. Accelerated VIT is performed in the outpatient setting. (See <a href=\"#H7152425\" class=\"local\">'Safety'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The indications and contraindications for accelerated VIT are the same as those for conventional VIT because the safety is similar. In addition, rush or ultra-rush VIT may be tolerated in patients who are having difficulty reaching maintenance with a conventional build-up schedule because of recurrent systemic reactions to the injections. (See <a href=\"#H7152468\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7152475\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest premedicating all patients with an H1 antihistamine before beginning an accelerated VIT protocol (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). We typically give a second generation nonsedating agent, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cetirizine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cetirizine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loratadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">loratadine</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fexofenadine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fexofenadine</a>, at standard age-appropriate doses. (See <a href=\"#H13281285\" class=\"local\">'Premedication'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several rush and ultra-rush VIT schedules have been published. The authors use a one-day protocol that reaches a dose of 20 mcg in 135 minutes, with or without premedication, with which they have not seen systemic reactions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F70301\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70301 \">table 5</a>). (See <a href=\"#H7152531\" class=\"local\">'Specific protocols'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large local reactions are treated symptomatically (eg, with ice and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>), as with conventional immunotherapy. In patients who do develop systemic reactions, we suggest discontinuing the accelerated protocol and converting the patient to a conventional build-up schedule (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
