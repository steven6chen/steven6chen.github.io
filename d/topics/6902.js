The contribution of each of these systems is outlined in the following sections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Skeletal muscle</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Skeletal muscles are organized in motor units, composed of between 10 and 2000 muscle fibers. Each motor unit is innervated by a single motor neuron. The muscle fibers within a given motor unit are classified as type I or type II based on features such as the oxidative or glycolytic enzyme content, contraction speed, myoglobin content, and myosin <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adenosine</a> triphosphatase content (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F62260\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62260 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-physiology/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. These features in turn influence the mechanical output of the muscle unit.</p><p>Type I (also called red or slow-twitch) fibers have a high content of the oxygen binding protein myoglobin, a high content of oxidative enzymes for producing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adenosine</a> triphosphate (ATP), and a high density of mitochondria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-physiology/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. These fibers tend to be fatigue resistant and are recruited for low-level endurance activity. The high myoglobin content in type I fibers provides a ready supply of oxygen for oxidative metabolism.</p><p>Type II (also called white or fast-twitch) fibers are further categorized as types IIA and IIX (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F62260\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62260 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-physiology/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Type IIA fibers are similar to type I in their myoglobin content and oxidative enzyme capacity. Type IIX fibers have a low content of myoglobin and high glycolytic capacity and are recruited for short-term, heavy work, particularly work above 70 percent of the muscle's aerobic capacity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-physiology/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Fiber type varies considerably among human muscles; as examples, the soleus consists predominantly of type I fibers, while the triceps is composed mainly of type II fibers, and the vastus lateralis muscle is approximately 50 percent type I. The fiber type mix within a given muscle varies among individuals and is genetically determined. Training can result in a greater capillary density, increased muscle fiber size, and an increased concentration of mitochondria within a fiber, along with the potential for alteration of the proportion of fiber types within a given muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-physiology/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H4034285\" class=\"local\">'Adaptations to training'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12518662\"><span class=\"h2\">Metabolism in skeletal muscles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Muscle contraction and relaxation depend primarily upon hydrolysis of ATP, which releases the chemical energy necessary for binding of the protein myosin with actin filaments to allow myosin to slide along the actin filament leading to mechanical contraction. Energy metabolism in muscle and the various metabolic myopathies are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=energy-metabolism-in-muscle\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Energy metabolism in muscle&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Energy sources</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main sources for energy to produce the ATP used by skeletal muscle during exercise are glycogen, glucose, and free fatty acids with glycogen being the predominant source of energy especially during short bouts of exercise. Protein is rarely used as an energy source, except during periods of starvation. The specific energy source used by working muscle for aerobic metabolism depends upon a number of factors including the intensity, type, and duration of exercise, and also physical conditioning and diet. </p><p>Glycogen, glucose, and free fatty acids all provide energy for the creation of ATP, although the amount of ATP generated depends on the metabolic pathway used. Hydrolysis of ATP by the enzyme actomyosin-ATPase permits actin-myosin cross-bridge formation and release, with resultant muscular contraction; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adenosine</a> diphosphate (ADP) and phosphate (PO4-) are released in the process. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21540806\"><span class=\"h3\">Metabolic pathways</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of biochemical processes in muscle fibers are responsible for maintaining a constant supply of ATP, as intracellular stores of the high-energy compound ATP are small and must be continually replenished. The three main energy producing pathways that are utilized to prevent significant decreases in ATP concentration during dynamic exercise are the phosphocreatine shuttle, oxidative phosphorylation, and glycolysis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12518000\"><span class=\"h4\">Phosphocreatine shuttle</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Upon initiation of exercise, the first energy &quot;buffer&quot; is the phosphocreatine (PCr) shuttle, whereby the enzyme creatine kinase splits a molecule of inorganic phosphate (Pi) from PCr, which then combines with ADP to yield ATP and creatine (Cr). The shuttle mechanism maintains the ATP concentration in the proximity of actin-myosin cross-bridging for short duration exertion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-physiology/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">PCr &#160;+ &#160;ADP &#160;&mdash;&gt; &#160;Cr &#160;+ &#160;ATP &#160;&lt;&mdash;&gt; &#160;ADP &#160;+ &#160;Pi</p></div></div><p/><p>When ATP is utilized for muscle contraction, ADP and PO4- are released. Skeletal muscle PCr concentration has been shown to decrease and recover with incremental exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-physiology/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Training and oral loading of carbohydrates or creatine improve PCr kinetics and exercise performance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-physiology/abstract/5,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7,8</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H4034271\" class=\"local\">'Metabolic system'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12518138\"><span class=\"h4\">Oxidative phosphorylation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most efficient skeletal muscle ATP source is the oxidative phosphorylation of intracellular glycogen and free fatty acids (FFA) in the muscle mitochondrion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F67253\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67253 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F82039\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82039 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-physiology/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In the initial steps, pyruvate is produced during the metabolism of glycogen, glucose, or FFA and then converted to acetyl coenzyme A (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81164\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81164 \">figure 3</a>). Acetyl coenzyme A enters the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (also known as the citric acid cycle or Krebs cycle) with resultant generation of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FADH<sub>2</sub>). Oxidative phosphorylation occurs when NADH and FADH2 donate electrons to generate approximately 26 molecules of ATP per molecule of pyruvate.</p><p>TCA cycle flux in exercising skeletal muscle increases up to 100-fold during strenuous exercise, with associated fivefold increases in TCA cycle intermediates, known as the intermediate pool [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-physiology/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Endurance training has been associated with TCA intermediate pool expansion at the start of exercise and may contribute to improved energy provision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-physiology/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Circulating levels of TCA cycle intermediates have been shown to increase rapidly in response to exercise and proportionately to intramuscular changes, with greater excursions in plasma TCA Span 2 intermediates tracking with higher fitness levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-physiology/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Whether TCA intermediate pool expansion is necessary to support increased flux, thereby rendering the reactions that refill the TCA cycle critical to TCA cycle function, or whether TCA intermediate pool expansion is simply a pyruvate sink reflecting glycolytic pyruvate production exceeding the rate of oxidation in the TCA cycle, remains controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-physiology/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>With more prolonged exercise that depletes the skeletal muscle supplies of carbohydrate and FFA, blood borne glucose, FFA, and gluconeogenic amino acids (eg, branched chain) become additional sources of energy. The &quot;gluconeogenic&quot; amino acids can be metabolized to alpha keto acids, and then to glucose, and thereby contribute to ATP production during prolonged exercise, especially when muscle glycogen is depleted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-physiology/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The disadvantage of using amino acids as an energy source is that they are derived from muscle protein, and protein catabolism eventually leads to loss of muscle strength.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12518130\"><span class=\"h4\">Glycolysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glycolysis is a rapid source of ATP production in which pyruvate derived from glycolysis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81164\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81164 \">figure 3</a>) is converted to lactate without oxygen, yielding two molecules of ATP. However, glycolysis is less efficient than oxidative phosphorylation as it produces much less ATP than the approximately 26 that are produced by oxidative phosphorylation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-physiology/abstract/2,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,14</a>]. </p><p>The action of adenylate kinase yields the two <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adenosine</a> diphosphate molecules needed for the reaction:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Glucose &#160;+ &#160;2Pi &#160;+ &#160;2ADP &#160;&lt;&mdash;&gt; &#160;2 Lactate &#160;+ &#160;2H<sub>2</sub>O &#160;+ &#160;2ATP </p></div></div><p/><p>Glycolysis results in faster production of ATP than oxidative metabolism but cannot be sustained due to a rapid drop in muscle cytoplasmic pH, which inhibits further glycolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-physiology/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Once excess lactic acid is moved extracellularly to the blood, it is buffered by bicarbonate, thus producing additional CO<sub>2</sub> (in excess of O<sub>2</sub> consumption). Lactate is then transported to the liver and nonexercising muscle where it is converted to pyruvate, which in turn is metabolized to glucose. </p><p>Glycolysis is an important ATP source when the capacity of pyruvate dehydrogenase to metabolize pyruvate through the TCA cycle is exceeded and pyruvate is oxidized via mass action to lactate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-physiology/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. These conditions are fostered by the rapid glycogenolysis associated with elevated plasma catecholamines during heavy, brief exercise and when there is an imbalance between mitochondrial oxygen supply and demand during ischemic and hypoxic exercise or at the onset of intense exercise.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Circulatory system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An essential role of the circulatory system during exercise is to deliver oxygen to the muscles and take proton equivalents away from the muscle to the lungs. This task is accomplished by increases in heart rate and stroke volume, and decreases in systemic and pulmonary vascular resistance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4034846\"><span class=\"h3\">Fick Principle</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The delivery of oxygen to the muscles by the circulatory system (VO<sub>2</sub>) is expressed in a rearrangement of the Fick equation:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">VO<sub>2</sub> &#160;= &#160;Qt &#160;x &#160;(CaO<sub>2</sub> &#160;- &#160;CvO<sub>2</sub>)</p></div></div><p/><p>In this equation, Qt is the cardiac output (product of heart rate times stroke volume) and (CaO<sub>2</sub> - CvO<sub>2</sub>) is the systemic oxygen extraction or the difference in O<sub>2</sub> content between arterial and mixed venous blood (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F56651\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56651 \">figure 4</a>). Increased muscle activity during exercise results in increased oxygen extraction in the peripheral circulation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxygen-delivery-and-consumption#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oxygen delivery and consumption&quot;, section on 'Definitions'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=functional-exercise-testing-ventilatory-gas-analysis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Functional exercise testing: Ventilatory gas analysis&quot;, section on 'Aerobic parameters'</a>.)</p><p>The arteriovenous oxygen difference is calculated by the following equation:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">(CaO<sub>2</sub> &#160;- &#160;CvO<sub>2</sub>) &#160;= &#160;1.34 &#160;&times; &#160;hemoglobin concentration &#160;&times; &#160;(arterial oxygen saturation &#160;&ndash; &#160;mixed venous oxygen saturation) </p></div></div><p/><p>Maximal cardiac output, which facilitates transport of oxygen from the alveolus to skeletal muscle, determines the maximal oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2</sub> max) and aerobic capacity to a large degree. Maintenance of CaO<sub>2</sub> and depression of CvO<sub>2</sub> during exercise are also circulatory functions, requiring exquisite matching of blood flow to ventilation and tissue metabolism, respectively.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Cardiac output</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cardiac output increases during incremental exercise through changes in both heart rate (HR) and stroke volume (SV). The relative increments in each component of cardiac output (HR, SV) and C(a-v)O<sub>2</sub> that permit an increase in VO<sub>2</sub> during exercise are illustrated in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F95312\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef95312 \">figure 5</a>). In healthy adults, cardiac output is generally the limiting factor in the VO<sub>2</sub> max. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Maximal heart rate</strong> &ndash; The maximal HR decreases as a function of age, as predicted by the following equation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-physiology/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]:</p><p/><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p class=\"bulletIndent3\">Maximal HR &#160;= &#160;220 &#160;- &#160;age (in years)</p></div></div><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, a meta-analysis of 18,712 subjects found that this equation underestimates the maximal heart rate in older subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-physiology/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The following equation was more accurate for predicting maximal HR in healthy adults:</p><p/><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"> &#160; Maximal HR &#160;= &#160;208 &#160;- &#160;0.7 &#160;x &#160;age (in years)</p></div></div><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Normally, the difference between achieved and maximal predicted HR (called the heart rate reserve) is less than 15 beats per minute [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-physiology/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The rise in HR is linear versus VO<sub>2</sub>, initially due to withdrawal of vagal tone, and subsequently due to increased sympathetic activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-physiology/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The maximal HR also appears directly related to lean body mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-physiology/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Thus, the malnourished or myopathic patient may have a reduced heart rate (versus the normal individual) at peak exercise. Training results in a lower HR at rest and at any given VO<sub>2</sub> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F77997\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77997 \">figure 6</a>), but does not affect maximal HR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-physiology/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

The rise in<strong> </strong>SV during exercise is mediated in part by increased contractility, reflected by an increase in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of approximately 10 percent from rest to peak exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-physiology/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. LV filling is enhanced during exercise by capacitance venoconstriction, greater negative intrathoracic pressures, and the pumping action of exercising limbs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-physiology/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. As a result, left ventricular end-diastolic volume (LVEDV) also increases by 20 to 40 percent, augmenting SV by the Frank-Starling mechanism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-physiology/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-left-ventricular-pressure-volume-and-other-hemodynamic-relationships\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of heart failure: Left ventricular pressure-volume and other hemodynamic relationships&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In a heart with normal relaxation (lusitropic) properties, LV end-diastolic pressure increases to approximately 20 mmHg during maximum exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-physiology/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Diastolic filling is limited by the physical constraints of the pericardium, as evidenced by the increase in maximum cardiac output and VO<sub>2</sub> following pericardiectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-physiology/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Maximum cardiac output</strong> &ndash; Cardiac output normally increases by approximately 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> for every 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> increase in VO<sub>2</sub> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-physiology/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. This slope is not altered by training, but maximum cardiac output improves with conditioning to four to five times resting values (up to levels of approximately 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span> in a young healthy individual). Maximum cardiac outputs above 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span> have been reported in elite athletes, and elite athletes may exhaust their breathing reserve before attaining maximal cardiac output [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-physiology/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Abnormal cardiovascular reserve function</strong> &ndash; Exercise-induced elevations in left sided filling pressures (ie, exercise PCWP &gt;17 to 19 mmHg) can unmask heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-physiology/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Cardiac contractility may be relatively preserved at rest in HFpEF, despite dramatic limitations in the ability to augment systolic and vascular function with the stress of exercise. This is termed abnormal cardiovascular reserve function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-physiology/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Abnormal endothelium-dependent vasodilation contributes importantly to vascular stiffening and to abnormal flow-dependent vasodilation with exercise; aortic stiffness has also been related to abnormal exercise capacity in HFpEF patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-physiology/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. HFpEF patients also fail to augment heart rate normally during maximum exercise (ie, chronotropic incompetence) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-physiology/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>], though the impact of heart-rate modulation with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ivabradine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ivabradine</a> on peak VO<sub>2</sub> in HFpEF was divergent in two small trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-physiology/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In a small cohort of patients with HFpEF, exercise capacity was markedly reduced, and this was related to an inability to increase cardiac output by enhancing preload (end diastolic volume) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-physiology/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Subsequent invasive hemodynamic studies suggest that elevated left-sided filling pressures compromise exercise capacity through a reduction in cardiac output [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-physiology/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Pulmonary arterial wedge pressure normally increases about 1.4 mmHg for every 1 mmHg increase in right atrial pressure, suggesting interdependence of right and left ventricular filling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-physiology/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. In summary, there are multiple pathophysiologic mechanisms that can lead to impaired cardiac reserve capacity and that may help to subphenotype disease states such as HFpEF.

The rise in mean systemic BP with exertion is normally much less than the increment in cardiac output, reflecting a decrease in systemic vascular resistance (SVR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-physiology/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

The development of peripheral fatigue depends upon the intensity and duration of exercise and is influenced by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Accumulation of metabolic byproducts</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depletion of high-energy phosphates</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depletion of glycogen substrate</p><p/><p>During brief, intense exercise, skeletal muscle intracellular pH decreases because of the accumulation of cytosolic lactate and loss of potassium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-physiology/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>]. Increased concentration of hydrogen ion in the myocyte may contribute to fatigue through inhibition of glucosyl flux and muscle contraction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-physiology/abstract/71,99\" class=\"abstract_t\">71,99</a>]. With acute exercise to exhaustion, for example, the intracellular lactate concentration can exceed 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> and the pH may fall below 6.40 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-physiology/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>].</p><p>Ammonia, generated from deamination of AMP to inosine monophosphate in the stressed type II muscle fiber, has also been implicated in peripheral fatigue, possibly via inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-physiology/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]. Training is associated with relatively less ammonia and lactate in muscle and blood during exercise and with less fatigue at a given metabolic rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-physiology/abstract/97,102\" class=\"abstract_t\">97,102</a>].</p><p>Depletion of high-energy phosphate compounds also probably plays a role in peripheral fatigue with short-term exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-physiology/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Evidence for the importance of this phenomenon is provided by patients with McArdle's disease, who are incapable of producing significant quantities of lactate but who fatigue quickly during exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-physiology/abstract/103\" class=\"abstract_t\">103</a>]. In contrast, fatigue during endurance events appears related to the depletion of glycogen stores rather than high-energy phosphates. This is thought to be responsible for the phenomenon of the marathon runner &quot;hitting the wall.&quot; Muscle metabolism rarely is the critical factor in determining maximal exercise tolerance, but it may affect an individual's ability to sustain high levels of exertion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-physiology/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>].

The improvements in muscle and cardiorespiratory function with endurance training increase the maximal oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2</sub> max) and the lactate threshold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-physiology/abstract/104,105\" class=\"abstract_t\">104,105</a>]. Thus, the endurance trained individual can perform at higher rates of work than an untrained person.

The type of training (eg, prolonged endurance or resistance) affects the type of muscular adaptations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-physiology/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Endurance training leads to mitochondrial biogenesis, fast-to-slow fiber transformation, expansion of the muscle capillary bed, and changes in substrate metabolism. Resistance training typically increases the size of muscle fibers, which leads to the ability to exert more force [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-physiology/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Prolonged and high-intensity exercise has been shown to increase strength and the cross sectional area of ligaments and tendons. In general, women and men of all ages show gains in strength from resistance training, although the degree of adaptation to training varies from one individual to another [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exercise-physiology/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>].

This is accomplished by increases in minute ventilation, cardiac output, and systemic oxygen extraction along with microvascular adaptations that increase the delivery of oxygen to the muscles. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Human skeletal muscles are composed of type I (also called red or slow twitch) fibers and type II (also called white or fast twitch) fibers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F62260\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62260 \">table 1</a>). Type II fibers are further categorized as types IIA and IIX. For each individual, the relative proportion of fiber types influences the capacity for the particular type of exercise (eg, low-level endurance, rapid heavy work). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Skeletal muscle'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The main energy sources used by skeletal muscles during exercise are glycogen, glucose, and free fatty acids. Protein is rarely used as an energy source, except during periods of starvation. These substrates provide the chemical energy to create <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adenosine</a> triphosphate (ATP), which is used for myosin cross-linking to actin. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Energy sources'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Upon initiation of exercise, the most immediate source of energy is the phosphocreatine (PCr) shuttle, in which the enzyme creatine kinase splits a phosphate molecule off PCr, and the phosphate molecule then combines with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adenosine</a> diphosphate to make ATP. ATP is then immediately available to myosin for contraction. (See <a href=\"#H12518000\" class=\"local\">'Phosphocreatine shuttle'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most efficient source of ATP comes from metabolism glucose and glycogen to pyruvate by glycolysis followed by metabolism of pyruvate via the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle (also known as the citric acid cycle or Krebs cycle) in the mitochondria. During low-level exercise, the majority of muscle metabolism is aerobic, meaning that there is adequate oxygen to metabolize pyruvate by oxidative phosphorylation which provides the maximum amount of ATP. Alternatively, fatty acids or, rarely, protein are metabolized to acetic acid and enter the TCA cycle. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Energy sources'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12518138\" class=\"local\">'Oxidative phosphorylation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With progressively increasing muscular work, the capacity of pyruvate dehydrogenase to metabolize pyruvate is exceeded, and glycolysis becomes the source of ATP (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F82039\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82039 \">figure 2</a>). This point is known as the lactate threshold (LT), or the level of oxygen uptake in the lungs (VO<sub>2</sub>) at which a sustained rise in blood lactate occurs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F78425\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78425 \">figure 11</a>). Glycolysis metabolizes pyruvate to lactate with a lower yield of ATP than the TCA cycle. (See <a href=\"#H21540806\" class=\"local\">'Metabolic pathways'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ventilatory threshold is defined as the point at which the minute ventilation (VE) increases out of proportion to the VO<sub>2</sub> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52387\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52387 \">figure 8</a>) and occurs at approximately the same time as the patient approaches the lactate threshold (LT). Thus, the ventilatory threshold is sometimes used as a noninvasive marker of the LT. (See <a href=\"#H20431871\" class=\"local\">'Lactate threshold'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12518329\" class=\"local\">'Ventilatory threshold'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The maximal cardiac output normally sets the limit on aerobic exercise capacity, although endurance training typically leads to increased cardiac output. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Circulatory system'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The maximum oxygen uptake (VO<sub>2</sub> max) reflects the maximal ability of a person to take in, transport, and use oxygen, and it defines that person's functional aerobic capacity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F64164\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64164 \">figure 10</a>). The VO<sub>2</sub> max has become the &quot;gold standard&quot; laboratory measure of cardiorespiratory fitness and is the most important parameter measured during functional exercise testing. (See <a href=\"#H21539941\" class=\"local\">'Assessment of exercise capacity'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The LT occurs at above 40 percent of the predicted VO<sub>2</sub> max in normal individuals. In comparison, LT occurs earlier (at a lower percent of VO<sub>2</sub> max) in the course of exercise among patients with cardiovascular disease, but later (at a higher percent of VO<sub>2</sub> max) in endurance trained athletes. (See <a href=\"#H12518353\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above and <a href=\"#H20431871\" class=\"local\">'Lactate threshold'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Training enhances virtually every step of exercise gas exchange from the lung to the skeletal muscle mitochondrion. Endurance training leads to mitochondrial biogenesis, fast-to-slow fiber transformation, changes in substrate metabolism, expansion of the muscle capillary bed, and increased cardiac output. Resistance training typically increases the size and protein content of muscle fibers, which leads to the ability to exert more force.
