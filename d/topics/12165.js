Some couples seek this information even before attempting pregnancy or meeting criteria for subfertility. These couples are especially motivated to listen to advice concerning the impact of lifestyle factors on fertility, as well as their general health.</p><p>Epidemiologic studies suggest that some lifestyle factors have small, cumulative effects that prolong the duration of time before achieving pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optimizing-natural-fertility-in-couples-planning-pregnancy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Conversely, modifications of these factors appear to improve fertility potential, although this has not been evaluated by randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optimizing-natural-fertility-in-couples-planning-pregnancy/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].</p><p>The impact of lifestyle on fertility, and the implications of these findings for a couple planning pregnancy, will be reviewed here. The evaluation and treatment of subfertile couples are discussed separately.

Infertility refers to a state in which the capacity for fertility is diminished, but not necessarily absent. For this reason, the term <strong>subfertility</strong> is often used instead of infertility. <strong>Sterility</strong> is the inability to produce offspring.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fecundability</strong> is the probability of achieving a pregnancy in a single menstrual cycle. <strong>Subfecundity</strong> is a decrease in fecundability.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Time to pregnancy</strong> refers to the length of time, usually measured in months, that it takes a couple to conceive. This parameter is often used in epidemiological studies as a measure of subfecundity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optimizing-natural-fertility-in-couples-planning-pregnancy/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">What is normal natural fertility?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most pregnancies occur during the first six menstrual cycles of attempted conception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optimizing-natural-fertility-in-couples-planning-pregnancy/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]; fecundability decreases as the number of consecutive months without achieving pregnancy increases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80057\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80057 \">figure 1</a>). In the first six months of attempting pregnancy, approximately 80 percent of couples will conceive; in the first 12 months, approximately 85 percent will conceive. Over the next 36 months, approximately 50 percent of remaining couples will go on to conceive spontaneously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optimizing-natural-fertility-in-couples-planning-pregnancy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The 5 to 7 percent of couples who have not conceived after 48 months of attempted conception will only occasionally go on to achieve a spontaneous conception. </p><p>Criteria for initiating an infertility evaluation vary depending on personal characteristics (eg, age) and are discussed separately.

The duration of the fertile period is not affected by age, but can vary among women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optimizing-natural-fertility-in-couples-planning-pregnancy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The highest probability of conception occurs when intercourse takes place one to two days prior to ovulation and on the day of ovulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optimizing-natural-fertility-in-couples-planning-pregnancy/abstract/9,11-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11-16</a>]. Women can attempt to predict the time of ovulation by tracking changes in cervical mucus (highest probability of conception is on the day of peak production of slippery clear mucus) or by using a kit to measure urinary luteinizing hormone (LH). Use of a home ovulation test kit may decrease the time to conception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optimizing-natural-fertility-in-couples-planning-pregnancy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], particularly in women with irregular cycles or couples who have sexual intercourse infrequently. However, for most women, there is no substantial evidence that self-monitoring to predict ovulation increases cycle fecundability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optimizing-natural-fertility-in-couples-planning-pregnancy/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].

Most data indicate that optimum semen quality, measured in terms of motility, morphology, and total sperm count, occurs when there are two to three days of ejaculatory abstinence; longer intervals are associated with lower pregnancy rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optimizing-natural-fertility-in-couples-planning-pregnancy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1745902358\"><span class=\"h3\">Effect of lubricants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some lubricants inhibit sperm motility in vitro (eg, KY jelly, Astroglide, Touch, Replens, olive oil, saliva, KY Sensitive, KY Warming, KY Tingling) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optimizing-natural-fertility-in-couples-planning-pregnancy/abstract/25-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-30</a>]; however, a secondary analysis of couples in a prospective time-to-pregnancy study found no difference in fecundability between those who used and did not use lubricants (primarily Astroglide, KY Jelly, or Pre-seed) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optimizing-natural-fertility-in-couples-planning-pregnancy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Although there are no compelling data to suggest that lubricant use impairs fertility, the use of lubricants that do not inhibit sperm motility, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mineral-oil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mineral oil</a>, canola oil, mustard oil, or hydroxyethylcellulose-base (Pre-Seed), is prudent when lubricants are needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H604595535\"><span class=\"h3\">Coital factors that do not affect fertility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Coital position, presence or absence of female orgasm, and female position (eg, remaining supine) after male ejaculation do not appear to affect the likelihood of conception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optimizing-natural-fertility-in-couples-planning-pregnancy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">How does age affect fertility?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Delayed childbearing can decrease the probability of successful conception, and should be taken into account in family and career planning. Women in their late 30s are about 40 percent less fertile than women in their early 20s. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=effects-of-advanced-maternal-age-on-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Effects of advanced maternal age on pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The probability of conception is highly dependent upon maternal age, but paternal age also plays a minor role, especially after age 50 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optimizing-natural-fertility-in-couples-planning-pregnancy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. In a large well-designed study, the probability of clinical pregnancy following intercourse on the most fertile day of the cycle in women of assumed fertility aged 19 to 26 years, 27 to 34 years, and 35 to 39 years was about 50, 40, and 30 percent, respectively, if the male partner was the same age, but 45, 40, and 15 percent, respectively, if he was five years older [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optimizing-natural-fertility-in-couples-planning-pregnancy/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

Most studies are observational and subject to many potential biases. As an example, numerous investigators have reported that primary tubal infertility is increased in women who report a history of many sexual partners, an earlier age at first intercourse, and cigarette smoking. However, women with more sexual partners and an earlier age at first intercourse may also be more likely to smoke cigarettes; thus, it is often difficult to definitively determine if cigarette smoking is an independent contributor to infertility or whether cigarette smoking is largely associated with infertility through other exposures, such as sexually transmitted infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optimizing-natural-fertility-in-couples-planning-pregnancy/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. In addition, women who smoke cigarettes tend to consume more alcohol and caffeine than women who do not smoke. This raises the possibility that the relationship between cigarette smoking and reduced fertility may influence observations of an association between alcohol and caffeine consumption and diminished fertility.</p><p>In many of the studies discussed below, attempts were made to control for some of the potential confounding interactions through the use of logistic regression and multivariate analyses. However, the absence of data from randomized trials is a major weakness of the evidence in this area. An additional limitation is that there is no biomarker that can be measured to indicate the potential for human conception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optimizing-natural-fertility-in-couples-planning-pregnancy/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Tobacco use</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Use of tobacco by the female partner, and possibly by the male partner, has been associated with subfertility, and may account for as much as 13 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optimizing-natural-fertility-in-couples-planning-pregnancy/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Observational studies suggest that much of the subfertility associated with smoking can be reversed within a year of cessation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optimizing-natural-fertility-in-couples-planning-pregnancy/abstract/38-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-41</a>]. </p><p>Given the multiple health risks associated with cigarette smoking, cessation should be encouraged irrespective of fertility and pregnancy issues. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benefits-and-risks-of-smoking-cessation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benefits and risks of smoking cessation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-smoking-cessation-management-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of smoking cessation management in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H647595133\"><span class=\"h3\">Female partner</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies of the impact of smoking on fertility have typically analyzed the effects of &quot;cigarettes smoked per day&quot; on fecundability. Most series report that fecundability is decreased if the female partner smokes more than 10 cigarettes per day. In a 1998 meta-analysis including data from almost 11,000 smoking women and over 19,000 nonsmokers, cigarette smoking by the female partner was associated with a statistically significant increase in infertility compared to nonsmokers (OR 1.60, 95% CI 1.34-1.91) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optimizing-natural-fertility-in-couples-planning-pregnancy/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Although only observational studies were included, the evidence was compelling because of the consistency of the effect across different study designs, sample sizes, and types of outcome. Others have reported that the time to achieve pregnancy increases with the number of cigarettes smoked per day (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F74093\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74093 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optimizing-natural-fertility-in-couples-planning-pregnancy/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>An additional concern is that subfertility in smokers cannot necessarily be overcome by assisted reproductive technology (ART). The same 1998 meta-analysis found that the odds of pregnancy per number of in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles was significantly lower in smokers compared to nonsmokers (OR 0.66, 95% CI 0.49-0.88) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optimizing-natural-fertility-in-couples-planning-pregnancy/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>Possible mechanisms for subfertility in smokers include adverse tubal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cervical changes, damage to gametes, and increase in spontaneous abortion and ectopic pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optimizing-natural-fertility-in-couples-planning-pregnancy/abstract/35,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,44</a>]. Numerous studies linking smoking to early menopause suggest that cigarette smoking causes premature depletion of the ovarian pool of oocytes and premature aging of the ovary by one to four years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optimizing-natural-fertility-in-couples-planning-pregnancy/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]; this decrease in ovarian reserve can account for the subfertility observed in smokers. </p><p>Components of cigarette smoke may cause oxidative stress and DNA damage to the ovarian follicle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optimizing-natural-fertility-in-couples-planning-pregnancy/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. For this reason, smoking by a pregnant woman may be harmful to the ovaries of her fetus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optimizing-natural-fertility-in-couples-planning-pregnancy/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. In a study of the effect of in-utero exposure to cigarette smoke on the fertility of the female partner, fecundability was reduced among women exposed to cigarette smoke in-utero (fecundability ratio 0.5, 95% CI 0.4-0.8) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optimizing-natural-fertility-in-couples-planning-pregnancy/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. This association was present after adjusting for age of the female partner, frequency of intercourse, current smoking status, age at menarche, childhood exposure to cigarette smoke, body mass of the female partner, alcohol and caffeine consumption, educational level, and reproductive history. There may also be adverse reproductive effects of maternal smoking on male fetuses. An epidemiologic study reported that adult male offspring of mothers who smoked more than 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">cigarettes/day</span> during pregnancy had lower sperm counts than the sons of nonsmokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optimizing-natural-fertility-in-couples-planning-pregnancy/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H647595140\"><span class=\"h3\">Male partner</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dose-dependent decreases in semen quality have been observed in men who smoke, but available evidence does not prove that smoking decreases male fertility. An analysis of 27 epidemiologic studies addressing the effect of smoking on sperm concentration, motility, and morphology in fertile and infertile men found a modest reduction in semen quality and altered hormone levels among smokers compared to nonsmokers, but did not find a reduction in male fertility associated with paternal smoking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optimizing-natural-fertility-in-couples-planning-pregnancy/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Fertile male smokers had a 23 percent decrease in sperm concentration and a 13 percent decrease in sperm motility compared to fertile male nonsmokers. </p><p>A deleterious effect on male fertility or a secondary deleterious effect on female fertility cannot be definitively excluded, especially among men with marginal semen quality. Studies in subfertile populations that evaluated the effect of smoking by the male partner on the success rate of IVF and intracytoplasmic sperm injection have reported a significant decrease in the number of pregnancies achieved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optimizing-natural-fertility-in-couples-planning-pregnancy/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Overweight and obesity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Obese and underweight women are at risk of subfertility, as well as other adverse effects on health.

A cross-sectional study in the United States reported that adolescents who self-reported being obese (BMI &gt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> were more than twice as likely to remain childless than normal-weight adolescents after adjusting for confounding variables such as adult BMI, nongestational amenorrhea, marital status, ethnicity, geographical location, and socioeconomic status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optimizing-natural-fertility-in-couples-planning-pregnancy/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Most studies in adults report a BMI greater than 27 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> or a BMI less than 17 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> is associated with increased ovulatory dysfunction and resultant infertility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optimizing-natural-fertility-in-couples-planning-pregnancy/abstract/57-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">57-59</a>]. Even in regularly ovulating women, increasing obesity appears to be associated with decreasing spontaneous pregnancy rates and increased time to pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optimizing-natural-fertility-in-couples-planning-pregnancy/abstract/60-62\" class=\"abstract_t\">60-62</a>]. In addition to absolute body weight, weight gain in adulthood may also increase the amount of time needed to conceive, irrespective of baseline weight or menstrual cyclicity. As an example, a prospective cohort study of nearly 2000 women reported that every 5 kg body weight increase (from the patient's baseline weight at age 18) was associated with a 5 percent increase in the mean duration of time needed for attempted conception (95% CI 3 to 7 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optimizing-natural-fertility-in-couples-planning-pregnancy/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Of note, approximately 90 percent of the women in this study had regular menstrual cycles which suggests that altered ovulation was not the mechanism. Therefore, women who wish to conceive are counseled about the importance of achieving and maintaining a normal weight. </p><p>Prior observational studies have reported both nonsurgical [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optimizing-natural-fertility-in-couples-planning-pregnancy/abstract/64-66\" class=\"abstract_t\">64-66</a>] and surgical [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optimizing-natural-fertility-in-couples-planning-pregnancy/abstract/67-73\" class=\"abstract_t\">67-73</a>] weight loss increased the frequency of ovulation and natural conception. However, weight reduction does not appear to be associated with increased fecundability. A large, multicenter trial of obese (BMI &ge;29 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> and infertile women reported no difference in birth rates of term singletons or overall live birth rates among women who received a six-month structured weight-loss intervention prior to infertility treatment and control women who went directly to infertility treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optimizing-natural-fertility-in-couples-planning-pregnancy/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. There were also no differences in the obstetric outcomes of gestational diabetes or hypertensive disorders of pregnancy between intervention and control groups. In the trial, women in the intervention group were more likely to conceive spontaneously (26 versus 16 percent) and underwent fewer fertility treatment cycles (679 versus 1067 treatment cycles) compared with the control women. Study limitations include that target weight loss was reached by only 38 percent of women in the intervention group and the intervention discontinuation rate was 22 percent. It is not known if greater weight reduction per person, increased proportion of women reaching target weight loss, or increased patient continuation rates would increase fecundability. </p><p>We continue to advise weight loss for infertile women with an elevated BMI because weight reduction aids in spontaneous conception in some studies and reduces the need for fertility treatment, in addition to providing long-term benefits for overall health [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optimizing-natural-fertility-in-couples-planning-pregnancy/abstract/64,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,66</a>]. In a study of 67 women who had an average weight loss of 10 kg over six months, spontaneous ovulatory cycles resumed in nearly 90 percent (60 of 67), with 52 women becoming pregnant and 45 having a live birth. None of the control patients, consisting of study drop-outs, resumed ovulatory cycles or conceived. One lifestyle modification to achieve weight loss includes increased moderate physical activity, such as walking 150 minutes weekly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optimizing-natural-fertility-in-couples-planning-pregnancy/abstract/75,76\" class=\"abstract_t\">75,76</a>]. Dietary intake should be decreased by 500 to 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">cal/day,</span> which will result in a 1 to 2 pound weekly weight loss. Consuming a low-calorie diet of 1000 to 2000 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/day</span> should result in a 10 percent decrease in BMI over six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optimizing-natural-fertility-in-couples-planning-pregnancy/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. Maintaining a 10 percent weight loss with lifestyle modification is uncommon and only achieved by 20 percent after one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optimizing-natural-fertility-in-couples-planning-pregnancy/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. Those participating in a lifestyle moderation program may have an improved chance of maintaining weight reduction as compared with those not in a structural program [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optimizing-natural-fertility-in-couples-planning-pregnancy/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obesity-in-adults-overview-of-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obesity in adults: Overview of management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For women with an elevated BMI, subfertility appears to be related to insulin resistance leading to insulin excess [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optimizing-natural-fertility-in-couples-planning-pregnancy/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. Hyperinsulinemia may lead to androgen excess by reducing sex hormone-binding globulin synthesis, thereby increasing free testosterone, and by stimulating ovarian androgen production rates. Excess androgen, in turn, is a major factor leading to altered hypothalamic-pituitary and ovarian physiology and anovulation. Obesity-associated hyperleptinemia may be an additional factor involved in anovulation, not only through the induction of insulin resistance, but also through direct impairment of ovarian function. Factors other than anovulation also likely play a role in obesity-related subfertility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optimizing-natural-fertility-in-couples-planning-pregnancy/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of polycystic ovary syndrome in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The association between low BMI and infertility is also related to ovulatory dysfunction, although the mechanism differs from that in obese women. Underweight women, particularly those who exercise excessively <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> have low calorie intake, may have hypothalamic amenorrhea. In these women, suppression of pulsatile gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion from the hypothalamus results in decreased secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) and therefore loss of ovarian cyclicity and estrogen deficiency. Changes in leptin may also be involved. The cohort study above also reported that women who were underweight at age 18 (BMI less than 18.5) had a 25 percent increase in duration of attempted conception compared with women of normal weight. The majority of women in both groups reported regular menses. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=functional-hypothalamic-amenorrhea-pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Functional hypothalamic amenorrhea: Pathophysiology and clinical manifestations&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eating-disorders-overview-of-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Eating disorders: Overview of epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Underweight infertile women may benefit from weight gain, which may improve the frequency of ovulation and therefore the likelihood of pregnancy. As an example, a study of 26 infertile women with a mean BMI of 19.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> employed counseling by a dietitian and clinician-directed advice to increase BMI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optimizing-natural-fertility-in-couples-planning-pregnancy/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. These women gained a mean 3.7 kg and 73 percent conceived after these interventions.

There is consistent evidence that obesity affects reproductive hormone levels, but studies have reported conflicting results on the effect of obesity on semen parameters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optimizing-natural-fertility-in-couples-planning-pregnancy/abstract/86-89\" class=\"abstract_t\">86-89</a>].

The risk of unsuccessful in vitro fertilization (IVF) increases with increasing body mass index (BMI) and may be related to poor oocyte quality, ovarian function, endometrial quality, or a combination of these factors. In a systematic review and meta-analysis including 33 studies and almost 48,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">IVF/intracytoplasmic</span> sperm injection (ICSI) treatment cycles, women who were overweight or obese (BMI <span class=\"nowrap\">&ge;25kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> had a statistically significant small reduction in clinical pregnancy rate (RR = 0.90) and live-birth rate (RR = 0.84) and a significantly higher miscarriage rate (RR = 1.31) than normal weight women (BMI <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;25kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optimizing-natural-fertility-in-couples-planning-pregnancy/abstract/97\" class=\"abstract_t\">97</a>]. </p><p>Studies have reported poor oocyte quality in obese women, and some, but not all, studies have reported decreased fertilization rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optimizing-natural-fertility-in-couples-planning-pregnancy/abstract/98-102\" class=\"abstract_t\">98-102</a>].

This study suggests obesity may impair endometrial receptivity. Although obesity is associated with decreased chances of pregnancy in women undergoing IVF with autologous oocytes, a systematic review of IVF outcomes in obese women who received donor oocytes did not observe significant negative effects of obesity on outcome compared with nonobese donor oocyte recipients (clinical pregnancy RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.83-1.16) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optimizing-natural-fertility-in-couples-planning-pregnancy/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>]. This suggests that obesity-mediated subfertility is related, at least in part, to egg quality and perhaps endometrial receptivity. It is also possible that endometrial preparation and monitoring in donor oocyte IVF cycles, which differs from that in fresh autologous cycles, alter some of the adverse effects related to obesity.</p><p>However, methodologic problems concerning patient selection, inadequate description of cases, retrospective scientific design, and lack of information on important confounding factors (eg, male partner obesity, smoking habits, fat distribution, or associated pathologies) have prevented clear conclusions or consensus on the effects of obesity on fertility and therapy of subfertility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optimizing-natural-fertility-in-couples-planning-pregnancy/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H64615218\"><span class=\"h3\">Spontaneous abortion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most studies report an increased spontaneous abortion (SAB) rate in obese women undergoing ART [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/optimizing-natural-fertility-in-couples-planning-pregnancy/abstract/96,97,99,101,106-110\" class=\"abstract_t\">96,97,99,101,106-110</a>].
