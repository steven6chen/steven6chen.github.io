Severely malnourished children are often identified when brought to medical attention for an acute issue such as diarrhea or fever, but should also be sought through community-wide screenings of vulnerable children in high-risk settings. In some cases SAM is precipitated by political disruptions like war or natural disasters like drought, which interfere with the food supply. However, more often SAM is simply a disease of pervasive poverty and poor hygienic conditions, compounded by seasonal shortages of food and spikes in illnesses such as malaria or infectious diarrhea. </p><p>This topic review will discuss treatment of children with SAM <strong>with complications</strong> such as intercurrent infections. Affected children are treated as inpatients in hospitals or feeding centers, using protocols promoted by the World Health Organization (WHO). In the past, this approach was used for most children with SAM. However, experience over the last 15 to 20 years has demonstrated that children with <strong>uncomplicated</strong> SAM, constituting the vast majority of malnourished children, can and should be treated at home with support from outpatient feeding programs. This community-based management of acute malnutrition (CMAM) approach appears to produce equal or better recovery and case fatality rates, to widen population coverage, and has been successfully implemented worldwide by governments and relief organizations. As a result, CMAM has become the international standard of care for uncomplicated cases of severe malnutrition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-complicated-severe-acute-malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].

Although the principles of treatment of malnourished children from resource-rich countries are similar to those from resource-limited countries, the specific details may vary based on local customs and resources. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=failure-to-thrive-undernutrition-in-children-younger-than-two-years-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Failure to thrive (undernutrition) in children younger than two years: Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H875429829\"><span class=\"h2\">Children 6 through 59 months old</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Severe acute malnutrition (SAM) can occur in people of all ages but has its highest incidence and is best studied in children between 6 and 59 months of age. Therefore, protocols for diagnosis and triage focus on this age group, as outlined in the following sections. </p><p>World Health Organization (WHO) international growth standards should be used to identify and classify the degree of acute malnutrition in developmentally normal children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-complicated-severe-acute-malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. These criteria are based upon the degree of wasting and the presence of edema, where wasting is identified by measuring mid-upper-arm circumference (MUAC) or determining the weight-for-height Z-score (WHZ). Children should be classified based on whichever criterion is most significantly abnormal; for example, if a child is moderately malnourished by MUAC but severely malnourished by WHZ, the child should be classified as severely malnourished. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries-clinical-assessment#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Malnutrition in children in resource-limited countries: Clinical assessment&quot;, section on 'Clinical assessment'</a>.)</p><p>The diagnostic criteria for acute malnutrition are (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60869\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60869 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Moderate acute malnutrition (MAM)</strong>: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>MUAC 11.5 to 12.4 cm (115 to 124 mm), <strong>or </strong></p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>WHZ -2 to -3 (ie, weight-for-length between 2 and 3 standard deviations [SD] below the median)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Severe acute malnutrition (SAM)</strong>:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>MUAC &lt;11.5 cm (&lt;115 mm), <strong>or</strong> </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>WHZ &lt;-3 (ie, weight-for-length more than 3 SD below the median), <strong>or</strong></p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Bilateral pitting edema</p><p/><p>The presence of bilateral pitting edema is diagnostic of kwashiorkor (edematous malnutrition). Such edema begins in the most gravitationally dependent areas of the body and is classified as 1<sup>+</sup> if in the feet and lower legs only, 2<sup>+</sup> if it extends to the upper body or arms, or 3<sup>+</sup> if it extends to the face. Due to the profound physiological perturbations associated with kwashiorkor, children with any degree of symmetric pitting edema should be considered severely malnourished, regardless of WHZ or MUAC. </p><p>Most children with acute malnutrition also have evidence of stunting (impaired linear growth), which indicates chronic malnutrition. Moderate stunting is defined by height or length-for-age Z-score between -2 and -3. Management of acute malnutrition is similar regardless of whether there is underlying chronic malnutrition, although obviously the most stunted children will have the highest risk of failing to respond to therapy, for relapse, and for mortality. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H729654771\"><span class=\"h2\">Other age groups</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal diagnostic criteria and nutritional therapy for children outside of the typical 6 to 59 month age range are less well-defined: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Infants 0 through 6 months</strong> &ndash; For infants under six months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-complicated-severe-acute-malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>], MUAC less than 11.0 cm is likely the best single criterion for diagnosing SAM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-complicated-severe-acute-malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The threshold for admitting these infants to inpatient care is necessarily lower than for older children. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Triage'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Children 5 years and older</strong> &ndash; For children five years of age and older, anthropometric standards to define acute malnutrition in this age group have not been clearly defined, but it is reasonable to use body mass index (BMI)-for-age Z-score criteria to define severe wasting. Using <a href=\"http://www.who.int/growthref/who2007_bmi_for_age/en/&amp;token=CGrU2PnO7/NB7T04m20ugJgpqfG6FaG35vpYuSe0SDPPwcvl3DXJWrIsPwbB5XCh7233+MDKsEG21yoK3aAU+w==&amp;TOPIC_ID=5901\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">BMI-for-age charts from the WHO</a>, &quot;thinness&quot; (corresponding to moderate malnutrition) is defined as a Z-score &lt;-2 SD, and severe thinness (corresponding to severe malnutrition) is &lt;-3 SD. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although malnutrition is less common in this age group compared with younger children, it occasionally occurs, particularly in times of displacement or significant food insecurity. Severe malnutrition in these children necessitates a search for a severe underlying infection. In endemic areas, older children with kwashiorkor often have tuberculosis as their underlying diagnosis, while those with marasmus may be infected with tuberculosis or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or both. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">TRIAGE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children between 6 and 59 months of age with severe malnutrition (marasmus <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> kwashiorkor) should be referred to a treatment center for a thorough clinical assessment to identify any medical complications. The first step is immediate assessment and attention to respiratory distress, altered mental status, dehydration, and other danger signs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-complicated-severe-acute-malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] </p><p>The treatment setting, nutritional intervention, and other medical management depends on the presence or absence of complications (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F113987\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef113987 \">algorithm 1</a>): </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Uncomplicated SAM</strong> &ndash; The vast majority of children will have uncomplicated severe acute malnutrition (SAM), characterized by a good appetite and no significant clinically evident medical complications; these children usually should be treated as outpatients in a supervised community-based feeding program, with regular follow-up. Their management is discussed in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-uncomplicated-severe-acute-malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of uncomplicated severe acute malnutrition in children in resource-limited countries&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Complicated SAM</strong> &ndash; A small minority of children with severe malnutrition will have complicated SAM, characterized by medical complications such as sepsis, diarrhea with severe dehydration, significant skin breakdown with open ulceration, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a poor appetite. These children should generally be hospitalized and receive specific therapies for their acute illness while nutritional rehabilitation is initiated. The appetite is determined by an &quot;appetite test&quot; wherein they demonstrate an ability to successfully eat a moderate amount of ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) under direct supervision; from a practical standpoint this is the most useful criterion in determining whether a child can be treated at home. (See <a href=\"#H3251363142\" class=\"local\">'RUTF appetite test'</a> below.). </p><p/><p>Other children who may need to be hospitalized include (but are not limited to) those who have not recovered after a trial of outpatient therapy, those with untreated human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or tuberculosis infection that need to initiate definitive therapy, and those with challenging social situations (eg, those with challenges in accessing an outpatient therapeutic site reliably or those without caretakers able to provide frequent supervised feedings at home) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-complicated-severe-acute-malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]. </p><p>For infants six months and younger, the threshold for admission to inpatient care is necessarily lower than for older children, especially if the inpatient center can offer intensive counseling and assistance in resuming exclusive breastfeeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-complicated-severe-acute-malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Although specific clinical trial evidence is lacking, the general approach to treatment is to provide closely supervised feedings with commercial infant formula or dilute F-100, with attempts at reinstituting or optimizing exclusive breastfeeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-complicated-severe-acute-malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

The approach is based upon the altered nutritional physiology of the malnourished child (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77579%7EPEDS%2F54640%7EPEDS%2F62304\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77579 graphicRef54640 graphicRef62304 \">table 2A-C</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-complicated-severe-acute-malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>] and has evolved over decades of trial-and-error to become an international standard of care endorsed by the World Health Organization (WHO) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-complicated-severe-acute-malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>]. Most of these recommendations reflect common practice and expert opinion and are not informed by randomized trial evidence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-complicated-severe-acute-malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Initial stabilization</strong> &ndash; The initial phase is a critical time with an emphasis on the acute recognition and treatment of life-threatening conditions, especially hypoglycemia, hypothermia, dehydration, and infection. Feedings are begun immediately and advanced as the rehabilitation phase begins. Modern therapeutic feeding products generally contain all necessary electrolytes and vitamins to correct most deficiencies and do not require specific supplementation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Rehabilitation</strong> &ndash; With the advent and widespread availability of ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF), the inpatient rehabilitation phase has been dramatically shortened for most children. Malnourished children usually can be discharged home within a week of admission, once steady weight gain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> decreasing edema is observed, to complete rehabilitation with close outpatient follow-up. During the inpatient rehabilitation phase, the child's caretaker is trained to continue care at home and any social problems are addressed. Emotional stimulation and sensory development of the child extends throughout the initial and rehabilitation phases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Follow-up</strong> &ndash; In the follow-up phase, the physical, mental, and emotional development of the child are monitored after discharge.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL STABILIZATION PHASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial stabilization phase is a critical time that emphasizes treatment of life-threatening conditions, including hypoglycemia, hypothermia, dehydration, and infection.</p><p>Treatment priorities include respiratory support, temperature control (warming), empiric antibiotics for infection, and rehydration. Feedings are begun in this period as soon as clinically safe. They are advanced as the child's appetite returns, which typically occurs during the first few days of refeeding.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4161709031\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypoglycemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypoglycemia and hypothermia may occur with fasting of four to six hours duration in a malnourished child, or can be precipitated by a serious systemic infection. These conditions may be associated with apnea. These disorders usually respond to early and frequent feedings and temperature control. Blood glucose levels should be checked if any concerning clinical signs are present, including hypothermia, apnea, anorexia, listlessness, or lethargy. Treatment for hypoglycemia should be initiated if the blood glucose is less than 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> (54 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-complicated-severe-acute-malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/8,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,15</a>], as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the child is conscious, administer 50 mL of 10 percent glucose or sucrose solution (eg, one rounded teaspoon of sugar in three tablespoons of water) orally or by nasogastric tube, followed by feeding as soon as possible.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the child is unconscious, administer 10 percent dextrose or glucose solution, 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> intravenously (IV; or by nasogastric tube if IV access is not possible). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If oral, IV, or nasogastric administration is not possible, administer sublingually one teaspoon of sugar moistened with 1 to 2 drops of water, taking care to avoid aspiration. Repeat every 20 minutes to avoid relapse. </p><p/><p>Hypokalemia and other electrolyte deficiencies often occur among severely malnourished children. However, specific serum measurements are rarely available in resource-limited settings. Moreover, specific supplementation generally is not necessary because Rehydration Solution for Malnutrition (ReSoMal) and the therapeutic feeding products used for treatment of malnutrition will correct most, if not all, of these deficiencies gradually and safely. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypothermia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the body temperature is &lt;35.5 degrees C (96 degrees F), the child should be warmed. This can be accomplished using a warm blanket or with an incandescent lamp directed on, but not touching, the child's body. If these options are not available, the child can be warmed by close contact with the mother's body. Hypothermia may be a sign of sepsis, or may be caused by fasting.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Infection</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4039363873\"><span class=\"h3\">Empiric antibiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All malnourished children in inpatient care should be treated empirically with a course of broad-spectrum antibiotics, as many children with severe malnutrition have systemic infections, including bacteremia, urinary tract infections, and pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-complicated-severe-acute-malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/1,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,16,17</a>], often without classic clinical signs such as fever, tachycardia, or tachypnea. If resources are available, blood and urine cultures should be obtained to guide optimal management, but treatment should not be delayed while awaiting results. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Rationale for empiric treatment</strong> &ndash; Formal studies are limited but have shown survival benefits seen when antibiotics are empirically included in the treatment regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-complicated-severe-acute-malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. Moreover, empiric treatment is appropriate in malnourished children because of the high rates of underlying infections. In addition, clinical symptoms and signs of infection are often absent in this population: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Children with respiratory infections may present with tachypnea, retractions, and other signs of respiratory distress, but these are unreliable signs in malnourished children; their absence, as well as a normal chest radiograph or ultrasound, do not exclude the possibility of a significant respiratory infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Septic shock may be difficult to distinguish from dehydration and these conditions may coexist in the severely malnourished child, especially if diarrhea is present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-complicated-severe-acute-malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Helpful distinguishing clinical features include weak or absent pulses, which are likely to occur in septic shock rather than dehydration (although cold hands and feet may occur in either condition); and thirst; and sunken eyes and fontanel, which are characteristic of dehydration and do not occur in sepsis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63299\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63299 \">table 3</a>). However, typical signs of dehydration (eg, lack of moisture of the mouth and poor skin elasticity) are not reliable in severely malnourished children. Moreover, assessment of perfusion also may be particularly difficult in patients with edema due to kwashiorkor. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries-clinical-assessment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Malnutrition in children in resource-limited countries: Clinical assessment&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Antibiotic selection</strong> &ndash; In our practice, we use the following approach for all hospitalized patients with SAM, unless microbiologic data are available to guide antibiotic selection:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We generally begin all hospitalized children on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ampicillin</a> (50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IM or IV every six hours) plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">gentamicin</a> (7.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IM or IV once daily) for a total of 7 to 10 days. For children who appear particularly ill or are in areas with high rates of antibiotic resistance, we use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ceftriaxone</a> (50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> intramuscular injection <span class=\"nowrap\">[IM]/IV</span> once daily), instead of ampicillin and gentamicin. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For those children presenting with prolonged diarrhea, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">metronidazole</a> (10 to 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> orally every eight hours) is added as well. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For those children who recover quickly and are able to be discharged home before their parenteral antibiotic course is completed, the antibiotic regimen can be transitioned to oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">amoxicillin</a> (40 to 45 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> orally every 12 hours), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-and-clavulanate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">amoxicillin-clavulanate</a>, or a third-generation cephalosporin to complete at least one week of antibiotics. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>However, if children remain hospitalized, even those with signs of apparent clinical recovery, we continue broad-spectrum parenteral antibiotics for at least 7 to 10 days, due to the high rates of bacterial infection in children with complicated SAM.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">This approach is more aggressive and systematic than empiric antibiotic selection that has been traditionally recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for initial treatment of children with SAM. The WHO regimen consists of a five-day course of parenteral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ampicillin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">gentamicin</a> for patients with complicated malnutrition (with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chloramphenicol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">chloramphenicol</a> for nonresponders); or oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> for those with uncomplicated malnutrition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-complicated-severe-acute-malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/9,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,21</a>]. However, this WHO protocol has not been updated in nearly 20 years and does not reflect the global rise in antibiotic resistance, the spread of HIV, the increasing availability of newer antibiotics, and the increasing acuity of those children that require inpatient treatment (as most children can now be treated in the community). Therefore, we feel that a more intensive antibiotic regimen is warranted for children who are hospitalized with complicated malnutrition in the current era. Prospective trials are ongoing to help define optimal treatment regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-complicated-severe-acute-malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2452654128\"><span class=\"h3\">HIV infection and antiretrovirals</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For children with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection who are not already treated with antiretroviral drugs (ARV), these drugs should be started as soon as possible after stabilization of metabolic complications and sepsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-complicated-severe-acute-malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

It consists of the standard WHO ORS that has been modified by decreasing sodium and increasing potassium, magnesium, zinc, and copper concentrations to account for the common electrolyte derangements in SAM that may be exacerbated by standard ORS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53739\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53739 \">table 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-complicated-severe-acute-malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Standard ORS contains too much sodium and too little potassium for a typical child with malnutrition; it should generally be reserved for those who also have cholera (or profuse watery diarrhea suggestive of cholera in the appropriate epidemiologic context) in addition to SAM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-complicated-severe-acute-malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24548121\"><span class=\"h3\">Rehydration methods</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the child is able to drink, the ReSoMal solution is given by mouth. The required amount can be given as sips or by spoon every few minutes. However, malnourished children are weak and quickly become exhausted, so they may not take enough fluid voluntarily. If this occurs, the solution should be given slowly by nasogastric tube. </p><p>If adequate rehydration cannot be achieved through oral or nasogastric administration of ReSoMal alone, IV or subcutaneous fluids may be given. Half-strength Darrow's solution with 5 percent glucose is preferred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-complicated-severe-acute-malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/1,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9</a>]; the half-strength solution is created by diluting full-strength Darrow's solution (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51000\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51000 \">table 7</a>) with an equal amount of 5 percent dextrose in water (D5W). It is also acceptable to use Lactated Ringer's solution with 5 percent glucose; or half-normal saline supplemented with sterile <a href=\"topic.htm?path=potassium-chloride-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">potassium chloride</a>, 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span>. </p><p>Hydration via the IV route should be approached cautiously, since children with malnutrition are at risk for overhydration and heart failure. The initial bolus should be no more than 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> over one hour. If there are signs of improvement (decrease in pulse and respiration rates), then a second bolus of 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> may be given if the child is still unable to take this volume by mouth. Malnourished children receiving IV hydration should be monitored closely for signs of overhydration or heart failure; for example, any time the child's respiratory rate or heart rate increase or do not decrease while receiving fluids, this should raise alarm. If the child does not improve after the first bolus, he or she may be suffering from shock rather than dehydration.

This amount should be given over the course of 12 hours, starting with 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> every 30 minutes for the first two hours, and then 5 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per hour. This rate is slower than the rate of rehydration for children without severe malnutrition.</p><p>The child should be assessed at least hourly. The volume administered depends upon the amount the child will drink, the volume of ongoing losses in stool <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> emesis, and any signs of overhydration, especially heart failure. Rehydration should be stopped if an increase in respiratory <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pulse rates, engorgement of the jugular veins, increased liver size, or increasing edema (eg, puffy eyelids) occurs.</p><p>It may be difficult to know exactly when rehydration is complete, but signs may include when the child no longer is thirsty, produces urine, has improved skin turgor, and when mental status improves. Bedside ultrasound is also useful in assessing hydration status, comparing the ratio of the inferior vena cava with the descending aorta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-complicated-severe-acute-malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. </p><p>Once rehydration is complete, fluids given to maintain hydration should be based upon the child's willingness to drink and the amount of ongoing losses in the stool. As a guide, children younger than two years of age should be given 50 to 100 mL (between one-fourth and one-half of a large cup) of ReSoMal after each loose stool, and older children should receive 100 to 200 mL after each loose stool.

F-75 is given at a daily dose of 80 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/kg</span> (approximately 100 to 135 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg),</span> divided into frequent small feedings every two to three hours. The formula is fed in small amounts and at frequent intervals because intestinal motility and gastric acid production are decreased in severe malnutrition (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77579%7EPEDS%2F54640%7EPEDS%2F62304\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77579 graphicRef54640 graphicRef62304 \">table 2A-C</a>). </p><p>Infants can be fed orally using a cup and spoon; a dropper or syringe can be used in weaker infants. As a last resort, feeding may need to be given by nasogastric tube if the child has impaired consciousness or has vomiting, tachypnea, or painful stomatitis. For infants who are breastfed, continued breastfeeding should be encouraged during the refeeding phase, with supplements of expressed breastmilk or F-75.</p><p>Additional micronutrient supplementation beyond what is already contained in F-75, F-100, and RUTF formulations is rarely necessary, as these formulations contain all necessary vitamins and minerals needed to safely correct nearly all deficiencies, including the very common iron, phosphorus, zinc, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-a-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">vitamin A</a> deficiencies.

The clinician should not wait for weight gain or resolution of edema before advancing feeds because such improvements may not occur on F-75 feeds, although some overall clinical improvement can be expected. As the child's appetite improves, feedings are advanced to either F-100 formula or ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF), as tolerated. The child should be fed at least five times daily during the rehabilitation phase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-complicated-severe-acute-malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>], regardless of what type of food is used.

The most common form of RUTF is a peanut-based soft puree (paste) that is readily consumed by most infants six months and older, typically provided in sachets of 500 kcals (92 g) each (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F82277\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82277 \">table 9</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F114599\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef114599 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-complicated-severe-acute-malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

If the child successfully feeds on F-100, the RUTF appetite test should be repeated daily and feeds should be transitioned to RUTF as soon as the child passes the appetite test. </p><p>In settings where RUTF is not available and rehabilitation must be completed using F-100, a transition to traditional home diets can begin while the child is still hospitalized. This is done by gradually reducing and then stopping F-100 while adding or increasing the mixed diet until the child is eating a diet similar to what will be eaten at home.</p><p>The approaches described above are best established for children 6 through 59 months of age. For older children, specific therapeutic feeding regimens have not been clearly defined, but it is reasonable to use the protocols used for younger children, including rapid advancement to the standard RUTF as tolerated.

As examples, staff may be insufficient or inadequately trained, scales may be inaccurate, feedings may be incorrectly prepared, the risk of nosocomial infection is high, and the child's caretakers are often burdened with many round-the-clock nursing tasks that they are unprepared to manage for prolonged periods. Moreover, even with optimal hospital care, many children will not make an optimal recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-complicated-severe-acute-malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. This is part of the rationale to advance feedings to RUTF and discharge children home as soon as possible to complete their recovery at home.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insufficient nutrition &ndash; Patients may fail to respond because they are fed insufficient food or have a vitamin or mineral deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-complicated-severe-acute-malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Malabsorption of nutrients or rumination may contribute to lack of improvement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection &ndash; Children who fail to respond to nutritional treatment should be investigated for infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-complicated-severe-acute-malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Malnutrition leads to increased susceptibility to infection because nutritional deficiency results in immunosuppression and often occurs in the setting of a home environment with poor sanitation. The most frequent infections include diarrhea, dysentery (with hematochezia), pneumonia, urinary tract infection, otitis media, skin infections, and tuberculosis. In endemic settings tuberculosis, notably, can have its first and only manifestation as severe malnutrition, without the classic localized pulmonary or lymph node disease. Other infections include intestinal helminths, malaria, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=persistent-diarrhea-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Persistent diarrhea in children in resource-limited countries&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Undiagnosed medical conditions &ndash; Children may fail to respond to treatment because they have a serious underlying condition. Malnutrition may result from a variety of conditions including unrecognized congenital abnormalities, inborn errors of metabolism, malignancies, immunological diseases, and other diseases of the major organs.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Review of rehabilitation failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Optimal practices should result in a case-fatality rate of less than 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-complicated-severe-acute-malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. To assess and optimize clinical practice at a health care facility, it is important to keep accurate records of all children who fail to respond to treatment and of all deaths. Data should include the child's age, sex, date of admission, weight-for-height (or length) on admission, principal diagnoses, and treatment. If the child died, the date and time of death and apparent cause should be noted. These records should be reviewed periodically to identify areas for improvement. The timing of treatment failure or death can be helpful. As an example, deaths that occur within the first two days often are caused by hypoglycemia, unrecognized or mismanaged septic shock, or serious infection, whereas deaths that occur later often are caused by heart failure related to improper fluid management. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h1\">COGNITIVE AND FAMILY REHABILITATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Severe malnutrition can result in delayed mental and behavioral development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-complicated-severe-acute-malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. This delay likely is caused by significantly reduced brain growth, as reflected in reduced head circumference in malnourished compared with well-nourished children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-complicated-severe-acute-malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The effect on cognition and behavior is the most serious long-term result of malnutrition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2009703849\"><span class=\"h2\">Environmental stimulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Play programs that provide emotional and physical stimulation should start during rehabilitation and continue after discharge. These programs may reduce the risk of the child having some permanent intellectual disability and emotional impairment, although the direct evidence for this is relatively lacking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-complicated-severe-acute-malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/36,37,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37,39</a>].</p><p>Sensory deprivation should be avoided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-complicated-severe-acute-malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The child should be able to see and hear what is happening around him or her, and the face should not be covered. The child should never be restrained unless there is a risk of self-harm (eg, by pulling out a nasogastric&nbsp;tube or intravenous [IV] cannula). The mother or an alternate caregiver should stay with the child in the hospital and during rehabilitation. She should be encouraged to feed, hold, comfort, and play with her child as much as possible.</p><p>Children undergoing treatment for malnutrition should receive care in a cheerful environment. Toys should be available that are appropriate for the child's age and level of development. Play with other children is an important component of rehabilitation. Mothers should be encouraged to participate and can be trained to supervise play sessions.</p><p>Physical activity should be encouraged to promote the development of essential motor skills and enhance growth. Patients who are unable to move may benefit from passive motion of the limbs. As the child's nutritional status and general condition improve, the duration and intensity of physical activities should increase.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Parent education</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Parents should receive education regarding the causes of malnutrition and its prevention. Breastfeeding is a particularly important and practical measure to prevent malnutrition, so all mothers should be educated to exclusively breastfeed infants for the first six months and to continue breastfeeding for at least the first two years of life. Parents should also be given education about an appropriate diet and sanitary feeding techniques, strategies to stimulate the child's mental and emotional development, and other parenting skills. Teaching should begin well before discharge. The mother should spend as much time as possible at the nutrition rehabilitation center with her child and should provide care, including food preparation, for her child under supervision. She should be taught how to treat or obtain treatment for diarrhea and other infections, and to understand the importance of regular treatment for intestinal parasites.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h1\">DISCHARGE PHASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During rehabilitation, preparations should be made to ensure that the child is fully reintegrated into the family and community after discharge. The family must be prepared to prevent recurrence of severe malnutrition. If possible, the home should be evaluated by a social worker or nurse before discharge to ensure an adequate environment. If the child is abandoned or conditions at the home are unsuitable, a foster home should be sought [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-complicated-severe-acute-malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87026751\"><span class=\"h2\">Transfer to outpatient care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Where quality outpatient care for malnutrition is available, children should be transferred from inpatient to outpatient care when medical complications including edema are resolving, appears clinically well, and has a good appetite for ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-complicated-severe-acute-malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The target intake for RUTF is 150 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/kg/day,</span> and the child should be consistently taking at least 75 percent of this target before discharge. In the past, criteria for transfer to outpatient care depended on specific anthropometric variables [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-complicated-severe-acute-malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries/abstract/29,40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,40,41</a>], but these standards are no longer needed where specialized outpatient care for severe malnutrition is available. </p><p>For infants younger than six months, it is reasonable to transfer to outpatient care when weight gain on exclusive breastfeeding or replacement feeding is satisfactory (eg, weight gain more than 3 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/day</span> for at least three days), and the caregiver is linked with needed community-based outpatient care.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial assessment of a child with severe acute malnutrition (SAM) begins with identification of those with clinical complications that require inpatient care and urgent attention to acutely life-threatening conditions such as hypoglycemia, hypothermia, and dehydration, and the detection and treatment of infection. Dehydration may be difficult to distinguish from septic shock in a malnourished child (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63299\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63299 \">table 3</a>). For children 6 through 59 months of age, initial management depends upon the presence or absence of complications, and appetite (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F113987\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef113987 \">algorithm 1</a>):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Uncomplicated SAM &ndash; Children without clinical complications and with a good appetite can be treated as outpatients with ready-to-use therapeutic food (RUTF); management of this group is discussed in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-uncomplicated-severe-acute-malnutrition-in-children-in-resource-limited-countries\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of uncomplicated severe acute malnutrition in children in resource-limited countries&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Complicated SAM &ndash; Children with one or more of complications or with a poor appetite should be treated initially in an inpatient setting to permit management of the complications, rehydration, treatment with empiric intravenous (IV) antibiotics, and initiation of feeds. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Triage'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For all children with complicated SAM managed in resource-limited settings, we suggest empiric treatment with a course of broad-spectrum antibiotics, rather than no antibiotics or symptom-based treatment (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Empiric antibiotic therapy is warranted because of the high rates of underlying infections in severely malnourished children and because clinical symptoms and signs of infection are often absent. In our practice, we treat with a 7- to 10-day course of antibiotics, which are given intravenously in hospitalized patients, and transitioned to oral antibiotics when the patient is transferred to outpatient care. (See <a href=\"#H4039363873\" class=\"local\">'Empiric antibiotics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children with SAM who are treated as inpatients often require rehydration, which is accomplished with oral rather than IV rehydration when possible to reduce the risk of overhydration and heart failure. The optimal solution for initial rehydration is Rehydration Solution for Malnutrition (ReSoMal), which is based on the standard World Health Organization (WHO) rehydration oral solution that has been modified by decreasing sodium and increasing potassium concentrations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53739\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53739 \">table 5</a>). A total fluid volume of as much as 70 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> body weight may be needed during the first 12 hours of treatment. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Dehydration'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'ReSoMal'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After emergency conditions are treated, feedings should be initiated. The first step is to perform an appetite test with RUTF (see <a href=\"#H3251363142\" class=\"local\">'RUTF appetite test'</a> above). If the child does not pass the appetite test, feedings should begin using F-75 formula at a dose of 80 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/kg/day</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74062\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74062 \">table 8</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F113988\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef113988 \">algorithm 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H24548133\" class=\"local\">'Initial nutrition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As the child improves, feedings are advanced to either F-100 formula or RUTF as tolerated. The child should be fed at least five times daily, and goals for intake are approximately 175 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/kg/day</span>. For most children, we suggest advancement of feeds to RUTF as soon as the child passes the RUTF appetite test (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Rapid advancement to RUTF allows for faster discharge, thereby reducing the risk of nosocomial infection, conserving health care resources and decreasing the likelihood that the caretaker will take the child home (or even abandon the child) before therapy is complete. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Rehabilitation phase'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Where quality outpatient care for malnutrition is available, children should be transferred from inpatient to outpatient care when medical complications including edema are resolving, the child has a good appetite for RUTF, and appears clinically well.
