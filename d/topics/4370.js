The importance of adherence with lipid-altering medications in patients with dyslipidemia was demonstrated in a post-hoc analysis of data from the West of Scotland Coronary Prevention Study (WOSCOPS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-to-lipid-altering-medications-and-recommended-lifestyle-changes/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In this primary prevention study of men with hypercholesterolemia, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pravastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pravastatin</a> therapy was shown to decrease cardiovascular morbidity and mortality (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F59494\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59494 \">figure 1</a>). </p><p>The mean adherence for the entire group was 70 percent. Those patients in the treatment group with more than 75 percent adherence had the following benefits:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fewer definite coronary events (risk reduction of 38 versus 31 percent compared with patients treated with placebo)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lower cardiovascular mortality (risk reduction of 37 versus 32 percent)</p><p/><p>This dose-response effect associated with better adherence argues for improving medication adherence to maximize therapeutic response. Other benefits of adherence to drug therapy may include decreased utilization of medical services, better quality of life, and reduced social costs such as lost productivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-to-lipid-altering-medications-and-recommended-lifestyle-changes/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>In addition, since the risk factors for coronary heart disease (eg, lipid abnormalities, smoking, sedentary lifestyle, hypertension, diabetes mellitus) tend to be additive, nonadherence to medical or behavioral treatment of any individual risk factor results in a higher level of risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-to-lipid-altering-medications-and-recommended-lifestyle-changes/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Furthermore, nonadherence to one part of the medical regimen may increase the likelihood of nonadherence to other components.</p><p>The American Heart Association expert panel on compliance has reviewed existing adherence-enhancing strategies found effective in clinical research and has made recommendations involving patient education, contracts, self-monitoring, tailoring interventions to individual needs, telephone follow-ups, and social support [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-to-lipid-altering-medications-and-recommended-lifestyle-changes/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Anxiety may be associated with the negative interpretation of side effects and greater somatic sensitivity to symptoms and side effects, both of which may lead to avoidance of medical treatment and caregivers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-to-lipid-altering-medications-and-recommended-lifestyle-changes/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].

In a study of 585 patients hospitalized for an acute myocardial infarction and randomized to a case management intervention with frequent follow-up or usual medical care, the case management approach resulted in the following benefits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-to-lipid-altering-medications-and-recommended-lifestyle-changes/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased smoking cessation rate at two month follow-up (70 versus 50 percent, p = 0.03)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased plasma LDL cholesterol levels at two months (107 versus 132 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [2.77 versus 3.41 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L],</span> p = 0.001)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Improved functional capacity at six months (9.3 versus 8.4 METS, p = 0.001)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECIFIC FACTORS AFFECTING ADHERENCE TO LIPID-ALTERING MEDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prescribed medications may be refused or taken in other than the prescribed regimen for a variety of reasons.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Side effects of medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although statins are first-line, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering medications for the primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease, adverse effects are often reported by patients. For example, statin-associated muscle symptoms have a prevalence of 7 to 29 percent in registries and observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-to-lipid-altering-medications-and-recommended-lifestyle-changes/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].

As an example, a cohort study found that nonadherence to statins and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers increased with the complexity of the treatment regimen and prescription filling as measured by numbers of prescribed medications, prescribers, pharmacies, pharmacy visits, and pharmacy visits per prescription fill [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-to-lipid-altering-medications-and-recommended-lifestyle-changes/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Simplified regimens or the use of charts or pill organizers can improve adherence, as can involving spouses, other family members, or home nursing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-to-lipid-altering-medications-and-recommended-lifestyle-changes/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Cost, inconvenience, and lifestyle barriers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Financial cost is a barrier for many patients. The inconvenience of changing a daily routine to incorporate medications, or the maintenance of a medication schedule while traveling, camping, or on vacation may affect adherence. A study found that obtaining statins through a mail-order pharmacy rather than a local pharmacy was associated with improved control of LDL-cholesterol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-to-lipid-altering-medications-and-recommended-lifestyle-changes/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Medications also often require lifestyle changes (eg, in alcohol consumption and diet) that may be difficult to implement or maintain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Health beliefs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Health beliefs are particularly important in medication adherence (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F82636\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82636 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-to-lipid-altering-medications-and-recommended-lifestyle-changes/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk perceptions concerning illness &ndash; The perceived threat of cardiovascular disease is often minimized by patients (eg, patients in their 30s or 40s who believe they are not susceptible to an &quot;old person's&quot; disease).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perceived benefits of treatment &ndash; Clear communication of progress (changes in lipid values and their meaning to the patient) is essential. The lack of perceived symptoms in lipid disorders means that the patient's understanding of the benefits of treatment and his or her motivation to continue is based upon the effectiveness of communication with the medical team.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Barrier beliefs concerning medicines or a specific medicine &ndash; Patients often are concerned about medication interactions or taking too many medications (eg, &quot;When I have to take so many medications, I feel old&quot;). They also frequently have misinformation or misunderstandings about treatment (eg, &quot;When my labs are normal, I can quit treatment&quot;). Personal beliefs about &quot;becoming dependent&quot; upon medicine or preferences for lifestyle changes or alternative approaches to healthcare also frequently affect medication adherence.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECIFIC FACTORS AFFECTING ADHERENCE TO LIFESTYLE RECOMMENDATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to medication adherence concerns, other factors affect adherence to lifestyle changes. Patients often struggle with remembering and following through on lifestyle recommendations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-to-lipid-altering-medications-and-recommended-lifestyle-changes/abstract/15,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Stage of change</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient's stage of change (their readiness to adopt a change in lifestyle) is a more important consideration for lifestyle recommendations than when medications are prescribed. The discussion which follows is based upon the Stages of Change Model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-to-lipid-altering-medications-and-recommended-lifestyle-changes/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Effective clinician intervention differs at each stage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F65493\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65493 \">table 2</a>). In assessing stage of change, the question for the clinician is whether the patient is ready to adopt the recommended lifestyle change.</p><p>If not, is the patient:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not thinking about it at all (precontemplation stage)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thinking about it (contemplation stage)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ready to start planning (preparation stage)</p><p/><p>If so, is the patient:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ready to implement it (action stage)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Already making the change (maintenance stage)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Cost, inconvenience, and lifestyle barriers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to the cost, lifestyle, and readiness issues identified above, past experience with the recommended behavior is often critical in making a lifestyle change such as stopping smoking or losing weight. Although patients often characterize past experiences as failures, these experiences may provide useful information regarding why they &quot;failed&quot; and give clues about what they need to do to succeed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Health beliefs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The perceived risk of illness discussed above is relevant to both medication and lifestyle adherence, but the following health beliefs are primarily relevant to making successful lifestyle changes.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perceived benefits of lifestyle change &ndash; Patients may need information regarding the connection between exercise, weight reduction, or other lifestyle change and the desired medical outcome. Misinformation or ignorance is common (eg, patients often are not aware that a modest weight loss or increase in exercise can be medically beneficial, or that even infrequent smoking increases the risk of sudden cardiac death). Poor lifestyle assessment by the patient is also common (eg, patients often overestimate the amount of exercise they get on their job).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perceived barriers to lifestyle change &ndash; Personal barrier beliefs may be challenging (eg, &quot;Smoking is my only pleasure&quot;), but often may be addressed indirectly (eg, by helping the patient develop other sources of pleasure). Cultural barrier beliefs about lifestyle changes may also need to be discussed (eg, &quot;If you're too thin, you're not healthy&quot;), as will peer group beliefs and pressures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Self-efficacy beliefs &ndash; Based upon past experience, patients often believe they are not capable of making recommended lifestyle changes. This is highly predictive of the initial effort in making change [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-to-lipid-altering-medications-and-recommended-lifestyle-changes/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Low self-efficacy can be changed over time with education and positive experiences of success.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Social support</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Social support for making lifestyle change is particularly important. Absence of support can add to the patient's sense that having an illness or treating it doesn't matter, and may exacerbate depression. Attitudes of spouse, family and friends can support or undermine motivation for medication treatment or lifestyle change. Their specific behaviors can directly affect the ability to adhere to a treatment plan (eg, quitting smoking when a spouse smokes; changing to a low-fat diet when family traditions involve high-fat foods).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">STRATEGIES FOR INCREASING ADHERENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinicians can incorporate knowledge of the above factors into regular patient visits without adding significantly to the amount of time spent with patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Reduce the likelihood of nonadherence in advance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient's difficulties in initiating change need to be addressed at the time recommendations for medications or lifestyle changes are made.</p><p>The following initial measures may therefore improve patient adherence and outcome:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Provide a rationale for the treatment in the patient's language &ndash; Health care providers should identify and support the patient's positive, personal reasons for treatment and lifestyle changes, address misperceptions of illness risk and reinforce the positive medical benefits of treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use motivational interviewing strategies where possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-to-lipid-altering-medications-and-recommended-lifestyle-changes/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>] &ndash; Perhaps the most difficult task of a clinical encounter that includes a discussion of adherence is conducting it in such a way as to allow the patient to maintain a high level of personal motivation for adherence to treatment after the encounter. Motivational interviewing strategies such as eliciting the patient's perspective on taking medication and making lifestyle changes, expressing acceptance and support for the patient's difficulties and successes, affirming the patient's freedom to choose the best course of action, and accurately identifying and responding to the patient's stage of change have research-based evidence of success in accomplishing this.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identify and address general barriers to adherence &ndash; Formal assessment of general barriers does not need to be conducted with every patient. However, the caregiver should assess suspected cognitive impairment with a mental status examination and suspected psychopathology with questions relating to mood, coping, sleep and appetite disturbance. Caregivers should always assess motivation for treatment by asking why they want to undergo treatment and encouraging them to have personal as well as medical reasons for treatment, and functional illiteracy by asking patients to repeat and explain treatment instructions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Collaborate on the treatment plan &ndash; The patient's health beliefs and concerns should be incorporated into the treatment plan.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identify and address specific barriers to implementation &ndash; The caregiver should assess the patient's stage of change and develop an appropriate stage intervention (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F65493\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65493 \">table 2</a>); address cost and functional barriers to treatment and barrier beliefs regarding medications or lifestyle changes; and confirm agreement and patient understanding by asking the patient to describe schedule and specific directions for taking medications, or define the lifestyle treatment goal and the method for achieving it.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Encourage the patient to obtain social support for treatment &ndash; In making lifestyle changes, family and friends can help with encouragement and motivation during the action stage, and with stimulus control and reinforcement during the maintenance stage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52715\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52715 \">table 3</a>). Support groups of others making similar changes (eg, WomenHeart, Mended Hearts) are helpful in reinforcing positive health motivations and behaviors, and in providing good role models.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Frequent follow-up &ndash; Phone calls, letters, or Email from nurses or other clinic staff can improve adherence substantially by answering patient questions, monitoring and addressing patient-initiated cessation of treatment, and reinforcing motivation for continuing engagement in medical treatment or lifestyle change.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 2016 Cochrane Review recommends intensive team-based interventions to improve patient adherence to lipid-lowering medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-to-lipid-altering-medications-and-recommended-lifestyle-changes/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Identify and address nonadherence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In follow-up visits, patient adherence needs to be assessed, and nonadherence dealt with using the following principles:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assess adherence during each appointment by two simple questions &ndash; &quot;In the past two weeks, what percent of your cholesterol medicine have you taken?&quot; (If less than 100 percent), &quot;What is the main reason you might miss your medication?&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ask about medication side effects or problems associated with nonadherence to lifestyle change.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identify nonadherence and distinguish it from ineffectiveness of treatment &ndash; The caregiver should maintain an open, nonjudgmental attitude to encourage truthful discussion about adherence, and assess patient understanding of treatment protocol by asking the patient to describe treatment plan in detail [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/adherence-to-lipid-altering-medications-and-recommended-lifestyle-changes/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Patient adherence should be assessed using multiple information sources (treatment outcome, patient report, spouse report, etc), and additional evidence should be obtained as needed (eg, note if prescriptions are being renewed at appropriate times, and, when feasible, have patients bring pill bottles to every doctor visit to examine use). Finally, the clinician should decide whether the percentage of likely nonadherence accounts for treatment ineffectiveness.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Address nonadherence from the patient's perspective &ndash; Both general and specific factors influencing adherence should be identified for discussion. Also, discuss nonadherence in the context of the patient's values, but let the patient come to a decision about what should be done (eg, &quot;You said you wanted to be around to see your grandchildren grow up, but you are not taking your medication. What do you make of that?&quot;).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get help from other clinic staff in monitoring the patient, following-up, and reinforcing positive aspects of adherence.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Deal with continuing nonadherence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Continuing nonadherence can be frustrating for the clinician as well as the patient, and can affect their short- and long-term relationship. Although caregivers should actively support adherence, they should also encourage an ongoing discussion about adherence issues from the nonadherent patient's perspective. While acknowledging patient concerns, caregivers can help patients notice symptom remission and improved laboratory results associated with treatment and lifestyle change and can encourage them to find social support or assistance for adherence.</p><p>In addition, health care providers should decide how continuing nonadherence will affect their relationship with the patient. If necessary, clinicians should give patient conditions to meet if they expect to continue treatment. However, offering understanding and being willing to work with a nonadherent patient may improve future adherence or adherence with other caregivers.

A high-intensity statin regimen should reduce LDL-C by at least 50 percent from baseline, while a moderate-intensity statin regimen should reduce LDL-C by 30 to 50 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients who do not demonstrate this reduction in LDL-C and who are tolerating statin therapy should have the importance of adherence to medications and lifestyle changes reinforced and secondary causes of hypercholesterolemia excluded. Repeat lipid testing should be performed in 4 to 12 weeks. If LDL-C levels do not fall as anticipated, adherence should again be reinforced and consideration given to increasing statin intensity or adding nonstatin lipid lowering medications.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients who demonstrate an appropriate reduction in LDL-C should also have the importance of adherence reinforced and have repeat lipid testing performed every 3 to 12 months.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients.

(See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Reduce the likelihood of nonadherence in advance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinicians should identify nonadherence and its causes by asking nonjudgmental questions about adherence, and by asking about medication side effects and the burdens of lifestyle changes. Clinicians should try to address issues by working from the patient's perspective. An excellent clinician-patient relationship is key. The clinician must work toward establishing a collaborative process for problem solving.
