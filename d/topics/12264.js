Evidence of bilateral ovarian involvement suggests the presence of a tumor with a propensity for involvement of the contralateral ovary, including benign cystic teratoma, dysgerminoma, or a tumor with components of dysgerminoma (mixed germ cell tumor). These conditions are bilateral in 10 to 12 percent of cases, while the majority of other histologies present as unilateral ovarian masses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-germ-cell-tumors-pathology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Epidemiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>OGCTs arise primarily in young women between 10 and 30 years of age; they represent 70 percent of ovarian neoplasms in this age group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-germ-cell-tumors-pathology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

The diagnosis is strongly suggested preoperatively by the presence of an adnexal mass on pelvic imaging and an elevated level of an associated tumor marker (eg, hCG, AFP).</p><p>For benign cystic mature teratomas, the diagnosis can be made with reasonable confidence using pelvic ultrasonography; however, removal of the cyst is still advised. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Mature teratoma (dermoid)'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Tumor markers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>OGCTs are often associated with hormonal or enzymatic activity.

In brief, stage I disease is confined to the ovaries, stage II includes extension into other pelvic tissues, stage III refers to disease that has spread beyond the pelvis or to retroperitoneal lymph nodes but remains in the abdomen, and stage IV refers to the presence of distant metastasis or involvement of liver parenchyma.</p><p>In virtually all cases, surgery is required for definitive histologic diagnosis, treatment, and staging (if malignant) of OGCTs. Oophorectomy, ovarian cystectomy, or resection of the ovarian mass can be performed, depending on the clinical situation, and tissue sent for frozen section. Confirmation of the diagnosis should be obtained prior to definitive surgical treatment.</p><p>The following sections review the pathology and clinical manifestations of the individual types of OGCTs. Treatment of benign OGCTs is also described below, while management of malignant OGCTs is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-malignant-germ-cell-tumors-of-the-ovary\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of malignant germ cell tumors of the ovary&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">TERATOMAS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Teratomas are the most common type of germ cell tumor. Most, but not all, teratomas are benign. The designation teratoma refers to a neoplasm that differentiates toward somatic-type cell populations (typically including cell populations that would normally derive from ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm) that can be typical of either adult or embryonic development. The component tissues in a teratoma range from immature to well differentiated and are foreign to the anatomic site in which they are found.</p><p>Teratomas are divided into four categories: mature (cystic or solid, benign), immature (malignant), malignant due to a component of another somatic malignant neoplasm, and monodermal or highly specialized.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Mature teratoma (dermoid)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most teratomas are cystic and composed of mature differentiated elements (mature); they are better known as dermoid cysts. The mature cystic teratoma accounts for more than 95 percent of all ovarian teratomas and is almost invariably benign [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-germ-cell-tumors-pathology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Dermoid cysts are the most common ovarian tumor in women in the second and third decade of life.</p><p>In rare instances, a teratoma is solid but is composed entirely of benign-appearing heterogeneous collections of tissue and organized structures derived from all three cell layers. Most mature solid teratomas are unilateral and benign, although peritoneal implants have been described. Grossly, it may be <span class=\"nowrap\">difficult/impossible</span> to differentiate these neoplasms from malignant solid immature teratomas, which are almost always solid, and they therefore may require sampling from multiple sites (see <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Immature teratoma'</a> below). Management is as described above for mature cystic teratomas. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Histopathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mature cystic teratomas contain mature tissue of ectodermal (eg, skin, hair follicles, sebaceous glands), mesodermal (eg, muscle, urinary), and endodermal origin (eg, lung, gastrointestinal) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-germ-cell-tumors-pathology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The mechanism by which these cysts develop is possibly by failure of meiosis II or from a premeiotic cell in which meiosis I has failed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-germ-cell-tumors-pathology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. They are bilateral in 10 to 17 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-germ-cell-tumors-pathology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>The characteristic macroscopic appearance of benign cystic teratomas is a multicystic mass that contains hair, teeth, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> skin that is mixed into sebaceous, thick, sticky, and often foul-smelling material (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F70608\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70608 \">picture 1</a>). A solid prominence (Rokitansky protuberance) is located at the junction between the teratoma and normal ovarian tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-germ-cell-tumors-pathology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The greatest cellular variety is found in the area of this junction, which should therefore be examined carefully by the pathologist to exclude <span class=\"nowrap\">immature/malignant</span> components.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most women with dermoid cysts are asymptomatic. If present, symptoms depend upon the size of the mass. Torsion is not uncommon. Rupture of dermoid cysts with spillage of sebaceous material into the abdominal cavity can occur, but is uncommon. Shock and hemorrhage are the immediate sequelae of rupture; a marked granulomatous reaction (chemical peritonitis) may subsequently develop and lead to formation of dense adhesions.</p><p>A rare condition associated with either mature or immature teratomas is Anti-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor encephalitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-germ-cell-tumors-pathology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paraneoplastic-and-autoimmune-encephalitis#H3370789\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paraneoplastic and autoimmune encephalitis&quot;, section on 'Anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>These tumors have a characteristic ultrasound appearance, which allows reasonably accurate noninvasive diagnosis in many cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-germ-cell-tumors-pathology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The reported specificity is 98 to 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-germ-cell-tumors-pathology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Definitive diagnosis is made at the time of surgical excision. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ultrasound-differentiation-of-benign-versus-malignant-adnexal-masses\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ultrasound differentiation of benign versus malignant adnexal masses&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ovarian cystectomy is suggested in order to make a definitive diagnosis, preserve ovarian tissue, and avoid potential problems such as torsion, rupture, or development of malignant components. For women who have completed childbearing, salpingo-oophorectomy is also acceptable treatment. Benign cystic teratomas do not recur if surgically resected.</p><p>Dermoid cysts may be removed via either laparoscopy or laparotomy. With either approach, the abdomen should be copiously irrigated to avoid a chemical peritonitis from spillage of the sebaceous cyst fluid. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oophorectomy-and-ovarian-cystectomy#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oophorectomy and ovarian cystectomy&quot;, section on 'Laparoscopic cystectomy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Malignant transformation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Malignant transformation occurs in 0.2 to 2 percent of mature cystic teratomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-germ-cell-tumors-pathology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. Mature teratomas with malignant transformation comprise 2.9 percent of all malignant OGCTs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F72483\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72483 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-germ-cell-tumors-pathology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Although any of the components of a mature cystic teratoma may undergo malignant degeneration, squamous cell carcinoma arising from the ectoderm is the most common secondary neoplasm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-germ-cell-tumors-pathology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/14,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,21</a>].</p><p>Risk factors for malignant neoplasm in a mature cystic teratoma include age over 45 years (mean age, 50 years versus 33 years for benign teratomas), tumor diameter greater than 10 cm, rapid growth, and findings on imaging (eg, low-resistance intratumor flow on Doppler) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-germ-cell-tumors-pathology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/14,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,21</a>].</p><p>Other possible malignant neoplasms include (but are not limited to) basal cell carcinoma, melanoma, adenocarcinoma, sarcoma, and thyroid carcinoma. When malignant transformation has occurred within a teratoma, treatment must be tailored to the transformed histology.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Monodermal highly specialized teratomas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The specialized or monodermal teratomas are a rare and remarkable subset of teratomas that consist of a predominant mature histologic cell type. The most common of these are struma ovarii and carcinoid (a well-differentiated neuroendocrine neoplasm). They are usually unilateral, although a contralateral teratoma may be present.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Struma ovarii &ndash; Struma ovarii is a teratoma predominantly composed of mature thyroid tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-germ-cell-tumors-pathology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The secretion of thyroid hormones results in clinical hyperthyroidism in 25 to 35 percent of patients. Struma ovarii is uncommon, comprising approximately 2.7 percent of ovarian teratomas. It is often associated with a mature cystic teratoma and rarely with a cystadenoma. Most cases of struma ovarii are benign and can be managed by excision of the ovary or by unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. However, malignant change may occur in struma ovarii, but it is exceedingly rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-germ-cell-tumors-pathology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].

Primary ovarian carcinoid neoplasms are usually unilateral, localized to the ovary, and indistinguishable histologically from metastasis. They have similar appearances to those that arise in any other site (eg, gastrointestinal or respiratory). They are comprised of nests and cords of relatively bland cells (uniform cells without nuclear atypia) with endocrine features and a fine vascular network. Some carcinoid neoplasms secrete bioactive polypeptides and amines, producing a constellation of symptoms, predominantly flushing and diarrhea (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F63079\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63079 \">table 5</a>). Carcinoid syndrome develops in about one-third of cases, and it can develop without hepatic metastases due to direct venous drainage from the ovary into the systemic circulation.

The grade of differentiation (ranging from I [well differentiated] to III [poorly differentiated]) is based upon the proportion of tissue in histologic sections containing immature neural elements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-germ-cell-tumors-pathology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Grade is an important indicator of the risk for extraovarian spread.

The majority of cases (75 percent) arise in adolescents and young adults, in whom they account for about one-third of all ovarian malignant neoplasms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-germ-cell-tumors-pathology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Because of their predilection for young women, they are one of the more common ovarian malignant neoplasms detected during pregnancy. Nevertheless, dysgerminoma can occur at any age; case reports have described patients with dysgerminoma between 7 months and 70 years of age.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Histopathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although dysgerminomas are considered to be malignant, the degree of histologic atypia is variable, and only about one-third behave aggressively. The neoplasm is composed of undifferentiated germ cells, large vesicular cells with clear cytoplasm, well-defined cell boundaries, and centrally placed regular nuclei; the overall appearance is sometimes described as resembling &quot;fried eggs&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F79890\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79890 \">picture 2</a>). The stroma is infiltrated by clusters of small lymphocytes and frequently contains granulomas. Dysgerminoma is the ovarian counterpart of testicular seminoma; histologically it has a similar appearance. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anatomy-and-pathology-of-testicular-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anatomy and pathology of testicular tumors&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Grossly, dysgerminoma appears as a lobulated mass that is firm and cream colored or pale tan (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F73177\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73177 \">picture 3</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-germ-cell-tumors-pathology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Dysgerminomas may develop within a gonadoblastoma (a benign or in situ germ cell ovarian neoplasm composed of germ cells and sex cord stroma) in phenotypic females who have a Y chromosome. Included in this group are patients with pure gonadal dysgenesis 46XY, mixed gonadal dysgenesis <span class=\"nowrap\">45X/46XY,</span> or complete androgen insensitivity (formerly called testicular feminization) 46XY. Occasional patients may have features of Turner syndrome. These latter patients may have a 45X, <span class=\"nowrap\">45X/46XX,</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">45X/46XY</span> karyotype. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-turner-syndrome#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Turner syndrome&quot;, section on 'Risk of malignancy'</a>.)</p><p>The first two patients with unique gonadal tumors were described in 1953, at which time the term gonadoblastoma was introduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-germ-cell-tumors-pathology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. These tumors may produce either testosterone or estrogens. Clinical presentation may include developmental abnormalities of the genitalia, primary amenorrhea, or virilization. Although gonadoblastoma may be overgrown by dysgerminoma, as occurs in approximately 50 percent of cases, other malignant germ cell components may predominate, including yolk sac tumor, immature teratoma, embryonal carcinoma, or choriocarcinoma. Thus, karyotyping is recommended for all patients with the operative finding of gonadoblastoma, with or without a coexistent malignant germ cell tumor, or young patients who present with an ovarian mass or masses and either primary amenorrhea or abnormalities of the genitalia.</p><p>It is important to determine whether a gonadoblastoma is present, since oophorectomy should be performed in these patients to prevent the development of gonadal neoplasia, although the age at which the procedure is performed depends upon the underlying etiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-germ-cell-tumors-pathology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].

In addition, 3 to 5 percent of dysgerminomas produce human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). In general, dysgerminomas do not produce alpha fetoprotein (AFP), although borderline elevations (&lt;16 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL)</span> are described in case series, but most often in the setting of mixed germ cell tumors that contain a yolk sac element.</p><p>Seventy-five percent of women with dysgerminomas present with stage I disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F113545\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113545 \">table 4</a>); the contralateral ovary is involved in 10 to 15 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-germ-cell-tumors-pathology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].
