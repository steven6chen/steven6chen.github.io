This patient has type 1 diabetes based on the history of diabetic ketoacidosis; the apparent lack of insulin resistance; the absence of other features of the metabolic syndrome such as obesity, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia; and the lability of the blood glucose values. When tested, the patient is found to have anti-islet antibodies. She needs a physiologic regimen of insulin replacement. </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Metformin</a> is not indicated in a patient with type 1 diabetes. In this patient, by decreasing hepatic glucose output, metformin might reduce peak glucose values but increase the frequency and severity of hypoglycemic events.</p><p>Return to the beginning to try again.
