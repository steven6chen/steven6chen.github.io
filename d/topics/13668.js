This cyst can become red, inflamed, and infected. It can also cause pain and make it uncomfortable to sit or lie back.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25807401\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of pilonidal cyst?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the cyst is not infected, it might not cause symptoms. But if the cyst is infected, it can cause pain, redness, and swelling in the area above the crease where the buttocks come together. In some cases, the cyst might burst and drain fluid, blood, or pus (a milky yellow or green fluid).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25807416\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes, if you have symptoms of a pilonidal cyst, you should see a doctor or nurse. He or she can do an exam and let you know what might be causing your symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25807431\"><span class=\"h1\">How is a pilonidal cyst treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment for a pilonidal cyst usually involves either draining the cyst or removing it with surgery.</p><p>Draining a cyst can usually be done at the doctor's office. To drain a cyst, a doctor or nurse will first numb the area. Then he or she can cut open the cyst, drain it, and wash it out. In some cases, the doctor or nurse might also pack the empty cyst with gauze, or leave a drain in place.</p><p>Removing a cyst involves surgery, so it is done in an operating room at the hospital. Right before the surgery, people having the surgery either get a shot to numb the area, or a shot to numb the area plus some medicine to make them drowsy. People having the surgery can usually go home the same day.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25807446\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=boil-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Boil (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
