Medication overuse headache, a secondary headache disorder, frequently complicates management of multiple primary headache disorders.</p><p>Primary headache types of shorter duration that can be chronic and occur daily are chronic cluster headache, chronic paroxysmal hemicrania, hypnic headache, and primary stabbing headache.</p><p>This topic will provide an overview of the subtypes of CDH. These headache subtypes are discussed in greater detail individually in appropriate separate topic reviews.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">SUBTYPES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic daily headache (CDH) is not a specific headache type, but a syndrome that encompasses other primary and secondary headaches. The term &quot;chronic&quot; in CDH refers either to the frequency of headaches or to the duration of the disease, depending upon the specific headache type.</p><p>The classification of CDH as a form of headache is based upon criteria originally proposed in 1996 by Silberstein and Lipton (the SL criteria) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-daily-headache/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition (ICHD-3) does not define CDH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-daily-headache/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Rather, CDH is a descriptive term that encompasses five subtypes of frequent headaches defined by ICHD-3:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic migraine headache</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic tension-type headache</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medication overuse headache</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemicrania continua</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>New daily persistent headache</p><p/><p>These headache types are characterized by prolonged headaches lasting four hours or longer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-daily-headache/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The term CDH is applied when the headache frequency is 15 or more days a month for longer than three months in the absence of organic pathology.</p><p>Additional headache subtypes with shorter individual headaches (ie, less than four hours) are considered in the spectrum of CDH when the duration of the condition itself persists without remission. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic cluster headache (must persist for at least one year without remission)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic paroxysmal hemicrania (must persist for at least one year without remission)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypnic headache</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Short-lasting unilateral, neuralgiform headache attacks</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary stabbing headache</p><p/><p>The subtypes of CDH are briefly reviewed in the following sections, and are discussed in greater detail in individual topic reviews as noted for each subtype.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic migraine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic migraine typically occurs in those with a history of episodic migraine headache. Through a process known as migraine transformation, some patients with an episodic migraine pattern transition to a chronic migraine pattern (&ge;15 headache days a month). Many patients with chronic migraine have daily or near-daily headaches of low to moderate severity. Superimposed on this baseline are exacerbations of pain with more prominent migrainous features. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-migraine\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic migraine&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic tension-type headache</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tension-type headache is a bilateral, nonthrobbing &quot;featureless&quot; headache characterized by gradual onset and mild to moderate intensity with or without pericranial muscle tenderness. Chronic tension-type headache is diagnosed when the headache is present for 15 or more days a month. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tension-type-headache-in-adults-pathophysiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tension-type headache in adults: Pathophysiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Medication overuse headache</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medication overuse headache (MOH), a secondary type of headache, was previously termed analgesic rebound headache, drug-induced headache, and medication-misuse headache. MOH is the classification used when a primary headache develops or markedly worsens during medication overuse. In practice, MOH is typically preceded by an episodic headache disorder, most often migraine or tension-type, that has been treated with frequent and excessive amounts of acute symptomatic medications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medication-overuse-headache-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medication overuse headache: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemicrania continua</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hemicrania continua is a strictly unilateral, continuous headache with superimposed exacerbations of moderate to severe intensity accompanied by autonomic features and sometimes by migrainous symptoms. It is responsive to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indomethacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">indomethacin</a>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemicrania-continua\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemicrania continua&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">New daily persistent headache</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The syndrome of new daily persistent headache is characterized by headache that begins rather abruptly and is daily and unremitting from onset or within three days of onset at most, typically in individuals without a prior headache history. Considerable variability is seen in the clinical features. The pain is often bilateral, pressing or tightening in quality, and of mild to moderate intensity. However, migrainous features such as unilateral headache, throbbing pain, and associated photophobia are common. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=new-daily-persistent-headache\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;New daily persistent headache&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic cluster headache</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cluster headache is one of the trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias, a group of primary headache disorders characterized by unilateral trigeminal distribution pain that occurs in association with ipsilateral cranial autonomic features. Cluster headache is characterized by attacks of severe unilateral orbital, supraorbital, or temporal pain. Unilateral autonomic symptoms are ipsilateral to the pain and may include ptosis, miosis, lacrimation, conjunctival injection, rhinorrhea, and nasal congestion. Attacks usually last 15 to 180 minutes.</p><p>In the episodic form, attacks occur daily, usually one to eight times a day for some weeks, followed by a period of remission. The chronic form of cluster headache lacks sustained remissions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cluster-headache-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cluster headache: Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic paroxysmal hemicrania</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Like cluster headache, paroxysmal hemicrania is one of the trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias. Patients typically have unilateral, brief, severe attacks of pain associated with cranial autonomic features that recur several times per day. An individual headache attack usually lasts 2 to 30 minutes by definition. The mean attack frequency is 11 to 14 daily. About 80 percent of patients have the chronic form of paroxysmal hemicrania, in which either no remission occurs within one year, or the remissions last less than one month. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paroxysmal-hemicrania-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paroxysmal hemicrania: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypnic headache</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypnic headache, also known as &quot;alarm clock headache,&quot; occurs almost exclusively after the age of 50, and is characterized by episodes of dull head pain, often bilateral, that awaken the sufferer from sleep. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypnic-headache\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypnic headache&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks are divided into two subtypes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection and tearing (SUNCT)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with cranial autonomic symptoms (SUNA)</p><p/><p>SUNCT and SUNA are characterized by sudden brief attacks of severe unilateral head pain in orbital, peri-orbital, or temporal regions, accompanied by ipsilateral cranial autonomic symptoms. In SUNCT, the ipsilateral autonomic symptoms consist of both conjunctival injection and lacrimation. In SUNA, the autonomic symptoms may include either conjunctival injection or lacrimation, but not both, and there can be other cranial autonomic symptoms (eg, nasal congestion <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> rhinorrhea, or eyelid edema). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=short-lasting-unilateral-neuralgiform-headache-attacks-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary stabbing headache</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary stabbing headache is characterized by sudden brief attacks of sharp, jabbing head pain in orbital, peri-orbital, or temporal regions. The stabs last a few seconds and occur at irregular intervals from once to many times each day. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-stabbing-headache\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary stabbing headache&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of chronic daily headache (CDH) among adults worldwide is approximately 4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-daily-headache/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. Women are affected two to three times more often than men. The vast majority of CDH patients suffer from either chronic tension-type headache, chronic migraine, or medication overuse headache.</p><p>CDH results in significant pain and suffering, reductions in quality of life, and enormous economic costs to society [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-chronic-daily-headache/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of chronic daily headache (CDH) is suspected on the basis of a compatible headache history. Other disorders causing secondary headache must be excluded.</p><p>The diagnosis of CDH is made when there is a pattern of frequent headaches that fulfill diagnostic criteria for one of the forms of CDH characterized by prolonged headaches, which are chronic migraine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F56064\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56064 \">table 1</a>), chronic tension-type headache (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F68892\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68892 \">table 2</a>), medication overuse headache (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F71798\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71798 \">table 3</a>), hemicrania continua (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F62652\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62652 \">table 4</a>), and new daily persistent headache (NDPH) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F76010\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76010 \">table 5</a>). Of note, some experts make the diagnosis of NDPH despite the presence of migrainous features. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=new-daily-persistent-headache#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;New daily persistent headache&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic criteria'</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis is also made when there is persistence of headache subtypes with shorter individual headaches (ie, chronic cluster headache, chronic paroxysmal hemicrania, hypnic headache, or primary stabbing headache) for at least one year without remission.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnostic process of CDH does not differ from that of other headache types. The clinician must determine the level of suspicion for a secondary versus a primary headache disorder. This is based upon a careful medical and headache history and a comprehensive physical and neurologic examination. With all subtypes of CDH it is important to evaluate for the possibility of medication overuse as a causal or contributing factor in the production of CDH. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medication-overuse-headache-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medication overuse headache: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Special attention should be directed to the carotid and temporal arteries, cervical paraspinal muscles, range of motion at the neck, temporomandibular joints, sinuses, and ocular fundi.

However, some headache types may be associated with specific abnormalities:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With tension-type headache, there may be pericranial muscle tenderness.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic migraine may have manifestations, such as hyperalgesia and allodynia, related to sensitization of primary nociceptors and central trigeminovascular neurons.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With hemicrania continua or one of the trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias (eg, cluster headache, paroxysmal hemicrania, short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with conjunctival injection and tearing [SUNCT]), there may be evidence of autonomic activation.</p><p/><p>Other abnormalities on examination should raise suspicion for a secondary headache disorder.</p><p>The findings of the clinical history and examination determine whether further diagnostic testing is necessary.
