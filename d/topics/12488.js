Mounting evidence suggests that municipal water sources may be an important source for MAC lung infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections-in-hiv-negative-patients/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. Unlike <em>M. tuberculosis</em>, there are no convincing data demonstrating human-to-human or animal-to-human transmission of MAC.

They include cough (productive or dry), fatigue, malaise, weakness, dyspnea, chest discomfort, and occasionally hemoptysis. Fever and weight loss occur less frequently than in patients with typical tuberculosis. Examination of the lungs is often normal but, since these infections frequently coexist with underlying lung disease such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or bronchiectasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections-in-hiv-negative-patients/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], physical findings of the latter diseases may predominate.</p><p>Two major clinical presentations have been described:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disease in those with known underlying lung disease, primarily white, middle-aged, or elderly men, often alcoholics <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> smokers with underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The disease resembles typical tuberculosis clinically and radiographically, with cough, weight loss, upper lobe infiltrates, and cavities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections-in-hiv-negative-patients/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Symptoms are generally less severe than those associated with tuberculosis. Additionally, due to the relatively indolent nature of MAC lung disease, lung destruction may be quite extensive at the time of diagnosis with very large cavities on chest radiograph. Another presentation is seen in patients in whom MAC develops in areas of prior bronchiectasis, such as patients with prior tuberculosis. Older adults are also affected, but there is no association with male sex or smoking-related pulmonary disease. Most commonly, patients with prior treated tuberculosis develop symptoms, such as cough, sputum production, fatigue and weight loss, and a new infiltrate in the previously affected lung zone suggesting a relapse of tuberculosis. This pattern is also seen with other types of bronchiectasis including cystic fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections-in-hiv-negative-patients/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disease in those without known underlying lung disease predominantly in nonsmoking women over age 50 who have interstitial patterns on chest radiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections-in-hiv-negative-patients/abstract/9,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,13</a>]. For many clinicians, this is the form of MAC lung disease that is most commonly encountered. The typical presenting symptoms were persistent cough and purulent sputum, usually without fever or weight loss; the mean duration of cough was 25 weeks before the diagnosis was made [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections-in-hiv-negative-patients/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Previously thought to represent airway colonization, the serious nature of this disease has become increasingly evident. One report, for example, noted a 19 percent mortality rate from respiratory failure during longitudinal follow-up in 21 such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections-in-hiv-negative-patients/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. A syndrome of right middle lobe or lingular infiltrates, sometimes called the Lady Windermere syndrome, has been noted in elderly women without predisposing lung disease, volume loss, adenopathy, or cavitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections-in-hiv-negative-patients/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Radiographically, this form of MAC lung disease is almost invariably associated with nodules and bronchiectasis and is sometimes referred to as <span class=\"nowrap\">nodular/bronchiectatic</span> MAC lung disease. In a series of selected patients with this form of MAC lung disease, it was noted that patients with NTM tend to be taller and leaner than control subjects and have increased likelihood of pectus excavatum, scoliosis, and mitral valve prolapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections-in-hiv-negative-patients/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. These patients are also more likely to have cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator mutations in the absence of recognized immune defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections-in-hiv-negative-patients/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. There were no recognized immune defects such as cell-mediated immune dysfunction or cytokine pathway abnormalities identified in these patients. The pathophysiologic consequences of the morphologic abnormalities and their potential contribution(s) to the predisposition for MAC infection are not yet known.</p><p/><p>Two other less common forms of MAC lung disease have been described:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One report noted an unexpectedly high frequency (78 of 244 patients) of MAC pulmonary infections presenting as solitary pulmonary nodules, which resembled lung cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections-in-hiv-negative-patients/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Solitary pulmonary nodules caused by MAC were observed in 11 patients in South Korea in a retrospective study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections-in-hiv-negative-patients/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MAC exposure in immunocompetent hosts without underlying lung disease has been linked to the development of hypersensitivity pneumonitis, particularly following hot tub use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections-in-hiv-negative-patients/abstract/17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20</a>]. The resulting hypersensitivity reaction (&quot;hot tub lung&quot;) generally responds to avoidance of the offending environment, and the role of antibiotic therapy appears limited.

Six familial clusters of NTM disease, mostly caused by MAC, have been identified, although no specific immune defect was identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections-in-hiv-negative-patients/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>One study that included patients with both cavitary and noncavitary MAC lung disease found that <em>Mycobacterium</em>-stimulated peripheral blood monocytes (PBMC) produced higher concentrations of interleukin 10 (IL-10) but lower concentrations of interferon (IFN)-gamma, IL-12, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), compared with PBMC from control subjects with a delayed hypersensitivity skin test response to <em>M. avium</em> sensitin. The authors concluded that IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and IL-12 contributed to protection against MAC lung disease whereas IL-10 was immunosuppressive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections-in-hiv-negative-patients/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Another small case series noted a decreased interferon gamma response to mitogen stimulation in five such patients, which did not improve in two of the patients despite successful therapy with antimycobacterial agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections-in-hiv-negative-patients/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The study cited above in patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">nodular/bronchiectatic</span> disease found no cytokine pathway abnormalities to explain the apparent susceptibility for acquiring MAC lung disease in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections-in-hiv-negative-patients/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

The disease primarily occurs in severely immunocompromised patients, such as those with advanced HIV infection, hematologic malignancy, or a history of immunosuppressive therapy including therapy with tumor necrosis alpha inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections-in-hiv-negative-patients/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>].

Organ-specific symptoms and signs reflect the major sites of involvement including anemia and neutropenia from bone marrow involvement; adenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly from lymphoreticular involvement; diarrhea, abdominal pain, hepatomegaly, and elevations of liver enzymes from involvement of the gastrointestinal tract; and cough and lung infiltrates from pulmonary involvement.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis is most readily established by culture of blood for mycobacteria. It is important to note that mycobacterial blood cultures are collected in special media, different from the media used in standard bacterial blood cultures, and must be specifically requested. Mycobacterial cultures must be specifically requested so that the cultures are not discarded before there has been time to detect mycobacterial growth. Although mycobacterial growth can sometimes be detected as early as a few days after obtaining the culture, in general, mycobacterial cultures cannot be confidently deemed negative until six weeks have passed without growth.</p><p>Specimens from bone marrow, or fluid or tissue from suspected sites of involvement should also be submitted for culture and histopathology. Noncaseating granulomas on pathology are supportive of mycobacterial involvement. Bacillary forms may be visible on acid-fast staining, but their absence does not rule out the possibility of infection.</p><p>Although molecular testing has been used for epidemiological investigation, such techniques are generally not clinically available. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1111710550\"><span class=\"h3\">Management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Limited data are available to guide management of disseminated MAC in patients without HIV infection. Medical therapy typically consists of several antimycobacterial agents for at least several months. Patients with disseminated disease may also require adjunctive surgical intervention (eg, valve replacement, joint replacement, or debridement of infected bone) for clinical cure.</p><p>For patients with macrolide-susceptible disease, a multidrug regimen similar to that used for pulmonary MAC disease (a macrolide plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethambutol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ethambutol</a> plus a rifamycin) is generally used. Patients with extensive, severe, or life-threatening disease should also receive a parenteral aminoglycoside, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amikacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amikacin</a>, during the initial 8 to 12 weeks of therapy. </p><p>If the isolate is macrolide-resistant, therapy consists of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethambutol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ethambutol</a> plus a rifamycin, preferably <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifabutin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifabutin</a>, plus a parenteral aminoglycoside. The addition of another antimycobacterial agent, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=linezolid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">linezolid</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clofazimine-united-states-available-via-national-hansens-disease-program-and-fda-investigational-drug-ind-protocol-only-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clofazimine</a>, may also be of some value, although there are little data to support their use. The fluoroquinolones have no demonstrated activity or value in this setting.</p><p>Oral agents are administered daily. Parenteral aminoglycosides (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amikacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amikacin</a>) are administered two or three times weekly. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-mycobacterium-avium-complex-lung-infection-in-adults#H200369634\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of Mycobacterium avium complex lung infection in adults&quot;, section on 'Regimen selection'</a>.)</p><p>The optimal duration of treatment has not been established, but treatment is usually administered for at least six months. The precise duration depends on the underlying cause or predisposition for the disseminated MAC infection. As an example, for patients with easily remediable sources of MAC dissemination (ie, without a sequestered site of infection), six months of therapy may be adequate. In contrast, for patients with MAC infections in areas where antibiotic penetration is suboptimal, such as bone or joints, 12 months of therapy is likely necessary for cure. Similarly, for those patients with underlying immunosuppression, the duration of therapy depends on the severity and reversibility of the immune deficits. For patients with reversible or temporary immunosuppression, treatment duration is similar to that for HIV-infected patients with disseminated MAC who recover immune function (ie, at least 12 months of treatment with at least six months of immune reconstitution). For patients with persistent and severe immunosuppression, the adequate duration of therapy is not established, and may be open ended. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycobacterium-avium-complex-mac-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients#H28\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) infections in HIV-infected patients&quot;, section on 'Duration of MAC therapy'</a>.)</p><p>One difficult aspect of treating extra-pulmonary MAC infection is the lack of diagnostic tools to measure treatment outcome. Whereas sputum AFB cultures and chest radiographic studies are relatively easy to obtain and follow to evaluate a patient's response to therapy for pulmonary MAC disease, obtaining sequential cultures may be essentially impossible for many extra-pulmonary sites. The reliability of sequential imaging for sites such as bone and joints is also not established.

Two prolonged outbreaks of <em>M. chimaera</em> prosthetic valve infections and associated disseminated infection, in which the source was determined through epidemiologic and molecular analysis to be the heater-cooler unit used for cardiac bypass procedures, were first described in 2015 in Europe and the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections-in-hiv-negative-patients/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>], and subsequent clusters have been reported elsewhere [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections-in-hiv-negative-patients/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. Molecular testing further suggested that the source of contamination of the implicated heater-cooler devices (Stockert 3T) was the manufacturing facility itself [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections-in-hiv-negative-patients/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have made several recommendations to try to lower the risk of additional infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections-in-hiv-negative-patients/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. These include removing from service any Stockert 3T heater-cooler device that has tested positive for <em>M. chimaera</em> or that has been associated with known <em>M. chimaera</em> infections, replacing accessories and connectors that were used with such devices, and refraining from using any 3T heater-cooler device manufactured before September 2014 except in emergent situations when no other device is available. Testing of devices to identify contamination is not recommended because of technical challenges and a high rate of false negative tests. </p><p>Although the risk is low, providers of patients who have undergone cardiac surgery should be aware of the possibility of <em>M. chimaera</em> infection if they develop signs and symptoms compatible with disseminated mycobacterial disease (eg, persistent fever, night sweats, weight loss). The majority of the patients described in the outbreaks presented with prosthetic valve endocarditis accompanied by other signs of disseminated disease including ocular emboli, bony involvement (eg, vertebral osteomyelitis), splenomegaly, pancytopenia, hepatitis, and renal impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections-in-hiv-negative-patients/abstract/27,28,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28,30</a>]. Other cases have involved surgical site infection. Patients presented months to years following the surgical procedure. Patients who have a presentation compatible with disseminated <em>M. chimaera</em> infection should have several mycobacterial blood cultures; depending on the clinical presentation, specimens from other sites should also be collected for microbiological and pathological testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections-in-hiv-negative-patients/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

There is also no precedent for a similar outbreak of nosocomial mycobacterial prosthetic valve endocarditis. The reason that this pathogen has manifest now with this clinical presentation is unknown. Nevertheless, the relatively rapid identification of an unusual pathogen as the cause of a nosocomial outbreak and the identification of the environmental source of the infecting organism is a testament to the utility of molecular epidemiologic techniques for mycobacteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections-in-hiv-negative-patients/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">MYCOBACTERIUM KANSASII</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unlike other NTM, <em>M. kansasii</em> has never been found in soil or natural water supplies, but has been recovered consistently from tap water in cities where <em>M. kansasii</em> is endemic.
