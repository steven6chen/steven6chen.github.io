Normally, women have a small amount of vaginal discharge each day. But women with bacterial vaginosis can have a lot of vaginal discharge, or vaginal discharge that smells bad.</p><p>Bacterial vaginosis is caused by certain bacteria (germs). The vagina normally has different types of bacteria in it. When the amounts or the types of bacteria change, an infection can happen.</p><p>Women do not catch bacterial vaginosis from having sex with men. But women who have bacterial vaginosis have a higher chance of catching other infections from their partner during sex. Women who have sex with other women might pass bacterial vaginosis on to their sex partners.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1664445905\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of bacterial vaginosis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many women with bacterial vaginosis have no symptoms. When women have symptoms, they often have a &quot;fishy-smelling&quot; vaginal discharge that they might notice more after sex. The discharge is watery and off-white or gray. Women may also notice a burning feeling in the vagina.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1664445912\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for bacterial vaginosis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse will do an exam. He or she will also take a sample of your vaginal discharge, and do lab tests on the sample to look for an infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1664445919\"><span class=\"h1\">How is bacterial vaginosis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bacterial vaginosis is treated with medicine. The 2 medicines most often used are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Metronidazole</a></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Clindamycin</a></p><p/><p>Both of these medicines come in different forms. They can come as a pill or as a gel or cream that a woman puts inside her vagina. Most women have fewer side effects when they use the gel or cream treatment. But you and your doctor or nurse will decide which medicine and which form is right for you.</p><p>It is important that you take all of the medicine your doctor or nurse prescribes, even if your symptoms go away after a few doses. Taking all of your medicine can help prevent the symptoms from coming back.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1664445926\"><span class=\"h1\">Does my sex partner need to be treated if I have bacterial vaginosis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It depends. If your sex partner is a man, he does not need to be treated if you have bacterial vaginosis. But if you have sex with other women, you should tell any partners about your bacterial vaginosis. That way they can be treated if they also get symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1664445933\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens if my symptoms come back?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your symptoms come back, let your doctor or nurse know. You might need treatment with more medicine.</p><p>Some women get bacterial vaginosis over and over again. These women might take medicine for 3 to 6 months to try to prevent future infections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1664445940\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I am pregnant and have symptoms of bacterial vaginosis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you are pregnant and have symptoms of bacterial vaginosis, tell your doctor or nurse. You might need treatment with medicine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1664445947\"><span class=\"h1\">Can bacterial vaginosis be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sometimes. You can help prevent bacterial vaginosis by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not douching (douching is when a woman puts a liquid inside her vagina to rinse it out)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not having a lot of sex partners</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not smoking</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1664445954\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaginal-discharge-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaginal discharge in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlamydia-and-gonorrhea-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chlamydia and gonorrhea (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hiv-aids-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: HIV/AIDS (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vulvovaginal-yeast-infection-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vulvovaginal yeast infection (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bacterial-vaginosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Bacterial vaginosis (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaginal-discharge-in-adult-women-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Vaginal discharge in adult women (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
