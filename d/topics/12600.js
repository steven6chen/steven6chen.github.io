Symptoms and signs remain indefinitely if the brain becomes irreversibly damaged and infarction occurs. Unfortunately, neurologic symptoms do not accurately reflect the presence or absence of infarction, and the tempo of the symptoms does not indicate the cause of the ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-evaluation-of-stroke/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. This is a critical issue because treatment depends upon accurately identifying the cause of symptoms.</p><p>An overview of the evaluation of patients who present with neurologic symptoms that may be consistent with stroke is discussed here.

Approximately 80 percent of strokes are due to ischemic cerebral infarction and 20 percent to brain hemorrhage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Transient brain ischemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TIA is now defined as a transient episode of neurologic dysfunction caused by focal brain, spinal cord, or retinal ischemia, without acute infarction. This tissue-based definition of TIA relies on the absence of end-organ injury as assessed by imaging or other techniques. The proposed advantages of the tissue-based definition are that the defined end point is biological (tissue injury) rather than arbitrary (24 hours). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-etiology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-transient-ischemic-attack#H2074998073\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, etiology, and clinical manifestations of transient ischemic attack&quot;, section on 'Definition of TIA'</a>.)</p><p>The approach to patients with TIA is reviewed separately.

The bleeding is directly into the brain, forming a localized hematoma which spreads along white matter pathways. Accumulation of blood occurs over minutes or hours; the hematoma gradually enlarges by adding blood at its periphery like a snowball rolling downhill. The most common causes of ICH are hypertension, trauma, bleeding diatheses, amyloid angiopathy, illicit drug use (mostly amphetamines and cocaine), and vascular malformations. Less frequent causes include bleeding into tumors, aneurysmal rupture, and vasculitis. Neurologic symptoms usually increase gradually over minutes or a few hours. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-diagnosis-of-stroke-subtypes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical diagnosis of stroke subtypes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Subarachnoid hemorrhage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rupture of arterial aneurysms is the major cause of subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). Aneurysm rupture releases blood directly into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) under arterial pressure. The blood spreads quickly within the CSF, rapidly increasing intracranial pressure. Death or deep coma ensues if the bleeding continues. The bleeding usually lasts only a few seconds but rebleeding is common. With causes of SAH other than aneurysm rupture (eg, vascular malformations, bleeding diatheses, trauma, amyloid angiopathy, and illicit drug use), the bleeding is less abrupt and may continue over a longer period of time.</p><p>Symptoms of SAH begin abruptly, occurring at night in 30 percent of cases. The primary symptom is a sudden, severe headache (97 percent of cases) classically described as the &quot;worst headache of my life.&quot; The headache is lateralized in 30 percent of patients, predominantly to the side of the aneurysm. The onset of the headache may or may not be associated with a brief loss of consciousness, seizure, nausea, vomiting, focal neurologic deficit, or stiff neck (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F60831\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60831 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-evaluation-of-stroke/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. There are usually no important focal neurologic signs at presentation unless bleeding occurs into the brain and CSF at the same time (meningocerebral hemorrhage). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aneurysmal-subarachnoid-hemorrhage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Ischemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are three main subtypes of brain ischemia:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thrombosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Embolism</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic hypoperfusion</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Thrombotic stroke</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thrombotic strokes are those in which the pathologic process giving rise to thrombus formation in an artery produces a stroke either by reduced blood flow distally (low flow) or by an embolic fragment that breaks off and travels to a more distant vessel (artery-to-artery embolism). All thrombotic strokes can be divided into either large or small vessel disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F55099\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55099 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Large vessel disease includes both the extracranial and intracranial arterial system; atherothrombosis is by far the most common pathologic process. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-symptoms-from-carotid-atherosclerosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of symptoms from carotid atherosclerosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intracranial-large-artery-atherosclerosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intracranial large artery atherosclerosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Small vessel disease refers specifically to penetrating arteries that arise from the distal vertebral artery, the basilar artery, the middle cerebral artery stem, and the arteries of the circle of Willis. These arteries thrombose due to atheroma formation at their origin or in the parent large artery, or due to lipohyalinosis (a lipid hyaline build-up distally secondary to hypertension). Penetrating artery (small vessel) disease can result in small deep infarcts usually referred to as lacunes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lacunar-infarcts\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lacunar infarcts&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Embolic stroke</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Embolism refers to particles of debris originating elsewhere that block arterial access to a particular brain region. Since the process is not local (as with thrombosis), local therapy only temporarily solves the problem; further events may occur if the source of embolism is not identified and treated.</p><p>Embolic strokes are divided into four categories (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F55099\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55099 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-classification-and-epidemiology-of-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology, classification, and epidemiology of stroke&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Those with a known source that is cardiac</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Those with a possible cardiac or aortic source based upon transthoracic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> transesophageal echocardiographic findings</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Those with an arterial source</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Those with a truly unknown source in which these tests are negative or inconclusive</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Systemic hypoperfusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systemic hypoperfusion is a more general circulatory problem, manifesting itself in the brain and perhaps other organs. Reduced perfusion can be due to cardiac pump failure caused by cardiac arrest or arrhythmia, or to reduced cardiac output related to acute myocardial ischemia, pulmonary embolism, pericardial effusion, or bleeding. Hypoxemia may further reduce the amount of oxygen carried to the brain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-diagnosis-of-stroke-subtypes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical diagnosis of stroke subtypes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL GENERAL ASSESSMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sudden loss of focal brain function is the core feature of the onset of ischemic stroke. However, patients with conditions other than brain ischemia can present in a similar fashion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F69869\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69869 \">table 3</a>). In addition, patients who have an ischemic stroke may present with other serious medical conditions. Thus, the initial evaluation requires a rapid but broad assessment. The goals in this initial phase include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insuring medical stability</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Quickly reversing any conditions that are contributing to the patient's problem</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Moving toward uncovering the pathophysiologic basis of the patient's neurologic symptoms.</p><p/><p>Diagnosing an intracerebral or subarachnoid hemorrhage as soon as possible can be lifesaving and prevent or minimize permanent neurologic damage. The history may provide clues to these diagnoses, but early triage of the patient to CT scan or MRI is critical. However, it is important to assess and optimize vital physiologic function <strong>before</strong> sending the patient for an imaging study. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-assessment-and-management-of-acute-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial assessment and management of acute stroke&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Vital signs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Parameters of particular concern in patients with stroke include blood pressure, breathing, and temperature.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Blood pressure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) is usually elevated in patients with an acute stroke. This may be due to chronic hypertension, which is a major risk factor for ischemic stroke. However, an acute elevation in blood pressure often represents an appropriate response to maintain brain perfusion. The decision to treat requires a balance between the potential danger of severe increases in blood pressure, and a possible decline in neurologic functioning when blood pressure is lowered. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-assessment-and-management-of-acute-stroke#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial assessment and management of acute stroke&quot;, section on 'Blood pressure management'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Breathing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with increased intracranial pressure (ICP) due to hemorrhage, vertebrobasilar ischemia, or bihemispheric ischemia can present with a decreased respiratory drive or muscular airway obstruction. Hypoventilation, with a resulting increase in the partial pressure of carbon dioxide, may lead to cerebral vasodilation which further elevates ICP.</p><p>Intubation may be necessary to restore adequate ventilation and to protect the airway. This is especially important in the presence of vomiting, which occurs commonly with increased ICP, vertebrobasilar ischemia, and intracranial hemorrhage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Fever</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fever may occur in patients with an acute stroke and can worsen brain ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-evaluation-of-stroke/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Normothermia should be maintained for at least the first several days after an acute stroke. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-assessment-and-management-of-acute-stroke#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial assessment and management of acute stroke&quot;, section on 'Fever'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">History and physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The history and physical examination should be used to distinguish between other disorders in the differential diagnosis of stroke (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F69869\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69869 \">table 3</a>). As examples, seizures, syncope, migraine, and hypoglycemia can mimic acute ischemia. The most difficult cases involve patients with focal signs and altered level of consciousness. It is important to ask the patient or a relative whether the patient takes insulin or oral hypoglycemic agents, has a history of a seizure disorder or drug overdose or abuse, medications on admission, recent trauma, or hysteria (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=differential-diagnosis-of-transient-ischemic-attack-and-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Differential diagnosis of transient ischemic attack and stroke&quot;</a>). The history is also important in separating ischemia from hemorrhage and distinguishing between subtypes of ischemia and hemorrhage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Ischemia versus hemorrhage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Noncontrast computed tomography (CT) is typically the first diagnostic study in patients with suspected stroke. The main advantages of CT are widespread access and speed of acquisition. CT is highly sensitive for the diagnosis of hemorrhage in the acute setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-evaluation-of-stroke/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Intracerebral hemorrhages are evident almost instantly after onset as focal white hyperdense lesions within the brain parenchyma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Head CT'</a>.)</p><p>Intracerebral hemorrhages can also be defined by MRI; the use of susceptibility sequences improves the sensitivity of MRI for early detection of hemorrhage. Gradient-echo images can also show the presence of old hemorrhages since this technique is very sensitive to hemosiderin, which can remain in old hemorrhages indefinitely. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spontaneous-intracerebral-hemorrhage-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Brain MRI'</a>.)</p><p>Small subarachnoid hemorrhages can be missed by either CT or MRI. Lumbar puncture may be needed to make the diagnosis in such patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aneurysmal-subarachnoid-hemorrhage#H28\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage&quot;, section on 'Lumbar puncture'</a>.)</p><p>MRI is more sensitive than CT for the early diagnosis of brain infarction, although CT may identify subtle indicators of infarction within six hours of stroke onset in a significant number of patients (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuroimaging-of-acute-ischemic-stroke#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuroimaging of acute ischemic stroke&quot;, section on 'Early signs of infarction on noncontrast CT'</a>). Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) MRI sequences and diffusion-weighted images (DWI-MRI) are especially useful in showing infarcts early after the onset of symptoms. In patients with ischemia who do not yet have brain infarction, both CT and MRI may be normal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuroimaging-of-acute-ischemic-stroke#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuroimaging of acute ischemic stroke&quot;, section on 'Magnetic resonance imaging'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Is the patient a candidate for reperfusion?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Timely restoration of blood flow is the most effective maneuver for salvaging ischemic brain tissue that is not already infarcted. There is a narrow time window during which this can be accomplished, since the benefit of reperfusion therapy for ischemic stroke decreases in a continuous fashion over time. Thus, an important aspect of the hyperacute phase of stroke assessment is to determine if the patient is eligible for intravenous thrombolysis or mechanical thrombectomy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intravenous thrombolytic therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alteplase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alteplase</a> (recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator or rt-PA) improves outcomes in patients with acute ischemic stroke who can be treated within 3 to 4.5 hours from stroke onset and meet additional eligibility criteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F71462\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71462 \">table 4</a>). This issue is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-reperfusion-therapy-for-acute-ischemic-stroke#H2187332181\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to reperfusion therapy for acute ischemic stroke&quot;, section on 'Alteplase'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early treatment with intra-arterial mechanical thrombectomy using a second-generation stent retriever device improves outcomes for patients with ischemic stroke caused by a large artery occlusion in the proximal anterior circulation. This therapy also is reviewed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanical-thrombectomy-for-acute-ischemic-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanical thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">DETERMINING A PRESUMPTIVE DIAGNOSIS OF STROKE SUBTYPE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After completing the initial assessment, the goal of the subsequent evaluation is to determine the underlying pathophysiology of the stroke in order to guide therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F69907\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69907 \">table 1</a>). This part of the discussion assumes that patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage have already been identified by the initial history and physical examination and noncontrast head CT (with or without lumbar puncture). A review of the clinical features and diagnosis of subarachnoid hemorrhage is found separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aneurysmal-subarachnoid-hemorrhage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition, the presence of intracerebral hemorrhage should already be evident by this phase of the evaluation; the diagnostic evaluation in these patients is reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"#H43\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation of patients with intracerebral hemorrhage'</a> below.)</p><p>In practice, then, this second stage of evaluation is focused upon distinguishing between embolic and thrombotic strokes; in patients with the latter, it is worth differentiating between large vessel and small vessel (penetrating artery or lacunar) infarcts since the causes, outcomes, and treatments are different. Some patients will have more than one potential etiology for stroke, although the majority will have only one predominant cause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-evaluation-of-stroke/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

In the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET), of patients with 70 to 99 percent stenosis who subsequently had an ischemic stroke, 20 and 45 percent of strokes that occurred in the territory of symptomatic and asymptomatic carotid arteries, respectively, were unrelated to carotid stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-evaluation-of-stroke/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of features in the clinical history may be useful in determining the type of stroke:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical course</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ecology</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Previous transient ischemic attack (TIA)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Activity at the onset or just before the stroke</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Associated symptoms</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical course</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most important historical item for differentiating stroke subtypes is the pace and course of the symptoms and signs and their clearing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-evaluation-of-stroke/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

Suspicion of the former typically arises once vascular pathology in a large vessel has been identified (eg, with noninvasive testing). Repetitive spells within a single vascular territory are also suggestive of an artery-to-artery source, as is a normal echocardiogram. However, caution must be used in interpreting the results of a transthoracic echocardiogram. As previously mentioned, this study can exclude a cardiomyopathy and most atrial and mitral valve pathology, but may miss other potential embolic sources such as clot in the atrial appendage, a patent foramen ovale, mitral valve lesions, and aortic atherosclerosis.

Vascular imaging (CTA or MRA) can be performed at the same time as brain imaging (CT or MRI) to exclude occlusion of the parent feeding artery, a condition that can mimic a lacunar infarct.

Extracranial vascular testing can be performed with MRA, CTA, or duplex carotid ultrasound. All are reliable and specific for detecting important severe occlusive lesions in the extracranial carotid arteries. Ultrasound devices such as color-flow Doppler imaging and power Doppler improve the resolution and quantification of carotid artery lesions.

Both MRA and CTA accurately define abnormalities within the carotid and vertebral arteries in the neck and their intracranial branches.

In addition, we suggest ambulatory cardiac monitoring for several weeks (eg, 30 days) for patients with a cryptogenic ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA). These patients are characterized by brain ischemia not attributable to a definite source of cardioembolism, large artery atherosclerosis, or small artery disease despite extensive vascular and cardiac evaluation, including no evidence of AF on standard 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) and 24-hour cardiac monitoring (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cryptogenic-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cryptogenic stroke&quot;</a>). The problem is that paroxysmal AF, if transient, infrequent, and largely asymptomatic, may be undetected on standard cardiac monitoring such as continuous telemetry and 24- or 48-hour Holter monitors.
