The adult human body contains at least one trillion endothelial cells, which weigh more than 100 g and cover a surface area of more than 3000 square meters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-endothelium-a-primer/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. They therefore constitute a distributed organ that forms a dynamic interface with all other organs in the body.</p><p>The endothelium mediates vasomotor tone, regulates cellular and nutrient trafficking, maintains blood fluidity, contributes to the local balance between pro- and anti-inflammatory mediators as well as procoagulant and anticoagulant activity, participates in generation of new blood vessels, orchestrates organ development, participates in innate and acquired immunity, interacts with circulating blood cells, and undergoes programmed cell death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-endothelium-a-primer/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Each of these activities is dynamically regulated in both space and time. Because endothelial cells receive cues from a wide variety of cells and tissues, they possess disparate properties that are specific to their local environment. Other phenotypic differences between endothelial cells are &quot;locked in&quot; by site-specific epigenetic mechanisms. Phenotypic heterogeneity is a central feature of the endothelium, and includes variations in morphology, biosynthetic repertoire, and behavior [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-endothelium-a-primer/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Here we review some of the general features of the endothelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-endothelium-a-primer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Organ-specific considerations, which are presented separately, include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The cardiovascular system &ndash;

Limitations to studying ECs in vivo include the absence of effective imaging techniques, the dearth of suitable biomarkers reflecting their biologic behavior, and their distinct structural and functional heterogeneity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1854496\"><span class=\"h1\">ENDOTHELIAL HETEROGENEITY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1854504\"><span class=\"h2\">Complex signaling patterns</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endothelial cells (ECs) receive and respond to signals from both surrounding cells and tissues, and flowing blood. Afferent signals are provided by soluble mediators, cell contacts, changes in oxygenation, hemodynamic forces, temperature, and pH. Efferent responses modulate vasomotor tone, vascular permeability, hemostatic balance, inflammatory signals, as well as cellular proliferation and survival. The response of the EC to a given stimulus may vary dramatically from one vascular bed to another.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1854511\"><span class=\"h2\">Structural specializations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In different vascular beds, ECs develop discrete ultrastructural specializations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-endothelium-a-primer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In the central nervous system, for example, the endothelium is &quot;continuous&quot; with complex tight junctions that form the blood-brain barrier. ECs in the endocrine glands and renal glomeruli are &quot;fenestrated,&quot; with transcellular pores that permit hormone protein secretion and plasma filtration. ECs that allow the exchange of cells or particles are &quot;discontinuous&quot;, displaying gaps between adjacent cells and poorly formed underlying basement membrane; these cells typify sinusoids of the liver, spleen, and bone marrow.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1854527\"><span class=\"h2\">Temporal variations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a given vascular bed, EC properties differ from one moment to the next as they respond to physiologic and pathophysiologic stimuli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-endothelium-a-primer/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>]. Both spatial and temporal heterogeneity contribute to the frequently focal nature of vasculopathic disease states.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1854534\"><span class=\"h2\">Changing synthetic repertoires</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Advances in genomics and proteomics have uncovered an expansive array of site-specific properties of the endothelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-endothelium-a-primer/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>]. These characteristics reflect differences in programs of protein synthesis, and result from specific signals that originate in the surrounding cells and tissues.</p><p>The following three examples show how this variability may be clinically relevant:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Anatomic variation</strong> &ndash; The <span class=\"nowrap\">procoagulant/anticoagulant</span> balance appears to differ between the endothelium of the venous valvular sinus and vein lumen, with the valvular sinus endothelium displaying decreased expression of von Willebrand factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-endothelium-a-primer/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vascular bed variation</strong> &ndash; In patients with thrombotic thrombocytopenia purpura (TTP), differences in vascular endothelial damage might reflect the fact that CD36, the thrombospondin receptor, is found on human microvascular ECs (HMVEC), but not ECs of large (umbilical) vessels (HUVEC).

This expression increased significantly following exposure of the mild SCD mouse models to one cycle of <span class=\"nowrap\">hypoxia/reoxygenation,</span> converting the phenotype to that of the severe SCD mouse.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1854541\"><span class=\"h1\">PATTERNS OF CHANGE IN ENDOTHELIAL FUNCTION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1854549\"><span class=\"h2\">EC activation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Originally, the term &quot;endothelial cell activation&quot; was based on the observation that cultured endothelial cells (ECs) demonstrated increased leukocyte adhesion following exposure to inflammatory mediators. The term was expanded later to embrace a wider spectrum of phenotypic changes, including decreased thromboresistance, altered vasomotor tone, and loss of barrier function. According to this paradigm, quiescent ECs display a thromboresistant, anti-adhesive and vasodilatory phenotype, whereas activated ECs have procoagulant, pro-adhesive, and vasoconstricting properties.</p><p>However, to avoid oversimplification with regard to the state of EC activation, it is important to remember the following points:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The phenotypic spectrum of ECs is a dynamic continuum.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Activation for one type of EC may not meet the definition of activation at another site. For example, non-inflamed skin venules express P-selectin constitutively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-endothelium-a-primer/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], whereas venules from other sites (eg, the mesentery) express P-selectin only when activated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inflammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, thrombin, and lipopolysaccharide may have distinct or only partially overlapping effects on EC phenotypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-endothelium-a-primer/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>EC activation is not an all-or-nothing response, nor is it necessarily linked to disease. Normal endothelium is highly responsive to alterations in the local extracellular milieu. Such environmental changes might occur in the setting of transient bacteremia, minor trauma, and other common stresses (eg, small temperature changes, proteolytic activity, and shear stress), and can be transient and mild or sustained and severe.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1854563\"><span class=\"h2\">EC dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initially, EC dysfunction referred to EC structural changes, loss of integrity, or hyper-adhesiveness of the vascular lining toward platelets as might be seen in atherosclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-endothelium-a-primer/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. Over time, the term came to reflect the loss of the endothelium's ability to regulate vascular resistance. More recently, the term EC dysfunction has been broadly applied to states in which the EC phenotype, whether or not it meets the definition of activation, poses a net liability to the host. Examples include severe sepsis (see <a href=\"#H1854605\" class=\"local\">'Severe sepsis'</a> below), pulmonary hypertension, pathological angiogenesis, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, hepatic veno-occlusive disease, and sickle cell disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1854578\"><span class=\"h2\">Nitric oxide production</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The principal physiologic stimulus for endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthesis is blood flow-induced shear stress, a process termed &quot;flow-mediated vasodilatation.&quot; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coronary-artery-endothelial-dysfunction-basic-concepts#H359037870\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coronary artery endothelial dysfunction: Basic concepts&quot;, section on 'Nitric oxide function'</a>.) In addition, a variety of agonists, including acetylcholine, histamine, thrombin, serotonin, adenosine diphosphate, bradykinin, and norepinephrine, can increase the synthesis and release of NO. These agonists result in vasorelaxation when the endothelium is intact, and vasoconstriction if the endothelium is removed or perturbed.</p><p>NO has a number of other effects. It inhibits platelet adhesion and aggregation, an effect that may be synergistic with that of prostacyclin. NO blocks monocyte adhesion to the endothelium. NO also reduces endotoxin- and cytokine-induced expression of tissue factor, thus modulating the prothrombotic potential of the endothelial cell.</p><p>Paradoxical vasoconstriction of coronary arteries induced by acetylcholine was described in early and advanced human atherosclerosis. The current belief is that an abnormal vascular response to acetylcholine may represent a defect in EC vasodilator function, due at least in part to reduced EC production of NO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-endothelium-a-primer/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1854585\"><span class=\"h2\">Leukocyte adhesion to endothelium</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A pathophysiologic link has been made between inducible endothelial-leukocyte adhesion molecules and atherosclerosis (so-called athero-ELAMs) via the identification of an inducible endothelial cell-specific antigen that binds predominantly to monocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-endothelium-a-primer/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Peptide sequencing revealed homology to the predicted sequence of human vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1, which had been previously cloned as a cytokine-inducible protein in endothelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-endothelium-a-primer/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Subsequently, VCAM-1 was localized to the endothelium overlying atherosclerotic lesions in a hyperlipidemic rabbit model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-endothelium-a-primer/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>] and was shown to be a risk factor for venous thrombosis in a kindred with protein C deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-endothelium-a-primer/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. These observations not only emphasized the role of endothelial dysfunction as a primary determinant of atherosclerosis, but also helped to refocus research and development on the inflammatory nature of this disease process.</p><p>Additional details regarding leukocyte-endothelial interactions in the pathogenesis of inflammation are presented separately.

Sepsis is a common and often fatal disorder in which changes in endothelial function play a central role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-endothelium-a-primer/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. The assault on the endothelium occurs on three separate fronts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-endothelium-a-primer/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pathogens may directly infect endothelial cells (ECs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-endothelium-a-primer/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Components of the bacterial cell wall (eg, lipopolysaccharide [LPS]) may activate pattern recognition receptors on the surface of the EC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-endothelium-a-primer/abstract/33-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Host-derived products (eg, complement, cytokines, chemokines, serine proteases, fibrin, activated platelets and leukocytes, elevated glucose, reactive oxygen species or hypoxia-induced factors, and hemodynamic changes) may activate ECs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-endothelium-a-primer/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p/><p>The endothelium responds to these stresses in ways that differ according to the nature of the pathogen, host genetics, underlying comorbidity, age, gender, and the location of the vascular bed. These responses may include structural changes, such as nuclear vacuolization, cytoplasmic swelling, cytoplasmic fragmentation, denudation, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> detachment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-endothelium-a-primer/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. However, functional changes in the endothelium are even more common and include shifts in hemostatic balance, increased leukocyte adhesion and trafficking, altered vasomotor tone, loss of barrier function, and programmed cell death.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1854652\"><span class=\"h2\">Procoagulant properties</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inflammatory mediators may interact with ECs to induce a loss of the normal thromboresistant phenotype. In cultured endothelial cells, addition of bacterial lipopolysaccharide <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cytokines results in a series of procoagulant responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-endothelium-a-primer/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>] including decreased synthesis of thrombomodulin (TM), tissue-type plasminogen activator and heparan sulfate, increased expression of tissue factor (TF) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), and generation of procoagulant microparticles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-endothelium-a-primer/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>In whole animal models of sepsis, however, the endothelium does not express detectable TF with the possible exception of the spleen and aorta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-endothelium-a-primer/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. Moreover, while the association of sepsis and decreased levels of TM has been confirmed in the skin vasculature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-endothelium-a-primer/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>], this phenomenon does not apply to all vascular beds. ECs of the blood brain barrier, for example, do not normally express TM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-endothelium-a-primer/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>In vivo, properties of ECs that may contribute to the sepsis-associated procoagulant state include recruitment of platelets, monocytes, and neutrophils, all of which are capable of initiating or amplifying coagulation; cell surface translocation of anionic phospholipids that enhance the binding of coagulation complexes; increased exposure of subendothelium (eg, collagen, fibronectin, fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor), which may serve as attachment sites for platelets as ECs undergo apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-endothelium-a-primer/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-and-acquired-disorders-of-platelet-function#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital and acquired disorders of platelet function&quot;, section on 'Platelet adherence'</a>); and development of a low flow state, as a result of reduced cardiac output, vasoconstriction, or occlusive lesions, leading to reduced clearance of activated procoagulant serine proteases, thus promoting additional clotting.</p><p>Evidence that increased endothelial cell anticoagulant activity can reverse the coagulopathy associated with LPS administration comes from a transgenic mouse model. When either the leech anticoagulant hirudin or human tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) was expressed on endothelial cells, monocytes, and platelets, widespread intravascular thrombosis, thrombocytopenia, and coagulopathy were inhibited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-endothelium-a-primer/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. While it does not describe a clinically-relevant approach, this study supports the postulate that modulation of endothelial cell properties can modify the clinical expression of endotoxemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1854672\"><span class=\"h2\">Disseminated intravascular coagulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Virtually all patients with severe sepsis have activation of the coagulation cascade. Initiation of clotting is thought to reflect expression of tissue factor on the surface of activated monocytes and macrophages, with subsequent induction of increased thrombin generation, and fibrin formation. In the extreme, this leads to depletion of coagulation factors, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), and possible end-organ damage. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of disseminated intravascular coagulation in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The extent to which the above changes occur in the intact endothelium is not entirely clear. As with other properties of the endothelium, the hemostatic balance is differentially regulated among the various vascular beds. In a baboon sepsis model, for example, administration of lethal doses of E. coli resulted in increased fibrin deposition in the marginal zone and sinusoids of the spleen, hepatic sinusoids, glomeruli, and peritubular vessels of the kidney, but little or no fibrin in the portal vessels of the liver, cerebral cortex, skin, myocardium, or aorta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-endothelium-a-primer/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. These results, and similar data obtained in mouse models of sepsis, point to a predilection for organ-specific coagulation in sepsis. Their clinical relevance is supported by studies of cerebral malaria in which malaria-associated depletion of endothelial protein C receptor (EPCR), with subsequent impairment of the protein C system, promotes a proinflammatory, procoagulant state in brain microvessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-endothelium-a-primer/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1854692\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic influences</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In mice with genetically determined hypercoagulable states, sepsis results in a marked shift in hemostatic balance in ways that differ between vascular beds. For example, in mice that carry a thrombomodulin (TM) gene mutation, disruption of the TM-dependent activation of protein C via the administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) resulted in higher levels of fibrin deposition in the lung and kidney, but not the brain, compared with wild-type mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-endothelium-a-primer/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. In contrast, in heterozygous antithrombin-deficient mice, LPS challenge resulted in increased deposition of fibrin in the kidney, liver, and heart [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-endothelium-a-primer/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. These studies demonstrate the importance of underlying genetics in the sepsis phenotype.

These alterations are particularly prominent on post-capillary venules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-endothelium-a-primer/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>], and result in increased rolling, adherence, and transmigration of leukocytes into underlying tissue.
