While both are characterized by elevated left ventricular filling pressures, the underlying hemodynamic processes differ considerably. These differences can be best understood when described in terms of the left ventricular pressure-volume and other hemodynamic relationships that provide patient-specific insight regarding the basis of cardiac dysfunction. Understanding these principles has practical implications for the treatment of patients with heart failure, first by defining the predominant type of hemodynamic abnormality (eg, systolic versus diastolic dysfunction) and second, by clarifying filling pressures, loading conditions, and vascular resistances that can be important in determining the most effective therapeutic approach. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-therapy-of-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the therapy of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">NORMAL LEFT VENTRICULAR PRESSURE-VOLUME RELATIONSHIP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As a pump, the ventricle generates pressure (to eject blood) and displaces a volume of blood. The normal relationship between left ventricular pressure generation and ejection can be expressed as a plot of left ventricular pressure versus left ventricular volume (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F73169\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73169 \">figure 1</a>). At end&ndash;diastole, the fibers have a particular stretch or length, which is determined by the resting force, myocardial compliance, and the degree of filling from the left atrium. This distending force is the preload of the muscle.</p><p>After depolarization, the ventricle generates pressure isovolumically (without any change in volume), which leads to the opening of the aortic valve and the ejection of blood. Up to this point, the course of systolic pressure is related to the force created by the myocardium. The magnitude of this force is a function of both chamber pressure and volume. During ejection, the myocardium must also sustain a particular force, which is a function of the resistance and capacitance of the circulatory vasculature and is called the afterload.</p><p>The volume of ejected blood represents the forward effective stroke volume of systolic contraction. At end&ndash;ejection, the aortic valve closes followed by isovolumic relaxation, as left ventricular pressure falls while volume remains constant. When pressure falls sufficiently, the mitral valve opens and left ventricular diastolic filling begins (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F73169\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73169 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Thus, the three major determinants of the left ventricular forward stroke <span class=\"nowrap\">volume/performance</span> are the preload (venous return and end&ndash;diastolic volume), myocardial contractility (the force generated at any given end&ndash;diastolic volume), and the afterload (aortic impedance and wall stress) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-left-ventricular-pressure-volume-and-other-hemodynamic-relationships/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Preload</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Landmark studies by Frank and Starling established the relationship between ventricular end&ndash;diastolic volume (preload) and ventricular performance (stroke volume, cardiac output, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> stroke work). Subsequent studies have shown that the isovolumetric force at any given contractile state is a function of the degree of end&ndash;diastolic fiber stretch. These mechanical characteristics of contraction are based upon the ultrastructure of cardiac muscle. Increasing sarcomere length up to a point increases the area of overlap between actin filaments and portions of the myosin filaments containing force&ndash;generating cross&ndash;bridges, thereby allowing increased tension development (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F63547\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63547 \">figure 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-left-ventricular-pressure-volume-and-other-hemodynamic-relationships/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Thus, there is an augmentation of developed force as end&ndash;diastolic volume and fiber length increase. The left ventricle normally functions on the ascending limb of this force&ndash;length relationship.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Contractility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The stroke volume at any given fiber length is also a function of contractility, as variations in contractility create nonparallel shifts in the developed force&ndash;length relation. Each myocardial cell is capable of varying the amount of tension generated during contraction. This tension is a function of the amount of calcium bound to a regulatory site on the troponin complex of the myofilaments. The amount of calcium available is in turn a function of intracellular calcium delivery.</p><p>Drug therapy can alter the developed force-length relation. For example, the administration of norepinephrine stimulates cardiac adrenergic receptors, which increase myocardial cell cyclic adenosine monophosphate levels, thereby raising the intracellular calcium concentration and contractility. As a result, the ventricle is able to develop a greater force from any given fiber length. Administration of a beta blocker, on the other hand, attenuates the slope of the force&ndash;length relation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Afterload</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A third element determining ventricular performance is the impedance during ejection, the afterload. The afterload on the shortening fibers is defined as the force per unit area acting in the direction in which these fibers are arranged in the ventricular wall. This constitutes the wall stress and can be estimated by applying Laplace's Law [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-left-ventricular-pressure-volume-and-other-hemodynamic-relationships/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Changes in ventricular volume and wall thickness, as well as aortic pressure or aortic impedance, determine the afterload. As an example, elevations in systolic pressure act to reduce the ejected fraction of stroke volume from any particular diastolic volume.</p><p>This relationship can be viewed as a type of feedback control of myocardial contraction. A primary increment in stroke volume, for example, leads to an increase in aortic impedance. As a result of this rise in afterload, subsequent contractions have an attenuated stroke volume. If, on the other hand, an increment in aortic impedance is the initial event, the accompanying reduction in stroke volume should lead to a greater end&ndash;ejection and end&ndash;diastolic chamber volume. The ensuing prolongation of fiber length should restore stroke volume to the baseline level.</p><p>Stroke volume is only minimally altered by changes in afterload in the normal heart. In comparison, the failing heart is progressively more afterload-dependent and small changes in afterload can produce large changes in stroke volume (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F55742\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55742 \">figure 3</a>). Reducing afterload in patients with heart failure via the administration of angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, or direct vasodilators (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydralazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydralazine</a>) has the dual advantage of increasing cardiac output and, over the long term, slowing the rate of loss of myocardial function. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-therapy-of-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the therapy of heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PRESSURE-VOLUME RELATIONSHIPS IN HEART FAILURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systolic and diastolic dysfunction of the left ventricle can be understood by analysis of the relationships between left ventricular developed pressure and volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-left-ventricular-pressure-volume-and-other-hemodynamic-relationships/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Systolic dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term &ldquo;systolic dysfunction&rdquo; refers to a decrease in myocardial contractility. As a result, the slope of the relationship between initial length and developed force is reduced (as in the beta blocker example above) and the curve is shifted to the right. This shift is associated with a reduction in stroke volume and, consequently, cardiac output. The fall in cardiac output leads to increased sympathetic activity, which helps to restore cardiac output by increasing both contractility and heart rate. The fall in cardiac output also promotes renal salt and water retention, leading to expansion of the blood volume, thereby raising end&ndash;diastolic pressure and volume, which, via the Frank-Starling relationship, enhances ventricular performance and tends to restore the stroke volume (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F58693\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58693 \">figure 4</a>). Left ventricular hypertrophy is also part of the adaptive response to systolic dysfunction, since it unloads individual muscle fibers and thereby decreases wall stress and afterload.</p><p>As systolic heart failure progresses, a series of Frank-Starling curves may be seen due to the progressive decline in the maximal cardiac output generated for any given cardiac filling pressure. Flattening of the Frank-Starling curve in advanced disease means that changes in venous return <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (LVEDP) now fail to increase stroke volume (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F58693\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58693 \">figure 4</a>). Two factors may contribute to a plateau in the pressure-volume curve:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The heart may simply have reached its maximum capacity to increase contractility in response to increasing stretch. In vitro studies suggest that this abnormality may result from decreased calcium affinity for and therefore binding to troponin C and from decreased calcium availability within the myocardial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-left-ventricular-pressure-volume-and-other-hemodynamic-relationships/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. These abnormalities may result in part from lengthening of the sarcomeres to a point that exceeds the optimal degree of overlap of thick and thin myofilaments, thereby preventing developed force from increasing in response to increasing load.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Frank-Starling relationship actually applies to left ventricular end-diastolic volume, since it is the stretching of cardiac muscle that is responsible for the enhanced contractility. The more easily measured LVEDP is used clinically since, in relatively normal hearts, pressure and volume vary in parallel. However, cardiac compliance may be reduced with heart disease. As a result, a small increase in volume may produce a large elevation in LVEDP, but no substantial stretching of the cardiac muscle and therefore little change in cardiac output [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-left-ventricular-pressure-volume-and-other-hemodynamic-relationships/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p>The plateau in the Frank-Starling curve also represents a reduction in the heart's systolic reserve. As a result, the ability of positive inotropic agents to shift this relation to the left and permit greater shortening becomes impaired. In terms of the pressure&ndash;volume plot, the systolic pressure&ndash;volume loop is &quot;right&ndash;shifted&quot; with a reduced slope representing the decreased contractility. In contrast, the diastolic pressure&ndash;volume loop is normal initially, although the patient with systolic dysfunction begins at a point farther right on the curve because of the increase in left ventricular volume produced by cardiac dilatation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F79423\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79423 \">figure 5</a>).</p><p>However, decreased compliance due to hypertrophy and fibrosis may eventually produce disturbed diastolic function in many patients with advanced heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-left-ventricular-pressure-volume-and-other-hemodynamic-relationships/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In this setting, there is also an upward&ndash;shift in the end&ndash;diastolic pressure&ndash;volume relationship, as a higher pressure is required to achieve the same volume.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Diastolic dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With pure diastolic heart failure, left ventricular end&ndash;systolic volume and stroke volume are preserved. There is, however, an abnormal increase in left ventricular diastolic pressure at any given volume. This reflects a decrease in left ventricular diastolic dispensability (or compliance) such that a higher diastolic pressure is required to achieve the same diastolic volume or contractility. In a pressure&ndash;volume plot, diastolic dysfunction would therefore be characterized by a normal systolic pressure volume loop and an &quot;upward&ndash;shift&quot; of the diastolic pressure&ndash;volume loop without a change in end-diastolic volume (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F79423\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79423 \">figure 5</a>).
