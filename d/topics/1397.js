NSAID challenge protocols involve cautiously administering gradually increasing doses of an NSAID, usually <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, in an appropriately monitored medical setting. These procedures are used to diagnose NSAID pseudoallergy and also to desensitize AERD patients to NSAIDs, when indicated. The safety and technical aspects of these protocols, as well as the efficacy of aspirin therapy for AERD, are discussed here. The clinical manifestations and management of AERD and a general discussion of allergic and pseudoallergic reactions to NSAIDs are reviewed separately.

In addition, there are several types of NSAID reactions, and determining which type is likely present can require some expertise. In some centers (especially in Europe), pulmonary and otolaryngology specialists perform NSAID challenges. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nsaids-including-aspirin-allergic-and-pseudoallergic-reactions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;NSAIDs (including aspirin): Allergic and pseudoallergic reactions&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14131210\"><span class=\"h2\">Safety</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Challenges in patients with suspected type 1 pseudoallergy are provocative challenges, meaning that they are likely to induce symptoms, albeit in a controlled and limited manner. These protocols differ from most other types of drug challenges (particularly those for immunoglobulin E-mediated allergic reactions, such as anaphylaxis), which are performed only on patients who are <strong>not</strong> believed to be allergic, in order to confirm <strong>lack</strong> of allergy.</p><p>Because NSAID challenges in AERD are likely to provoke symptoms, the following precautions are necessary:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Challenges should be performed in a medically-monitored setting. In most cases, these protocols may be safely performed in specially equipped outpatient allergy clinics, although the decision about where to perform challenges requires clinical judgment, and each case must be considered individually.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient's asthma should be well-controlled, because NSAID challenges may induce wheezing and bronchospasm.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many published drug challenge protocols call for obtaining intravenous access prior to challenge as a precaution in case intravenous IV medications or fluids are required. However, while this is the common practice, neither the author nor editors of this topic have needed to administer intravenous fluids or medications to a patient with AERD undergoing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> challenge.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Informed consent should be obtained.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14131255\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications for challenge</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>NSAID challenge protocols are performed either to diagnose NSAID pseudoallergy or to desensitize the patient to NSAIDs in order to administer NSAIDs on a regular basis.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Diagnosis of NSAID pseudoallergy</strong> &ndash; There are no in vitro or skin testing methods available to diagnose NSAID pseudoallergy, and a provocative challenge procedure is the only means of obtaining a definitive diagnosis. In patients with AERD, an NSAID challenge that results in characteristic nasal, ocular, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> respiratory symptoms is diagnostic of type 1 pseudoallergy. However, outside of research settings, challenges are uncommonly performed solely for the purpose of diagnosis, as they are not without risk to the patient.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Desensitization to NSAIDs</strong> &ndash; Desensitization is performed by extending the challenge procedure beyond the initial induction of symptoms. Desensitization is commonly (although not exclusively) performed with oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>. Successful aspirin desensitization induces a state of temporary tolerance to NSAIDs, which can be maintained indefinitely as long as the patient continues to take aspirin or another NSAID on a daily basis. This can be useful in several clinical scenarios. (See <a href=\"#H13003361\" class=\"local\">'Desensitization'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14131280\"><span class=\"h2\">Contraindications to challenge</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is essential that any concurrent cardiopulmonary conditions are under optimal control before a patient is challenged.</p><p>In the author's clinic, we perform oral challenges on patients with asthma only if the prebronchodilator forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) is &ge;70 percent of the patient's best and &ge;1.5 L.

If the patient is already taking an LTMD, then it is continued through the procedure.</p><p>LTMDs significantly impact the results of oral NSAID challenge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspirin-exacerbated-respiratory-disease-nsaid-challenge-and-desensitization/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. Before LTMDs became available, NSAID challenges were routinely performed in intensive care units because of the severe asthmatic and sometimes systemic symptoms (eg, hypotension) that could develop in highly sensitive patients. However, LTMDs blunt the severity of NSAIDs pseudoallergic reactions, allowing these procedures to be performed safely in properly equipped outpatient settings.</p><p>Large observational studies comparing patients challenged with LTMD premedication, with historical controls challenged without LTMD premedication show that patients undergoing oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> (acetylsalicylic acid [ASA]) challenge while taking LTMDs demonstrate fewer and less severe episodes of bronchospasm, while nasal and ocular symptoms remain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspirin-exacerbated-respiratory-disease-nsaid-challenge-and-desensitization/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].

The symptoms are essentially shifted from the lower airway to the upper airway. Montelukast and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zafirlukast-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zafirlukast</a> do not mask the reactions in oral challenges altogether, and symptoms are still detectable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspirin-exacerbated-respiratory-disease-nsaid-challenge-and-desensitization/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. There is less experience with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zileuton-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zileuton</a>, and this agent may suppress symptoms to a greater degree.

Particularly for patients suspected of having AERD, the index of suspicion for the condition is usually highly based on history alone, and placebos are rarely needed.</p><p>In contrast, placebo doses are <strong>essential</strong> in research studies in which challenge is performed for the purposes of confirming the diagnosis. Many protocols include an initial day in which only placebos are administered to control for nonspecific changes in pulmonary function that can occur as the day progresses.</p><p>There are some situations in which the use of placebo doses is clinically useful. For example, placebo doses are helpful in the evaluation of the patient who is suspected of not having NSAID sensitivity at all, in whom challenge is indicated to prove that the patient tolerates NSAIDs. We sometimes give such patients an initial dose of placebos and also end the challenge with one or more placebo doses (so that the patient receives placebo when expecting the largest dose of the day). Informed consent should be obtained for the general inclusion of placebos, although the patient is obviously not told when in the protocol the placebo will be given.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23255555\"><span class=\"h3\">Procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A sample oral challenge protocol used at the author's institution is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F70867\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70867 \">table 1</a>). This protocol uses commercially available <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> tablets, with lower doses obtained by cutting an 81 mg tablet with a pill cutter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspirin-exacerbated-respiratory-disease-nsaid-challenge-and-desensitization/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Doses are given at three-hour intervals, up to a maximum dose of 325 mg. These protocols are carried out over one to two consecutive days.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A starting dose of 40.5 mg is suggested in most cases. This is based on a study in which 420 patients with AERD were challenged with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, and 75 percent reacted after the administration of either the 45 or 60 mg dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspirin-exacerbated-respiratory-disease-nsaid-challenge-and-desensitization/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some experts suggest that the time interval between doses can be shortened to 90 minutes unless the patient specifically reports that symptoms began more than 90 minutes after ingestion during past reactions. It is our clinical impression that a significant subset of patients with type 1 pseudoallergic reactions develops symptoms approximately two hours after administration. For this reason, it is our practice to wait three hours between doses.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One study evaluated an even faster protocol involving hourly dosing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspirin-exacerbated-respiratory-disease-nsaid-challenge-and-desensitization/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, AERD was not confirmed in this patient population prior to challenge, and the author's experience suggests that many AERD patients react after 60 minutes, such that higher rates of more severe reactions would be observed if this protocol were applied to larger numbers of patients. Thus, we favor longer time periods between doses.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23255435\"><span class=\"h3\">Provocation of symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The criteria used to determine a positive oral challenge are shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F71124\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71124 \">table 2</a>). Most patients with AERD and pseudoallergic reactions to NSAIDs develop symptoms in response to a dose between 60 and 100 mg. Premedication with an LTMD dramatically reduces the pulmonary symptoms seen during challenge, although nasal and ocular symptoms remain.

If the challenge was performed to diagnose type 1 pseudoallergy, then the procedure should be repeated without LTMDs. If the procedure was done to both diagnose and desensitize the patient to aspirin, a practical approach is to continue the patient on aspirin (650 mg twice daily) for up to three months.

Once the patient has developed symptoms and these have been treated, the challenge is resumed by repeating the same dose that elicited the reaction. If there is another reaction, the symptoms are again treated, and the same dose is given again until there is no further reaction. Once the patient no longer reacts to that dose, the protocol is continued until the patient has ingested a full 325 mg dose without developing symptoms. At this point, the patient is desensitized. AERD patients who have been successfully desensitized to 325 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> can subsequently increase the dose themselves at home. We believe this approach to be safe, because in over 600 consecutive desensitizations to aspirin, we have not seen a reaction to 650 mg of aspirin once a patient is desensitized to 325 mg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspirin-exacerbated-respiratory-disease-nsaid-challenge-and-desensitization/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>The issue of whether to repeat the provoking dose in patients with mild reactions, rather than simply continuing the protocol with the next higher dose, has not been investigated.

A desensitized patient can also change from one NSAID to another without losing tolerance.

During this period, aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid [ASA]) or the desired NSAID can be reintroduced without a reaction.

Patients should be counseled that they will remain tolerant to aspirin as long as they are compliant with the daily dose.

The effects on rhinosinusitis symptoms are usually more dramatic than the pulmonary effects. It typically takes at least three months to see the effects of therapy. In contrast to patients with aspirin intolerance, those with chronic rhinosinusitis and nasal polyps but who tolerate aspirin, do <strong>not</strong> appear to benefit from daily aspirin therapy, at least at moderate doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspirin-exacerbated-respiratory-disease-nsaid-challenge-and-desensitization/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a small randomized crossover trial involving 25 patients with AERD, subjects were desensitized to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and then treated with daily aspirin or placebo for three months, and then crossed over to the other intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspirin-exacerbated-respiratory-disease-nsaid-challenge-and-desensitization/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

Primary outcomes included nasal symptoms, Sino-Nasal Outcomes Test (SNOT20) scores, peak nasal inspiratory flows, Asthma Control Test (ACT) scores, and spirometric parameters. Only patients with AERD who received aspirin therapy showed statistically significant improvements in these measures. Maintenance dose of inhaled glucocorticoids also decreased in the AERD group receiving aspirin. In addition to demonstrating improvement with aspirin therapy, these findings support the clinical observation that patients without aspirin intolerance do not appear to benefit from aspirin therapy. Of note, the dose of aspirin used in this trial was relatively low, as some centers use 650 mg twice daily or even higher doses.

NSAID challenges are used to confirm the diagnosis of pseudoallergy. These same challenges can be extended to achieve desensitization to NSAIDs. NSAID desensitization allows patients with AERD and type 1 pseudoallergy to safely take any NSAID, provided it is continued on a daily basis. (See <a href=\"#H13003220\" class=\"local\">'Overview of NSAID challenge'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Desensitization and daily <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> or NSAID therapy may be indicated for several reasons, including treatment of the upper and lower respiratory manifestations of AERD, treatment of rheumatologic disorders, pain management, or antiplatelet therapy. (See <a href=\"#H14131255\" class=\"local\">'Indications for challenge'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whenever possible, NSAID challenge <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> desensitization should be performed by an allergy specialist with experience in diagnosing and managing drug adverse reactions. (See <a href=\"#H14131689\" class=\"local\">'Referral'</a> above and <a href=\"#H14131210\" class=\"local\">'Safety'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Both oral and inhalational (either nasal or bronchial) NSAID challenge procedures have been developed for diagnosing pseudoallergy reactions to NSAIDs. However, only oral protocols have been used for desensitization:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> <span class=\"nowrap\">challenge/desensitization</span> has been the approach in the United States (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F70867\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70867 \">table 1</a>), although a hybrid protocol that begins with nasal administration of liquid <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketorolac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketorolac</a> and concludes with oral aspirin has been developed and offers some safety advantages (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F67707\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67707 \">table 3</a>). This is the author's preferred approach.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In Europe, a liquid preparation of aspirin-lysine (ASA-lysine) has been available for decades and most challenges are performed by inhalation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NSAID challenge procedures are expected to provoke symptoms, and the development of characteristic signs and symptoms confirms the diagnosis of a type 1 pseudoallergic reaction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F71124\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71124 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H13003235\" class=\"local\">'Types of challenges'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend that all patients with AERD be premedicated with a leukotriene-modifying drug (LTMD) before oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> <span class=\"nowrap\">challenge/desensitization</span> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=montelukast-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Montelukast</a> is commonly given in this setting. (See <a href=\"#H13003256\" class=\"local\">'Premedication'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Desensitization is accomplished by continuing the diagnostic challenge procedure. Symptoms are provoked and treated, and the provoking dose is then repeated until the patient no longer reacts to it. The patient is considered desensitized when 325 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> is tolerated. Aspirin desensitization is nearly always successful in patients with AERD. (See <a href=\"#H13003361\" class=\"local\">'Desensitization'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once desensitized, patients must take at least 325 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> daily to maintain the desensitized state. They are also cross-desensitized to other NSAIDs and can take these medications as well. However, if the dose of aspirin is reduced to 81 mg daily, cross-desensitization is usually lost. (See <a href=\"#H13003382\" class=\"local\">'Outcomes of desensitization'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with AERD and chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyposis who have nasal symptoms that are worsening despite LTMDs, topical corticosteroids, and other appropriate therapies, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> desensitization followed by daily aspirin therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> to treat AERD, we usually start with an aspirin dose of 650 mg twice daily. We evaluate the patient's response to therapy after three months. If symptoms are improved after three months, the dose may be lowered to 325 mg twice daily. (See <a href=\"#H14035446\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy of aspirin therapy in AERD'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/aspirin-exacerbated-respiratory-disease-nsaid-challenge-and-desensitization/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">White A, Bigby T, Stevenson D.
