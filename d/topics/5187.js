It is estimated that less than one-half of these cases will be diagnosed during the patient's lifetime as the disease is often clinically silent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-and-screening-for-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Approximately 78 percent of families with ADPKD have an abnormality on chromosome 16 (<em>PKD1</em> locus) that is tightly linked to the alpha-globin gene locus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-and-screening-for-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Most of the remaining families (14 percent) have a different defect that involves a gene on chromosome 4 (the <em>PKD2</em> locus). In approximately 8 percent of families, no mutation is detected. In small number of these families, mutations in <em>GANAB </em>encoding the glucosidase II alpha subunit have been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-and-screening-for-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Cysts occur later in PKD2 disease, as does end-stage renal disease (ESRD; mean age 74.0 versus 54.3 years in PKD1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-and-screening-for-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. As a result, false-negative results are more likely when screening young subjects with PKD2 disease.

Typical findings include large kidneys and extensive cysts scattered throughout both kidneys. Because of cost and safety, ultrasonography is most commonly used as the imaging modality. In certain settings, genetic testing is required for a definitive diagnosis.</p><p>Important issues related to the diagnosis of ADPKD include the presence or absence of a family history of the disease, the number and types of renal cysts, and the age of the patient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">POSITIVE FAMILY HISTORY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Screening and diagnosis of asymptomatic individuals</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Screening for the diagnosis of ADPKD in an asymptomatic individual at risk because of a positive family history usually relies upon imaging of the kidney. Among at-risk individuals, ultrasonography of the kidneys is usually the initial modality used for screening and diagnosis. Since this technique is less reliable in younger individuals, genetic diagnosis using linkage or DNA analysis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an alternative imaging modality can be performed when a definitive diagnosis is required. (See <a href=\"#H26467728\" class=\"local\">'Genetic testing'</a> below and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Other imaging modalities'</a> below.)</p><p>In children (less than 18 years of age), we recommend <strong>NOT</strong> screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-and-screening-for-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. This is principally because the adverse consequences associated with a positive diagnosis prior to symptoms in young individuals (such as career, educational, emotional, and insurability issues) far outweigh any benefits since effective therapies are not yet available. Nevertheless, children at risk for ADPKD should be monitored for early disease presentations that require treatment. Among these, hypertension is underrecognized.</p><p>In adults (greater than 18 years of age), we recommend screening in potential living, related kidney donors, given the adverse medical consequences of transplanting a kidney from a donor with ADPKD. It is important to realize, however, that all potential kidney donors undergo imaging of the kidneys. In other at-risk adults, the decision to screen for the disease should be based upon the patient's preferences and values after the benefits and adverse consequences of certainty concerning the diagnosis are fully understood.</p><p>Prior to testing, counseling by experienced staff must be performed. The benefits derived from testing include knowledge concerning the diagnosis, appropriate family planning, the ability to detect and treat complications associated with the disease, reassurance of unaffected individuals, and appropriate selection of unaffected relatives as possible donors for kidney transplantation. Adverse consequences with testing, including possible difficulties with insurability and employment due to a positive diagnosis, must be discussed.</p><p>There has been a trend for earlier diagnosis of ADPKD in patients at risk for the disease. In one cohort of patients, for example, the age at diagnosis was significantly lower among those born between 1951 and 1974 compared with those born before 1951 (27 versus 39 years, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-and-screening-for-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Ultrasonographic criteria for adults</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Renal ultrasonography is usually used for screening because it is safe, effective, and inexpensive. The criteria for diagnosis varies based upon whether the familial genotype is known because disease severity varies between the different genotypes. In the vast majority of cases, the individual at risk for ADPKD is from a family with an unknown genotype.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H77995158\"><span class=\"h4\">At risk but unknown familial genotype</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We use the following ultrasonographic criteria for the diagnosis of ADPKD for at-risk individuals from families of unknown genotype:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among individuals between 15 and 39 years of age, at least three unilateral or bilateral kidney cysts. The specificity and positive predictive value of this criterion for individuals of this age is 100 percent. By comparison, this criterion is associated with a sensitivity of 82 and 96 percent for individuals between 15 and 29 years and between 30 to 39 years of age, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among individuals 40 to 59 years of age, at least two cysts in each kidney. This finding is associated with a sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of 90, 100, and 100 percent, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among individuals 60 years or older, at least four cysts in each kidney. This is associated with 100 percent sensitivity and specificity.</p><p/><p>These criteria are based upon a well-designed study of 948 individuals at risk for either PKD1 or PKD2 who underwent renal ultrasound and subsequently underwent molecular genotyping [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-and-screening-for-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. A statistical resampling method termed &quot;bootstrapping&quot; was used to obtain the best estimate for the accuracy of different ultrasonographic diagnostic criteria for various age groups and also to ensure that the analysis involved a constant ratio of 85:15 of patients with PKD1 to those with PKD2. This latter feature was performed to simulate the case mix observed in a general clinic assessing at-risk individuals of all age groups.</p><p>These criteria were derived from examinations using conventional ultrasound scanners with the capability of detecting cysts 1 cm or more in diameter. Modern, high-resolution ultrasound scanners have better imaging resolution, enabling detection of renal cysts down to 2 to 3 mm.</p><p>A more recent study tested the diagnostic performance of high-resolution ultrasound compared with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) among 155 individuals ages 16 to 40 years who underwent molecular genotyping [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-and-screening-for-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Seventy-three individuals in the cohort were known to be genetically affected, 37 were at risk by virtue of family history of a known genetic mutation, and 45 were unaffected. Compared with results obtained in the study described above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-and-screening-for-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], among 37 individuals ages 16 to 29 years, three or more cysts demonstrated by high-resolution ultrasound had a higher diagnostic sensitivity (82 versus 97 percent, respectively) and a slightly decreased positive predictive value (100 versus 97 percent, respectively). Limitations of this study include the relatively small number of patients and the operator and center dependency of ultrasonography.</p><p>Nevertheless, this study provides some guidance concerning the ability of specific ultrasonographic findings using modern ultrasound scanners to exclude the diagnosis of ADPKD among at-risk individuals from families of unknown genotype:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among individuals 40 years of age or older, ultrasonographic evidence of zero or only one renal cyst excludes the disease since these findings are associated with a negative predictive value of 100 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among those 30 to 39 years of age, the disease is essentially excluded if ultrasonography reveals the absence of any renal cysts, which is associated with a false-negative rate of 2 percent. The finding of no renal cysts with more sensitive modalities, such as computed tomography (CT) scanning or MRI, would provide further support that the disease is not present. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Other imaging modalities'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients less than 30 years of age, ultrasonographic imaging is limited in its ability to help exclude the disease. The approach to such patients is discussed in other sections in this topic review. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Other imaging modalities'</a> below and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Approach after equivocal ultrasound results'</a> below and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Infant/child'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H129629707\"><span class=\"h4\">At risk for type 1 ADPKD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some asymptomatic patients at risk for ADPKD are from families with known and well-characterized pathogenic mutations in the <em>PKD1</em> locus. In this setting, testing for the known mutation is more definitive and may be more cost effective than ultrasonography.</p><p>However, if genetic testing is not available or less desirable, ultrasonographic imaging may be used for individuals who are known to be at risk for type 1 ADPKD. Among such patients, the following age-dependent ultrasonographic criteria have been used for the diagnosis: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among individuals between 15 and 30 years of age, at least two unilateral or bilateral cysts</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among individuals 30 to 59 years of age, two cysts in each kidney</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among individuals 60 years or older, four cysts in each kidney</p><p/><p>These criteria were derived from an ultrasonographic study of 128 individuals at risk for PKD1 that compared imaging findings with genotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-and-screening-for-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The specificity of these criteria was found to be 100 percent for all patients at risk for type 1 ADPKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-and-screening-for-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/11,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,14</a>]. By comparison, the sensitivity of these findings varies by patient age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-and-screening-for-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/11,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,14</a>]. Among patients between 15 and 30 years of age at risk for type 1 disease, the sensitivity of these criteria is 95 percent. The sensitivity increases to 97 to 100 percent for those older than 30 years of age. Thus, a negative ultrasound can definitely exclude type 1 disease when the patient is older than 30 years, although the false-negative rate at age 20 years is only approximately 4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-and-screening-for-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H129629736\"><span class=\"h4\">At risk for type 2 ADPKD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some asymptomatic patients at risk for ADPKD are from families with known and well-characterized pathogenic mutations in the <em>PKD2</em> locus.

Contrast-enhanced CT scanning or MRI with 3 mm slice thickness or heavy-weighted unenhanced T2 MR images can reliably detect small cysts of 2 to 3 mm diameter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-and-screening-for-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>The Toronto Radiologic Imaging Study of Polycystic Kidney Disease (TRISP) compared the diagnostic performance of high-resolution ultrasound with MRI in 110 at-risk individuals ages 16 to 40 years and 45 unaffected individuals (ie, without any family history of renal disease) of similar age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-and-screening-for-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Of the entire cohort, 73 individuals (47 percent) were genetically affected. Results were as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Only 1 of 82 unaffected individuals had &gt;3 cysts by MRI.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seventy-two of 73 affected individuals had &gt;20 cysts in both kidneys.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete separation of affected and unaffected individuals was not possible by high-resolution ultrasound, because of suboptimal ultrasound study due to increased body habitus.</p><p/><p>Thus, among at-risk individuals ages 16 to 40 years, the detection of &gt;10 cysts by MRI is sufficient for diagnosis, although most affected individuals will have &gt;20 cysts. The authors of this study recommended to use &lt;5 renal cysts for disease exclusion. This study does not provide information on patients older than 40 years.</p><p>We believe that a negative test (no cysts in either the kidneys or the liver) found with these techniques by 18 years of age virtually excludes the presence of ADPKD, at least for type 1 disease. Nevertheless, until more information becomes available, genetic testing should still be considered in patients younger than 30 years with one to four renal cysts.</p><p>Conversely, among patients with equivocal ultrasonographic studies, these techniques may demonstrate numerous small cysts, thereby possibly precluding the need for genetic testing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Approach after equivocal ultrasound results</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Occasionally, ultrasound yields equivocal results, either due to technical factors or because of patient age (ie, &lt;30 years). No formal studies have compared CT or MRI techniques or genetic testing among at-risk adult patients with equivocal ultrasonographic results. In the setting of an equivocal ultrasound, most clinicians prefer either a contrast-enhanced CT or an MRI with heavy-weighted unenhanced T2 images while others would use genetic testing.

As previously mentioned, we recommend <strong>NOT</strong> screening in children. However, if desired, we use renal ultrasonography for initial evaluation because it is safe and inexpensive.</p><p>The finding of large echogenic kidneys without distinct macroscopic cysts in infants is highly suggestive of the disease. The presence of one cyst is adequate for the diagnosis in an at-risk child (0 to 15 years of age) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-and-screening-for-autosomal-dominant-polycystic-kidney-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Genetic testing can be used when the imaging results are equivocal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> when a definite diagnosis is required (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autosomal-recessive-polycystic-kidney-disease-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H26467728\" class=\"local\">'Genetic testing'</a> below).

The specific number of cysts per kidney detected by ultrasonography that will definitively establish the diagnosis of ADPKD depends upon patient age and is the same as the criteria used in patients with asymptomatic disease.
