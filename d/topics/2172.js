There are substantial genetic differences between strains of <em>B. miyamotoi</em> obtained from different tick species; this finding is based upon genetic analysis of organisms from a variety of areas, including Japan and North America [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borrelia-miyamotoi-infection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, there are few (if any) differences between <em>B. miyamotoi</em> isolates from the same geographic area or with the same tick association [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borrelia-miyamotoi-infection/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. </p><p>Although different isolates of <em>B. miyamotoi</em> from the same tick species or same geographic area appear to constitute a single strain, each isolate has the genetic capacity for antigenic variation during infection, as occurs during relapsing fever (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=microbiology-pathogenesis-and-epidemiology-of-relapsing-fever\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Microbiology, pathogenesis, and epidemiology of relapsing fever&quot;</a>). Antigenic variation may account for the recurrences of fever that have been reported in some cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borrelia-miyamotoi-infection/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>], and could potentially limit immunity against reinfection. (See <a href=\"#H79732126\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> below.)</p><p>The best way to isolate <em>B. miyamotoi</em> from an infected person is through inoculation of blood into immunodeficient mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borrelia-miyamotoi-infection/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Although the original isolate of <em>B. miyamotoi</em> was cultured in media similar to that used for other species of <em>Borrelia</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borrelia-miyamotoi-infection/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>], success of in vitro cultivation of <em>B. miyamotoi</em> has been irregular and has varied across laboratories. There are reports of improved medium formulations to help isolate the organism; however, the yields of <em>B. miyamotoi</em> remain low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borrelia-miyamotoi-infection/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. A discussion on how to diagnose <em>B. miyamotoi</em> infection is found below.

The natural reservoirs for <em>B. miyamotoi</em> include the white-footed mouse (<em>Peromyscus leucopus</em>) in eastern North America [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borrelia-miyamotoi-infection/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], and other small rodents in Japan and Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borrelia-miyamotoi-infection/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Birds may also serve as natural hosts for <em>B. miyamotoi</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borrelia-miyamotoi-infection/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-lyme-disease#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of Lyme disease&quot;, section on 'Tick vectors'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-lyme-disease#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of Lyme disease&quot;, section on 'Reservoir hosts'</a>.)</p><p><em>B. miyamotoi</em> is transmitted to humans through ticks. The organism was first identified in <em>Ixodes persulcatus</em> ticks in Japan in 1994 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borrelia-miyamotoi-infection/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. This tick is also the vector for <em>Borrelia</em> species that cause Lyme disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borrelia-miyamotoi-infection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. <em>B. miyamotoi</em> has also been associated with other <em>Ixodes</em> species ticks that transmit Lyme disease; these include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Ixodes scapularis (</em>commonly known as the &quot;deer tick&quot; or &quot;blacklegged tick&quot;) in northeastern and north central United States and adjacent areas of Canada [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borrelia-miyamotoi-infection/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Ixodes pacificus</em> (&quot;western blacklegged tick&quot;) in far-western North America [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borrelia-miyamotoi-infection/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Ixodes ricinus</em> (the &quot;sheep tick&quot;) in Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borrelia-miyamotoi-infection/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>I. persulcatus</em> (the &quot;taiga tick&quot;) in Russia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borrelia-miyamotoi-infection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] and Asia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borrelia-miyamotoi-infection/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p>Unlike the <em>Borrelia</em> species that cause Lyme disease, <em>B. miyamotoi</em> can be vertically transmitted from an adult female through its eggs to larval offspring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borrelia-miyamotoi-infection/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Thus, infection can be acquired from the bite of a previously-unfed larval <em>Ixodes</em> tick, as well as from a nymphal or adult tick. Larval <em>Ixodes</em> ticks are particularly hard to detect on the skin because of their small size (equivalent to a poppy seed), even when engorged. In addition, in the northeastern United States, larval ticks have their peak in activity in August, one to two months after the peak of activity for nymphal ticks (the stage that most commonly transmits Lyme disease). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-lyme-disease#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of Lyme disease&quot;, section on 'Life cycle'</a>.)</p><p>In addition to transmission through ticks<em>, B. miyamotoi</em> can theoretically be transmitted through a blood transfusion. Although no transfusion-related cases of <em>B. miyamotoi</em> have been reported, there have been cases of transfusion-related transmission of <em>Borrelia </em>species that cause relapsing fever. In addition, <em>B. miyamotoi</em> has been transmitted through blood transfusion in a mouse model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borrelia-miyamotoi-infection/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H79732120\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The seasonal distribution of <em>B. miyamotoi</em> infection parallels the activity of the transmitting ticks. In the northeastern and north central United States, Europe, and Japan, tick exposure is most commonly seen in the late spring and summer months. In California and other areas with mild climates, the risk of tick exposure may extend into fall and winter months. </p><p>The prevalence of <em>B. miyamotoi </em>in four different species of <em>Ixodes </em>ticks ranges from 1 to 5 percent in areas such as North America and Eurasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borrelia-miyamotoi-infection/abstract/5,14,19,24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,14,19,24-26</a>]. In comparison, the prevalences of <em>B. burgdorferi</em> in the same type of ticks is generally 15 to 30 percent in the northeastern and north central United States. However, in California, the frequencies of <em>B. miyamotoi</em> and <em>B. burgdorferi</em> in <em>I. pacificus</em> nymphs and adults are about the same [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borrelia-miyamotoi-infection/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. </p><p>Seroprevalence and other prevalence studies of <em>B. miyamotoi</em> have found the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study evaluating tick-transmitted diseases in the northeastern United States was carried out using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing on whole blood samples from 11,515 patients with an acute febrile episode from April through November in 2013 and 2014 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borrelia-miyamotoi-infection/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The survey screened specimens for the presence of <em>B. miyamotoi</em>, <em>Anaplasma phagocytophilum</em>, and <em>Babesia microti</em>. <em>B. miyamotoi</em> and <em>A. phagocytophilum</em> were seen in approximately 1 percent of the samples, compared with 3 percent for <em>B. microti</em>. Clinical records were available for 51 of the cases that had <em>B. miyamotoi </em>infection. Of those cases, the mean age was 55, and 57 percent were male. The highest incidence of positive PCR assays for <em>B. miyamotoi</em> was in August, approximately one month after the peak incidence of early Lyme disease in this region. (See <a href=\"#H18685397\" class=\"local\">'Transmission'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serologic testing to detect antibodies against <em>B. miyamotoi</em> GlpQ protein was performed on archived samples collected between 1990 and 2010 in Lyme disease-endemic regions in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borrelia-miyamotoi-infection/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The seroprevalence of antibodies <em>against B. miyamotoi</em> was was 6 (1 percent) among 584 healthy blood donors, 9 (3 percent) among 277 patients with suspected Lyme disease, and 3 (21 percent) among 14 patients who presented with an undifferentiated febrile illness in the late spring or summer. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another serosurvey, archived sera were examined using <em>B. miyamotoi</em> GlpQ enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay&nbsp;(ELISA) and Western blot (WB) assays [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borrelia-miyamotoi-infection/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Individuals were considered to be positive for <em>B. miyamotoi</em> if both ELISA and WB were positive. The seroprevalence was 4 percent for 639 healthy individuals in Rhode Island or Massachusetts and 10 percent of 194 patients with early stage Lyme disease in Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York, or Rhode Island.

Some patients may defervesce in the absence of antibiotics. Less common findings include abdominal pain, cough, sore throat, lymphadenopathy, relapsing fever, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> neurocognitive and gait abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borrelia-miyamotoi-infection/abstract/1,7,8,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7,8,32</a>].</p><p>The clinical manifestations may depend, in part, upon the immune status of the host and whether coinfection with another pathogen is present. As an example, individuals who are immunosuppressed may be at greater risk for developing neurologic signs and symptoms secondary to central nervous system invasion of the organism compared with immunocompetent hosts. </p><p>Patients with <em>B. miyamotoi</em> infection commonly have laboratory studies that reveal leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mildly elevated transaminase levels. In patients with meningoencephalitis, the cerebrospinal fluid can reveal an elevated white blood cell count (with a lymphocyte predominance) and an elevated protein concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borrelia-miyamotoi-infection/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. </p><p>There is no evidence that <em>B. miyamotoi</em> can cause persistent infection or have chronic sequelae in immunocompetent hosts. This finding is based upon clinical observations of patients with <em>B. miyamotoi</em>, as well as the natural history of individuals who are infected with the closely related organisms that cause relapsing fever. (See <a href=\"#H18685901\" class=\"local\">'Approach'</a> below.)</p><p>The clinical manifestations of <em>B. miyamotoi</em> infection have been described in several reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borrelia-miyamotoi-infection/abstract/7,8,29,30,32-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8,29,30,32-35</a>].

The majority had marked headache, myalgia, arthralgia, malaise, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fatigue. Approximately 50 percent were suspected of having sepsis and 24 percent were hospitalized. Five patients underwent head computerized tomography and lumbar puncture, and the cerebrospinal fluid analysis was normal. One patient, who was not treated with antibiotics initially, had a recurrence of fever a month later; specimens from both episodes were positive for <em>B. miyamotoi</em>. Only 16 percent had anti-GlpQ antibodies detected at the time of presentation, whereas 86 percent were seropositive when convalescent titers were obtained.

Although this is the best point-of-care test for tick-borne and louse-borne relapsing fever during a febrile episode, there has been little reported experience with this procedure for <em>B. miyamotoi</em> infection in humans. In addition, extracellular spirochetes may be overlooked if the microscopist is in search of intracellular bacteria and parasites that are seen in white cells and erythrocytes (eg, <em>Anaplasma, Babesia </em>spp). In patients with meningoencephalitis, spirochetes in the CSF may be observed in a wet mount under darkfield or phase-contrast microscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borrelia-miyamotoi-infection/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

The complex medium is only available in few places, and the organism has not been successfully isolated in humans using this technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borrelia-miyamotoi-infection/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. An isolation method that is more likely to be successful involves inoculation of anticoagulated whole blood into immunodeficient mice, such as those with the severe combined immunodeficiency phenotype. This isolation technique is the same as that described for tick-borne-relapsing fever. A more detailed discussion of how to culture the agents of relapsing fever is found elsewhere.

There is no established western blot assay for <em>B. miyamotoi</em> infection. </p><p>There are several limitations to serologic testing. This antibody-based test is usually negative at the time a patient presents with an acute infection, and therefore, is most useful for retrospectively confirming a diagnosis. In addition, there is cross-reactivity among the GlpQ proteins of different relapsing fever species. This can lead to false-positive reactions among those exposed to <em>Borrelia</em> species that cause tick-borne relapsing fever, such as individuals in western North America.

However, hospitalization appears to be more common with <em>B. miyamotoi</em> infection than for early Lyme disease alone. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-lyme-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of Lyme disease in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human ehrlichiosis and anaplasmosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=babesiosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Babesiosis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>Although<em> B. miyamotoi</em> infection cannot be readily distinguished from other tick borne pathogens based upon clinical manifestations and epidemiologic grounds, there are certain laboratory and diagnostic findings that may suggest one diagnosis over the other:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Anaplasmosis </strong>&mdash; A relative leukopenia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> thrombocytopenia commonly occur in both anaplasmosis and <em>B. miyamotoi</em> infection; however, patients with anaplasmosis are more likely to have marked elevations in their aminotransaminase levels. In addition, evaluation of a blood smear reveals intracellular organisms in the white blood cells of a patient with anaplasmosis, whereas extracellular spirochetes are seen in those with <em>B. miyamotoi</em>. The best way to distinguish anaplasmosis from other tick borne illness is through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or serologic testing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-ehrlichiosis-and-anaplasmosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human ehrlichiosis and anaplasmosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Babesiosis </strong>&mdash; Unlike individuals with <em>B. miyamotoi</em> infection, patients with babesiosis are likely to present with evidence of hemolysis such as anemia and indirect hyperbilirubinemia. In addition, patients with Babesia may have organisms in the red blood cells. Babesia can also be identified through PCR or serologic testing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=babesiosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Babesiosis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lyme disease </strong>&mdash; Patients infected with <em>B. miyamotoi</em> may produce antibodies that cross-react with some of the antigens in whole cell-based ELISA assays used to diagnose Lyme disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/borrelia-miyamotoi-infection/abstract/8,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,30</a>]. Thus, a Lyme test that reveals a positive ELISA and a negative Western blot does not distinguish <em>B. miyamotoi</em> from early Lyme disease without a rash. Convalescent serology for <em>B. burgdorferi</em> and <em>B. miyamotoi</em> obtained four to six weeks after the patient&rsquo;s initial presentation may suggest the cause of infection; however, the use of serology is less reliable if appropriate antimicrobial therapy was administered early in the illness.

However, the frequency of recurrent fevers with <em>B. miyamotoi </em>infection is not yet known. In patients with relapsing fever, which is transmitted by soft ticks or body lice, there is usually a sudden onset of fever punctuated by an intervening afebrile period, which occurs at least twice. Thin and thick smears of blood are typically used to diagnose relapsing fever.
