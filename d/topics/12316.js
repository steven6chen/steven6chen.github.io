Among patients with cancer, there is substantial heterogeneity in how pain is experienced and in how it appears.</p><p>In many cases, the constellation of symptoms and signs can suggest a specific cancer pain syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-pain-syndromes/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The identification of such a syndrome may help to elucidate the etiology of the pain, direct the diagnostic evaluation, clarify the prognosis for the pain or the disease itself, and guide therapeutic intervention.</p><p>Cancer pain syndromes can be broadly divided into those that are acute and those that are chronic. Acute pain syndromes usually accompany diagnostic or therapeutic interventions, whereas chronic pain syndromes usually are directly related to the neoplasm itself or to an antineoplastic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-pain-syndromes/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>This topic review will provide an overview of acute and chronic cancer pain syndromes. Cancer pain assessment is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-cancer-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of cancer pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ACUTE PAIN SYNDROMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most acute cancer pain syndromes are iatrogenic, ie, related to a diagnostic test or treatment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F79852\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79852 \">table 1</a>). However, some are disease-related, such as pain due to acute hemorrhage into a tumor, bone pain from a pathologic fracture, and visceral pain from acute obstruction or perforation of a hollow structure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F71104\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71104 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Directly related to cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute pain syndromes that are directly related to the tumor may necessitate urgent treatment of the underlying lesion, in addition to aggressive pain control.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemorrhage into a tumor &ndash; The prototype for this type of pain is bleeding into a site of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This is typically accompanied by severe right upper quadrant pain, and is a potentially life-threatening complication, if the tumor ruptures. Urgent intervention for control of bleeding may be needed, in addition to transfusion and pain control. If measures such as transarterial embolization are unsuccessful, emergency surgery may be required. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-hepatocellular-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of primary hepatocellular carcinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pathologic fracture &ndash; A pathologic fracture is a bone fracture that occurs within a preexisting lesion such as a skeletal metastasis or a primary bone tumor. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-complete-and-impending-pathologic-fractures-in-patients-with-metastatic-bone-disease-multiple-myeloma-and-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of complete and impending pathologic fractures in patients with metastatic bone disease, multiple myeloma, and lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients describe the sudden onset of back or limb pain, with or without antecedent trauma. Surgical stabilization of long bone fractures, if feasible and consistent with the overall goals of care, may relieve pain and should be considered. Vertebral collapse may be treated conservatively with analgesics or with an intervention, specifically vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty; surgery is typically considered only rarely and typically to address associated neurological impairment. Radiation therapy is usually considered for all pathologic fractures and often augments pain control over a period of weeks or longer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-therapy-for-the-management-of-painful-bone-metastases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation therapy for the management of painful bone metastases&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-the-complications-of-multiple-myeloma#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of the complications of multiple myeloma&quot;, section on 'Skeletal lesions'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Obstruction/perforation</span> of a hollow viscus &ndash; Obstruction of a bile duct, ureter, or bowel lumen by an intraabdominal or pelvic cancer or retroperitoneal fibrosis can also present with acute severe pain. Relief may be obtained urgently through percutaneous decompression, stenting, or occasionally surgery.

Chemotherapy-associated mucositis can affect the mucosa throughout the entire gastrointestinal tract. However, pain most often results from oral mucositis (stomatitis), which typically becomes clinically evident during the first week after chemotherapy administration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oral-toxicity-associated-with-chemotherapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oral toxicity associated with chemotherapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The incidence varies with the drug regimen and dose, the use of concurrent therapies (especially RT), and host factors:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High doses of chemotherapy that are part of a conditioning regimen for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation cause noninfectious mucositis in approximately 70 percent of patients by killing cells with high mitotic rates. Ulceration of the oropharyngeal mucosa begins several days following initiation of the conditioning regimen. Initial symptoms may consist of mild or moderate burning discomfort, but this often progresses to the point where mucositis interferes with talking, eating, and swallowing. Significant pain requiring opioid use persists in one-half of patients at three weeks after transplant. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipient-in-the-immediate-post-transplant-period#H598154\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the hematopoietic cell transplant recipient in the immediate post-transplant period&quot;, section on 'Mucositis and nutritional support'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Standard doses of many common chemotherapeutic agents can also cause mucositis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F68013\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68013 \">table 4</a>). Newer targeted therapies, such as mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=everolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">everolimus</a>) and small molecule inhibitors of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorafenib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorafenib</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=regorafenib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">regorafenib</a>), can also cause painful stomatitis. The frequency and severity are both drug- and dose-dependent. The three most commonly used cytotoxic agents associated with oral mucositis are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a> (FU), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a>.

RT-induced mucositis is similar qualitatively to that induced by chemotherapy. It usually develops two to three weeks after starting treatment. The Incidence and severity of RT-induced mucositis depend on the field, total dose and duration of RT, and the use of concomitant chemotherapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although newer radiotherapy approaches such as 3-D conformal RT (3D-CRT) and intensity-modulated RT (IMRT) may reduce the incidence, mucositis remains a common problem in patients treated for head and neck cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-late-complications-of-head-and-neck-cancer-and-its-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of late complications of head and neck cancer and its treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-prevention-of-complications-during-initial-treatment-of-head-and-neck-cancer#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and prevention of complications during initial treatment of head and neck cancer&quot;, section on 'Mucositis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain due to mucositis may be more severe or prolonged when the ulcers become superinfected with bacteria or fungus, and in the setting of graft-versus-host disease.

Acute neuropathic pain in patients treated with chemotherapy may manifest as a polyneuropathy, or less commonly, a mononeuropathy.</p><p>Chemotherapy-related polyneuropathy was first described in patients treated with the vinca alkaloid <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a>. Other agents with a high incidence of polyneuropathy include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paclitaxel</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxaliplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxaliplatin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thalidomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thalidomide</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bortezomib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bortezomib</a>. All of these drugs can produce acute paresthesias and dysesthesias. Although they can present acutely (eg, oxaliplatin-induced pharyngolaryngeal spasm), the onset of pain associated with neuropathy in patients treated with these agents is more often insidious. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-neurologic-complications-of-non-platinum-cancer-chemotherapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of neurologic complications of non-platinum cancer chemotherapy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-neurologic-complications-of-platinum-based-chemotherapy#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of neurologic complications of platinum-based chemotherapy&quot;, section on 'Acute neurotoxicity'</a>.)</p><p>Chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain usually gradually improves after the treatment is stopped or the dose is reduced; occasionally, neuropathic pain becomes chronic. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Chemotherapy-related neuropathy'</a> below.)</p><p>Rare overall, acute chemotherapy-related mononeuropathy is best described with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vincristine-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vincristine</a>. Orofacial pain (particularly jaw pain) is the most common manifestation, with multiple sites affected in the distribution of the trigeminal and glossopharyngeal nerves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-pain-syndromes/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Other nerves, including the recurrent laryngeal, optic, and auditory nerves, may also be affected.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Other chemotherapy-related acute pain syndromes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Specific chemotherapeutic agents and hormone agents are associated with a variety of other acute pain syndromes, examples of which are provided in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F53180\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53180 \">table 5</a>). Patient education and reassurance may be the only intervention necessary in many cases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Radiation plexopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An acute, transient brachial plexopathy can occur after RT that involves a nerve plexus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F61879\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61879 \">table 3</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-pain-syndromes/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Mimicking the syndrome known as acute brachial plexitis (brachial neuritis), this disorder is characterized by pain, paresthesias, and weakness in the shoulder, arm, and hand. The syndrome is usually self-limited but may cause persistent pain or dysfunction. Newer methods of RT appear to have substantially reduced the incidence of this condition. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=brachial-plexus-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Brachial plexus syndromes&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lumbosacral-plexus-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lumbosacral plexus syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Radiation enteritis and proctitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients undergoing abdominal irradiation may experience cramping, nausea, and vomiting (radiation enteritis). The corresponding syndrome in those receiving pelvic irradiation (radiation proctitis) includes painful tenesmus with diarrhea, mucus discharge, and bleeding. Newer RT methods such as 3D-CRT have reduced the incidence and severity of these painful syndromes, but they have not eliminated the risk of bowel toxicity when the RT field includes the intestinal viscera. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-gastrointestinal-toxicity-of-radiation-therapy#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of gastrointestinal toxicity of radiation therapy&quot;, section on 'Enteritis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-radiation-proctitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of radiation proctitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Symptoms can occur within hours after the onset of RT, but they more often develop several weeks into therapy. Specific factors that increase the risk for RT-related bowel toxicity include older age, concomitant chemotherapy, and at least in the setting of rectal cancer, the use of postoperative rather than preoperative RT. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neoadjuvant-chemoradiotherapy-and-radiotherapy-for-rectal-adenocarcinoma#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and radiotherapy for rectal adenocarcinoma&quot;, section on 'Versus adjuvant chemoradiotherapy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">CHRONIC PAIN SYNDROMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately three-fourths of cancer patients who have chronic pain have nociceptive (somatic and visceral) or neuropathic syndromes that represent direct effects of the neoplasm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F57573\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57573 \">table 6</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-pain-syndromes/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-cancer-pain#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of cancer pain&quot;, section on 'Inferred pathophysiology (types of cancer pain)'</a>.)</p><p>Other causes of chronic pain in cancer patients are antineoplastic treatments (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F111093\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111093 \">table 7</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-pain-syndromes/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], and disorders that are unrelated to the disease or its treatment.</p><p>A significant barrier to better understanding chronic cancer pain syndromes, their prevalence, and their consequences, is the lack of consistent diagnostic criteria for specific syndromes. At present, they are classified according to the putative mechanism (ie, tumor related, treatment related) and the underlying pathophysiology (ie, nociceptive [somatic, visceral] or neuropathic). Efforts are underway by a collaboration between the Analgesic, Anesthetic, and Addiction Clinical Trial Translations Innovations, Opportunities, and Networks (ACTTION), a public-private partnership with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the American Pain Society (APS) to develop the ACTTION-APS Pain Taxonomy, which would allow more precise diagnosis with therapeutic recommendations. To date, this group has published consensus-based core diagnostic criteria for cancer-induced bone pain, chemotherapy-induced peripheral neuropathy, and pancreatic cancer-related pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-pain-syndromes/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Tumor-related somatic pain syndromes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tumor involvement of bone, joints, muscle, or connective tissue can cause persistent somatic pain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F57573\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57573 \">table 6</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Multifocal bone pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bone metastases are the most prevalent cause of chronic pain in cancer patients. Skeletal metastases are a common manifestation of distant disease spread from many types of solid cancers, especially those arising in the lung, breast, and prostate. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-adult-patients-with-bone-metastasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical presentation, and diagnosis of adult patients with bone metastasis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The pain associated with bone metastases may be due to direct invasion, secondary pathologic fracture, or damage to adjacent structures. Although the factors that convert a painless to a painful bone metastasis are not known, some combination of direct nociceptor activation by tumor, mechanical distortion related to microfracture, or local release of growth factors <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chemical mediators, may be involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-pain-syndromes/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Diagnostic criteria for cancer-induced bone pain are available from the ACTTION-APS collaboration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F114495\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114495 \">table 8</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-pain-syndromes/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Local field external beam RT is a well-recognized and effective palliative modality for painful bone metastases; pain relief is seen in 80 to 90 percent of cases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-therapy-for-the-management-of-painful-bone-metastases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation therapy for the management of painful bone metastases&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although the majority of patients with multifocal bone pain have widespread bony metastases, hematologic malignancies can rarely produce painful bone marrow expansion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-pain-syndromes/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. This is presumably caused by nests of rapidly growing cells in the marrow.</p><p>In addition, a rare paraneoplastic form of renal phosphate wasting called oncogenic osteomalacia can cause osteomalacia, multifocal bone pain, and fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-pain-syndromes/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This rare syndrome is most often associated with mesenchymal neoplasms, and complete tumor removal can lead to rapid correction of the biochemical derangements, remineralization of bone, and symptom improvement. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-hypophosphatemic-rickets-and-tumor-induced-osteomalacia#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary hypophosphatemic rickets and tumor-induced osteomalacia&quot;, section on 'Tumor-induced osteomalacia'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vertebral pain&nbsp;syndromes &ndash; The most common sites of bone metastases are the vertebrae. Specific syndromes may evolve from lesions involving different spinal levels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F62926\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62926 \">table 9</a>). Back pain that develops at any level from vertebral metastases may signal epidural extension, which is associated with the serious complications of spinal cord or cauda equina compression. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of neoplastic epidural spinal cord compression, including cauda equina syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Neoplastic epidural spinal cord compression (ESCC) is a common complication of cancer that can cause pain and potentially irreversible loss of neurologic function. Most often, ESCC is caused by posterior extension of a vertebral body metastasis into the epidural space (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F81204\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81204 \">figure 1</a>). ESCC almost always presents initially as back or neck pain. Because pain usually precedes neurological impairment by weeks or months, it is crucial to diagnose epidural disease extension in patients when pain is the sole complaint so that effective treatment may be started to prevent or retard the progression of neurologic impairment. For most patients, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the preferred approach to evaluate the epidural space. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neoplastic-epidural-spinal-cord-compression-including-cauda-equina-syndrome#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of neoplastic epidural spinal cord compression, including cauda equina syndrome&quot;, section on 'Radiologic confirmation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For most patients, RT represents first-line definitive treatment for ESCC. Glucocorticoid treatment is useful to temporarily improve pain and neurological functioning, often providing a window of time during which RT can be provided. Surgical decompression is considered if the tumor type is typically radioresistant and the lesion is high grade, if the neurologic status is deteriorating during RT, if ESCC occurs in a previously irradiated field, if the lesion is posterior and can be easily extirpated, or if a tissue diagnosis is needed.

In addition to local pain, tumor invasion of the hip joint may present as hip or inguinal pain upon walking or as pain in the knee or thigh. Injury to structures just inside the pelvic ring can result in related syndromes, such as a malignant piriformis syndrome (pain in the buttock <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sciatic distribution, often with exacerbation during internal rotation of the hip) or a painful plexopathy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F57573\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57573 \">table 6</a>).

Stretching of the hepatic capsule by a primary hepatoma or intrahepatic metastases can cause chronic cancer pain, which is commonly described as dull, right sided subcostal pain. If the superior aspect of the capsule is involved, diaphragmatic irritation may lead to referred pain to the top of the ipsilateral shoulder.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Pain also may result from injury or invasion of the porta hepatis, with or without biliary duct obstruction. This pain may be referred to the ipsilateral scapular region.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Midline retroperitoneal syndrome &ndash; Tumor invasion of the pancreas or other subdiaphragmatic midline structures (eg, with retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy) may produce pain by injuring the deep somatic tissues of the posterior abdominal wall or by invasion of the celiac plexus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-pain-syndromes/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>].

The syndrome can occur in a pattern of episodes lasting weeks to months, alternating with longer periods of remission.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Injury to the ninth cranial nerve is most often caused by leptomeningeal metastases, or from primary tumors or metastatic deposits that involve the jugular foramen.

This pain may be labeled a painful trigeminal neuropathy. However, because it most often presents with &ldquo;electric shock-like&rdquo; or stabbing paroxysms that are similar to the symptoms seen in the idiopathic syndrome, it may be called a malignant, or tumor-related, trigeminal neuralgia. If a lesion that involves the trigeminal nerve produces different qualities of pain, such as a constant aching or burning in the face, it is more appropriate to describe the syndrome as a painful trigeminal neuropathy rather than a malignant trigeminal neuralgia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trigeminal-neuralgia#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trigeminal neuralgia&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Many patients with tumor-related trigeminal neuralgia are treated, at least initially, for an idiopathic process. Over time, however, tumor growth leads to symptoms and signs that raise suspicion as to the nature of the disorder (eg, change in the quality of the pain or the development of neurological deficits on examination) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-pain-syndromes/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

If multiple nerve roots are affected, it is called a polyradiculopathy. A painful radiculopathy may result from leptomeningeal metastases, intradural tumor (particularly meningioma, neurofibroma, and ependymoma) or tumor in the epidural space. The latter situation is most common and may arise via posterior extension of a tumor from a vertebral body metastasis, or growth into the intervertebral foramen from a paraspinal site of disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F81204\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81204 \">figure 1</a>).

The pain, which is often described as aching or burning, may be experienced in the periauricular, postauricular, or anterior regions of the neck, or be referred to the lateral aspect of the face, head or shoulder.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If there is involvement of the superior cervical (stellate) ganglion of the sympathetic chain or of the sympathetic nerves adjacent to the carotid artery, a Horner's syndrome (ipsilateral miosis, ptosis, and anhidrosis) may be present.

Primary brachial plexus tumors, such as schwannomas or neurofibromas, are uncommon, and most occur as solitary tumors. These rarely cause symptomatic plexopathies. However, multiple tumors occur in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1, and these are more likely than solitary tumors to present with pain or clinical deficits.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Initial signs and symptoms vary based upon anatomic location (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=brachial-plexus-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Brachial plexus syndromes&quot;</a>):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>When the inferior plexus is involved first, as occurs with tumors of the lung arising in the region of the superior sulcus (Pancoast tumors), pain typically begins in the elbow and gradually spreads to involve the medial arm and hand.

Weakness and sensory loss follow. Ultimately, a panplexopathy may develop, with pain and dysfunction that affects the entire limb.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Among patients who have been previously treated for a malignancy, the differential diagnosis of a new brachial plexopathy includes recurrent tumor and radiation injury. In the setting of a known neoplasm and radiation therapy, distinguishing between cancer recurrence and radiation-induced plexopathy can be challenging. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=brachial-plexus-syndromes#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Brachial plexus syndromes&quot;, section on 'Radiation-induced'</a> and <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'Postradiation pain syndromes'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The diagnosis of neoplastic versus radiation-induced brachial plexopathy is suggested by the symptoms and signs, and electrodiagnostic findings, and is confirmed by imaging, or in some cases, by biopsy. In general, radiation-induced plexopathy is less painful than neoplastic brachial plexopathy; the upper plexus is more commonly involved, there often is relatively intense paresthesias, and radiation changes in the skin and other soft tissues are evident (eg, poikiloderma, telangiectasias, atrophy, hyperpigmentation, and lymphedema). Radiation is less likely to be associated with a Horner's syndrome than plexopathy related to tumor recurrence.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The diagnosis of a radiation-induced rather than neoplastic plexopathy is supported by the presence of so-called myokymic discharges on electromyography. These are relatively specific for radiation-induced injury, but are not a universal feature, and their absence does not exclude the diagnosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">MRI or CT scan of the plexus can usually establish the diagnosis. Occasionally, biopsy is needed. Because tumors adjacent to the spine may be responsible for a brachial plexopathy, MRI of the epidural space may be needed. Imaging of the chest by CT or MRI is most useful to detect a pulmonary tumor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Celiac plexus &ndash; Pancreatic cancer is commonly associated with intense and often refractory midepigastric pain, which is often described as gnawing, and radiates bilaterally under the ribs and into the midback.

Paraneoplastic disorders are not caused by direct tumor invasion, metabolic and nutritional deficits, infections, coagulopathy or side effects of cancer treatment.</p><p>Paraneoplastic syndromes most commonly affect the nervous system, but can affect many tissues.

Like many other neurologic paraneoplastic syndromes, it is most common in patients with small cell lung cancer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The sensory deficits typically begin with loss of vibratory sensation and joint position sense following by impairment in pain and temperature sensation. Patients frequently complain of the sensation of &ldquo;pins and needles&rdquo; or &ldquo;electric shocks.&rdquo; The symptoms may initially affect one extremity but, in a few weeks or months, they usually progress to involve other extremities, the face, abdomen, or trunk. A severe sensory ataxia may prevent walking or even self-care. In a subset of patients, hyperalgesia and spontaneous pain remain the prominent symptom, and sensory ataxia is mild or even absent.

The pain associated with these types of neuropathy begins in the feet symmetrically and gradually ascends as the lesion progresses. All of these paraneoplastic neuropathies can be the initial manifestation of an underlying malignancy and their occurrence should prompt a search for an occult cancer.

The severity of the pain, and the presence and degree of neurologic impairment vary widely depending on the agent to which the patient was exposed and the dose.

The best characterized include postmastectomy pain syndrome, post-radical neck dissection pain syndrome, post-thoracotomy pain syndrome, postoperative frozen shoulder, post-surgery pelvic floor pain, stump and phantom limb pain following amputation, and phantom breast pain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F70349\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70349 \">table 15</a>). These syndromes are predominantly neuropathic and presumably related to nerve injury at the time of surgery.

Stump pain may be due to neuroma formation several months after amputation, but a poorly fitting prosthesis, recurrent tumor, infection, or ischemia also may contribute [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-pain-syndromes/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>Phantom sensation, the sensory experience that the amputated limb is still present, occurs in most amputees. Phantom pain, which is often paroxysmal and atypical, and described by some as an intense twisting or crushing sensation, is also common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-pain-syndromes/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>Numerous neurophysiologic explanations for phantom pain have been advanced, from changes at the stump to functional cortical changes. Sensory deafferentation in primates and arm amputation in humans causes cortical somatosensory reorganization; this phenomenon may explain the elicitation of phantom pain by sensory stimulation at other sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-pain-syndromes/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>Although a number of therapeutic approaches may help [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-pain-syndromes/abstract/39-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-45</a>], management of phantom pain remains difficult.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h2\">Postradiation pain syndromes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic pain following RT is a late complication, and often must be differentiated from recurrent tumor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h3\">Plexopathies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radiation-induced cervical, brachial or lumbosacral plexopathies may occur months to many years after RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-pain-syndromes/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. The usual presenting signs are weakness and sensory changes. Although they cause pain, it is rarely severe. Chronic perineal pain following pelvic RT is often clinically associated with a sacral plexopathy. The pain is burning in nature and may extend anteriorly to the vagina or scrotum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-pain-syndromes/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>The incidence of these syndromes has declined over the years due to lower-dose regimens and better RT techniques. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=brachial-plexus-syndromes#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Brachial plexus syndromes&quot;, section on 'Neoplastic and radiation-induced brachial plexopathy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lumbosacral-plexus-syndromes#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lumbosacral plexus syndromes&quot;, section on 'Radiation plexopathy'</a>.)</p><p>The main differential is with a plexopathy from recurrent tumor. As noted above, in the setting of a known neoplasm and RT, distinguishing between cancer recurrence and radiation-induced brachial plexopathy can be challenging. These issues are discussed above (see <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Plexopathies'</a> above).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31\"><span class=\"h3\">Myelopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic radiation myelopathy is another late complication which may develop many years following the completion of RT. Sensory symptoms, including pain, typically precede the development of progressive motor and autonomic dysfunction. The pain is usually characterized as a burning dysesthesia and is localized to the area of spinal cord damage or below this region. The neurological findings may be consistent with a transverse myelopathy, sometimes in a Brown-Sequard pattern. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-spinal-cord-irradiation#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of spinal cord irradiation&quot;, section on 'Late radiation-induced myelopathy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anatomy-and-localization-of-spinal-cord-disorders#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anatomy and localization of spinal cord disorders&quot;, section on 'Brown-Sequard (hemi-cord) syndrome'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32\"><span class=\"h3\">GI tract</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic enteritis and proctitis may result from irradiation to the abdomen and pelvis. Small bowel obstruction, strictures, gastroparesis and intestinal pseudo-obstruction (eg, impaired gastrointestinal motility without any anatomical obstruction), fistula formation, gastrointestinal perforation, and bleeding are all late manifestations of radiation toxicity to the gastrointestinal tract, and persistent abdominal pain often complicates these lesions.

Approximately one-third of cancer patients with lymphedema experience pain and tightness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-pain-syndromes/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. The pathophysiology underlying the pain is usually musculoskeletal but some patients develop stretch injuries to the plexus or nerve entrapment syndromes, and as a result, experience neuropathic pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-cancer-pain-syndromes/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. The new onset of severe or progressive pain in a lymphedematous limb suggests tumor recurrence infection, or a secondary malignancy (eg, Stewart-Treves syndrome) and requires reevaluation.
