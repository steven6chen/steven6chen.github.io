HIT results from an autoantibody directed against platelet factor 4 (PF4) in complex with heparin (referred to as a HIT antibody). HIT antibodies activate platelets and can cause catastrophic arterial and venous thrombosis, with a mortality rate as high as 20 percent, although with improved recognition and early intervention, mortality rates below 2 percent have been reported.</p><p>Here we discuss the prevention and management of HIT. The clinical presentation and diagnosis of HIT are discussed separately.

In most cases, treatment must be initiated based on a strong clinical suspicion of HIT, even before confirmatory laboratory test results are available. For individuals with a strong clinical suspicion of HIT, therapy (discontinuation of all heparin, reversal of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>, initiation of a non-heparin anticoagulant) should not be delayed while awaiting laboratory testing.</p><p>There are two major goals of the initial treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>To halt platelet activation as rapidly as possible</strong>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In the vast majority of cases, platelet activation only occurs in the presence of both heparin and HIT antibodies, and elimination of all heparin exposure is the best way to halt platelet activation.

Additional interventions to halt platelet activation may be needed in these cases. (See <a href=\"#H398177496\" class=\"local\">'Autoimmune HIT'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3170421454\" class=\"local\">'Refractory (persistent) HIT'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>To provide therapeutic-dose anticoagulation with a non-heparin-anticoagulant until the thrombosis risk has returned to baseline</strong>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The risk of thrombosis is high enough that therapeutic-dose anticoagulation is needed regardless of whether a thrombotic event has occurred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. A potential exception is an individual who has clinically significant bleeding or for whom the risk of bleeding is determined to be very high. Significant thrombocytopenia alone is not a contraindication to full-dose anticoagulation. (See <a href=\"#H19930248\" class=\"local\">'Rationale for anticoagulation'</a> below and <a href=\"#H4623318\" class=\"local\">'HIT with bleeding'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>There are several options among the non-heparin anticoagulants (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F115506\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115506 \">table 1</a>). The choice of non-heparin anticoagulant must take into account the urgency for therapeutic anticoagulation (based on severity of clinical findings), the potential need for rapid reversal (ie, whether a reversal agent is available), the patient's renal and hepatic function (which affects drug metabolism), cost, and other factors. (See <a href=\"#H1159819\" class=\"local\">'Choice and dose of non-heparin anticoagulant'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The duration of anticoagulation is generally longer for people who have had a thrombotic event than for those who have not. (See <a href=\"#H330631\" class=\"local\">'Duration of anticoagulation'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Warfarin</a> can be used for anticoagulation once stable anticoagulation with another non-heparin agent has been established and an adequate platelet count has been attained (eg, <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;150,000/microL)</span>. However, warfarin should not be used before anticoagulation with a non-heparin agent has been established due to the potential risk of precipitating skin necrosis and venous limb gangrene from the transient increase in hypercoagulability resulting from rapid depletion of protein C in the first days of warfarin administration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If the patient is receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> when HIT with thrombosis develops, warfarin should be reversed with vitamin K. In the absence of thrombosis, discontinuation is sufficient. (See <a href=\"#H74408994\" class=\"local\">'Hold or reverse warfarin until anticoagulation is established'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2392980\" class=\"local\">'Transition to warfarin or other outpatient anticoagulant'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although thrombocytopenia raises concerns about bleeding, especially when administering an anticoagulant, the platelet count is expected to rise rapidly once heparin is discontinued. Thus, we generally do not consider thrombocytopenia as a contraindication to anticoagulation. These decisions require judgment of the treating clinician.</p><p/><p>All individuals with suspected HIT should have ongoing evaluation including continuous assessment for other possible causes of thrombocytopenia, serial monitoring for bleeding and thrombotic complications, and serial measurement of platelet counts and other laboratory parameters as clinically indicated. Any change in clinical findings (eg, development of a new thrombosis, further drop in platelet count) should prompt a recalculation of the 4 Ts score. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia#H28507013\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-unexplained-thrombocytopenia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with unexplained thrombocytopenia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-thrombocytopenia-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of thrombocytopenia in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Once results of HIT antibody testing are available (including a definitive result from an immunoassay <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the result of a functional assay), further planning can be made regarding the need for ongoing anticoagulation and whether or not the individual can receive heparin in the future. (See <a href=\"#H510105983\" class=\"local\">'Incorporating results of HIT antibody testing'</a> below.)</p><p>Our approach is generally similar to that of others:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 2012 guideline from the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 2013 guide from the American Society of Hematology (ASH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 2015 expert review and case discussion of HIT management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]</p><p/><p>An exception is that we include direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) among possible non-heparin anticoagulants that may be used. Data supporting their safety and efficacy were not available at the time these guidelines were prepared. The above guidelines differ somewhat on the recommended duration of anticoagulation, as discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H330631\" class=\"local\">'Duration of anticoagulation'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25998083\"><span class=\"h2\">Stop heparin for a presumptive diagnosis of HIT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individuals with a presumptive diagnosis of HIT should have immediate discontinuation of all heparin exposure. This includes <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a>, low molecular weight (LMW) heparin, heparin flushes, heparin-bonded catheters, and heparin-containing medications (eg, some prothrombin complex concentrates). The need to avoid all forms of heparin exposure should be immediately conveyed to all personnel caring for the patient, along with a notation in the patient's medical record and signs posted at the bedside or attached to all intravenous delivery devices.</p><p>However, the diagnosis of HIT must take into consideration both clinical <strong>and</strong> laboratory evidence, and, often, definitive laboratory data (ie, strongly positive immunoassay <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> positive functional assay for HIT antibodies) are not immediately available. Thus, a presumptive diagnosis of HIT must often be based on clinical findings and limited laboratory data that include serial platelet counts, other findings from the complete blood count (CBC), and coagulation testing.</p><p>Clinicians should involve the consulting hematologist as early as possible in determining the likelihood of HIT; this is especially true for clinicians who have less familiarity with HIT because errors in either direction (making a presumptive diagnosis of HIT when HIT is <strong>unlikely</strong> or failing to make a presumptive diagnosis of HIT when HIT is <strong>likely</strong>) can have serious consequences for the patient.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnosing HIT when HIT is absent exposes the patient to unnecessary bleeding risks associated with the use of anticoagulants, cancellation of needed procedures, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> future avoidance of heparin when heparin might be clinically indicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. As an example, the risk of bleeding with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=argatroban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">argatroban</a> may be as high as 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The use of a parenteral anticoagulant typically necessitates a more prolonged hospital stay. The costs of anticoagulant administration, management of complications, and extended hospitalization are substantial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Failing to diagnose HIT when HIT is likely exposes the patient to a high risk of potentially fatal thrombosis (arterial or venous). The risk of thrombosis with HIT in the absence of anticoagulation is as high as 30 to 50 percent, as discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H19930248\" class=\"local\">'Rationale for anticoagulation'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>The 4 Ts score (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-pretest-probability-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia-4-ts-score\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) is an extremely helpful and easy-to-use score that quantifies the clinical findings associated with HIT based on four parameters (degree of <strong>t</strong>hrombocytopenia, <strong>t</strong>iming, <strong>t</strong>hrombotic events or sequelae, al<strong>t</strong>ernative causes of thrombocytopenia). The 4 Ts score requires vigilance to document heparin exposure and its timing relative to a decrease in platelet count, as well as judgment related to the likelihood of alternative explanations for thrombocytopenia. It risk-stratifies patients into low, intermediate, or high probability of HIT. The score should be used as an initial guide for clinicians but should not substitute for clinical judgment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the 4 Ts score is intermediate or high probability, we make a presumptive diagnosis of HIT because an intermediate or high probability 4 Ts score will capture &gt;95 percent of patients with a reasonable likelihood of HIT regardless of whether they have had a thrombotic event. The score is highly sensitive, but many individuals with intermediate or high probability scores will not have HIT. Thus, the urgency of obtaining supportive laboratory testing should be emphasized.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the 4 Ts score is low probability, we do <strong>not </strong>make a presumptive diagnosis of HIT because the risk of HIT is exceedingly low (0 to 3 percent). However, in rare or complex cases, a clinician may suspect HIT despite a low probability 4 Ts score, and a presumptive clinical diagnosis of HIT may be made prior to laboratory testing.</p><p/><p>The clinical evaluation for suspected HIT is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia#H12052061\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia&quot;, section on 'Overview of our approach to evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>Individuals with a presumptive diagnosis of HIT should be anticoagulated until the diagnosis is confirmed (or refuted) by laboratory testing, at which time additional decisions about the duration of anticoagulation and follow-up can be made. (See <a href=\"#H510105983\" class=\"local\">'Incorporating results of HIT antibody testing'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H74408994\"><span class=\"h2\">Hold or reverse warfarin until anticoagulation is established</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Warfarin</a> is a reasonable choice for anticoagulation in HIT, but it must <strong>not</strong> be started until after the individual is stably anticoagulated for an appropriate duration with a non-heparin anticoagulant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The rationale is that during the initial phase of warfarin administration (first one to two days), there is a transient hypercoagulable state caused by rapid depletion of protein C, which has a shorter half-life than most of the anticoagulant factors. This has been observed in individuals with underlying protein C deficiency but is also possible in other individuals. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=protein-c-deficiency#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Protein C deficiency&quot;, section on 'Warfarin-induced skin necrosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-and-other-vkas-dosing-and-adverse-effects#H39\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Warfarin and other VKAs: Dosing and adverse effects&quot;, section on 'Skin necrosis'</a>.)</p><p>Even patients who develop HIT while receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> should have their warfarin held and an alternate, non-heparin anticoagulant started. These patients may transition back to warfarin after an appropriate duration of anticoagulation with the non-heparin anticoagulant. For those who also present with thrombosis, warfarin should be reversed with vitamin K.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3800006617\"><span class=\"h2\">Start full-dose therapeutic anticoagulation with a non-heparin anticoagulant</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with a presumptive clinical diagnosis of HIT <span class=\"nowrap\">(and/or</span> a confirmed diagnosis of HIT based on HIT antibody testing), we recommend immediate anticoagulation with a non-heparin anticoagulant rather than discontinuation of heparin alone, unless there is a strong contraindication (eg, bleeding, high bleeding risk). This applies to all patients, regardless of the initial indication for, and dose of, heparin (eg, full-dose anticoagulation, heparin flushes). The rationale for this practice and considerations regarding the choice of anticoagulant are discussed in the following sections.

Heparin cessation alone is not sufficient since patients with HIT remain at risk for subsequent thrombosis, especially during the period when the HIT antibody continues to activate platelets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].</p><p>The persistent risk of thrombosis is illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective series of 127 patients with HIT, in which half were only diagnosed after they had a complicating thrombotic event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

The 4 Ts score (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-pretest-probability-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia-4-ts-score\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) is an easy-to-use score that quantifies the clinical findings associated with HIT (eg, degree of <strong>t</strong>hrombocytopenia, <strong>t</strong>iming, <strong>t</strong>hrombotic events or sequelae, al<strong>t</strong>ernative causes of thrombocytopenia). This score should be used as a guide but should not substitute for clinical judgment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia#H13466287\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia&quot;, section on '4 T's score'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals with a presumptive diagnosis of HIT should be treated as if they have HIT until definitive laboratory testing is available. The two main goals of treatment are to stop platelet activation by removing all sources of heparin and to provide anticoagulation until the risk of thrombosis has returned to baseline. All sources of heparin should be discontinued. If the patient is receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>, this should be stopped (or, if thrombosis is present, reversed) until stable anticoagulation with another non-heparin anticoagulant has been established. We recommend full-dose therapeutic anticoagulation with a non-heparin anticoagulant rather than discontinuing heparin alone or discontinuing heparin and providing a lower (eg, prophylactic) dose of a non-heparin anticoagulant (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3100663304\" class=\"local\">'Immediate actions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are a number of non-heparin anticoagulants that can be used in a patient with HIT. These include parenteral direct thrombin inhibitors (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=argatroban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">argatroban</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bivalirudin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bivalirudin</a>), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=danaparoid-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">danaparoid</a> (not available in the United States), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fondaparinux-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fondaparinux</a>, or direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=apixaban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">apixaban</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=edoxaban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">edoxaban</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rivaroxaban-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rivaroxaban</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dabigatran-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dabigatran</a>. Our approach to the choice of anticoagulant takes into account the urgency of anticoagulation, possible need for urgent reversal, renal and hepatic function, and other considerations such as route of administration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F115506\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115506 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H87756545\" class=\"local\">'Anticoagulation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once definitive laboratory testing is available, we confirm or exclude the diagnosis of HIT. We consider the diagnosis confirmed if there is an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) with optical density (OD) &gt;1.00 or positive functional assay (serotonin release assay [SRA], heparin-induced platelet aggregation [HIPA]), and we consider the diagnosis excluded if there is an ELISA with OD &lt;0.40 or a negative functional assay. Individuals with a confirmed HIT diagnosis are continued on anticoagulation. Those for whom the diagnosis is excluded can resume heparin and receive heparin in the future; alternative explanations for thrombocytopenia should be sought. (See <a href=\"#H510105983\" class=\"local\">'Incorporating results of HIT antibody testing'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia#H11042890\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-heparin-induced-thrombocytopenia#H28507013\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Warfarin</a> can be started once the patient has been stably anticoagulated with a non-heparin anticoagulant and the platelet count has recovered to <span class=\"nowrap\">&ge;150,000/microL</span>. Low initial doses, rather than higher &quot;loading&quot; doses, should be used, and the non-heparin anticoagulant should be continued for at least five days along with warfarin and until the international normalized ratio (INR) has reached the target range of 2 to 3. Other options for outpatient treatment include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fondaparinux-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fondaparinux</a> or a DOAC (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F115506\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115506 \">table 1</a>). For individuals who have not had a thrombotic event, we suggest anticoagulation for at least four weeks (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For individuals who have had a thrombotic event, we suggest anticoagulation for at least three months (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The importance of lifetime avoidance of heparin should be conveyed to the patient, family members, and all clinicians caring for the patient and should be emphasized in the medical record through the inclusion of &quot;heparin allergy&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F116422\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116422 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H23143569\" class=\"local\">'Subsequent management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One exception to lifetime avoidance of heparin is a patient with a history of HIT who requires cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). Such individuals can sometimes be anticoagulated with heparin, provided that HIT antibodies are absent and the heparin exposure is limited to the operative procedure only. If HIT antibodies are present (eg, during an acute or subacute episode of HIT), management options include non-heparin anticoagulants <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> intraoperative plasma exchange. (See <a href=\"#H875123207\" class=\"local\">'Cardiopulmonary bypass'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rare forms of HIT are characterized by HIT antibodies that activate platelets in the absence of heparin (autoimmune HIT) and forms of HIT that are refractory to heparin discontinuation and anticoagulation with a non-heparin agent. These conditions should be treated similarly to other forms of HIT; in addition, they may respond to intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> (IVIG). (See <a href=\"#H398177496\" class=\"local\">'Autoimmune HIT'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3170421454\" class=\"local\">'Refractory (persistent) HIT'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding is rare with HIT, and we suggest not giving prophylactic platelet transfusions in the absence of bleeding (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). However, platelet transfusions should be given if there is clinically important bleeding and a platelet count <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;50,000/microL</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">(&lt;100,000/microL</span> for central nervous system bleeding). Anticoagulant reversal may also be indicated in selected cases of serious bleeding; this decision requires input from the treating clinician <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> consultants with expertise in HIT. (See <a href=\"#H4623318\" class=\"local\">'HIT with bleeding'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HIT is rare in pregnancy. If a pregnant woman develops HIT, or if a woman receiving anticoagulation for HIT becomes pregnant, it is important to use an anticoagulant that causes the least risk to the developing <span class=\"nowrap\">embryo/fetus</span>. Options include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fondaparinux-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fondaparinux</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=danaparoid-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">danaparoid</a>, or, for a woman with a mechanical heart valve, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>.
