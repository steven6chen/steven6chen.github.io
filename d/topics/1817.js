The vaccine was first administered to humans in 1921 and remains the only vaccine against tuberculosis in general use. Several new vaccines against tuberculosis are also in development, and many are designed to boost the effects of BCG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bcg-vaccination/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>Bacillus Calmette-Gu&eacute;rin vaccine is the most widely administered vaccine in the world; it has been given to over three billion individuals, principally in the setting of routine newborn immunization (as dictated by guidelines of the World Health Organization) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bcg-vaccination/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. There are multiple BCG vaccines in use around the world produced by different manufacturers and administered by different schedules. In the United States, BCG was sometimes administered to healthcare workers at risk for tuberculosis until the middle of the twentieth century but was never adopted for routine childhood immunization. BCG has been recommended in the United States only for immune-competent children and adults who have high risk of ongoing exposure that cannot be avoided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bcg-vaccination/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Issues related to host immunity, vaccine efficacy, administration, safety, and policy will be reviewed here. Although the major role of BCG is tuberculosis prevention, BCG vaccine is also effective for protection against leprosy, Buruli ulcer, and disease due to nontuberculous mycobacteria. In addition, it is used as an immunostimulant in the treatment of superficial carcinoma of the bladder. These topics are discussed in detail separately.

Natural infections that confer protection against tuberculosis include prior contained infection with <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> itself or prior infection with nontuberculous mycobacteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bcg-vaccination/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. These observations suggest that protection is conferred by the immune response to common mycobacterial antigens.</p><p>Prior latent infection with <em>M. tuberculosis</em> that has been contained provides as much as 80 percent protection against disease after subsequent exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bcg-vaccination/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, prior active disease is associated with an increased risk of a second episode of active tuberculosis due to a different strain in both HIV-infected and HIV-uninfected persons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bcg-vaccination/abstract/9-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberculosis-natural-history-microbiology-and-pathogenesis#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tuberculosis: Natural history, microbiology, and pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'Host factors'</a>.)</p><p>Bacille Calmette-Gu&eacute;rin (BCG) has also been associated with an overall reduction in childhood mortality not attributable to tuberculosis; this effect is not fully understood but may be related to epigenetic reprogramming of the NOD2 receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bcg-vaccination/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>].</p><p>BCG vaccine is administered either intradermally or intracutaneously. Since natural infection and sensitization to <em>M. tuberculosis</em> in humans usually occurs by the respiratory route, research is being conducted on respiratory administration of BCG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bcg-vaccination/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5714554\"><span class=\"h1\">IMMUNE RESPONSE TO BCG</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The immunologic studies of delayed infant Bacille Calmette-Gu&eacute;rin (BCG) immunization cannot yet be applied to immunization policy since a surrogate immune marker of BCG-induced protection has not been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bcg-vaccination/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Routine immunization at birth remains the preferred practice since delayed immunization may reduce BCG compliance rates and subject infants to an increased risk of interim tuberculosis exposure and all-cause mortality.</p><p>Numerous reports have evaluated the immune response to primary BCG immunization. Studies among infants demonstrate BCG-associated induction of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, interferon (IFN)-gamma<sup>+</sup>, interleukin (IL)-2<sup>+</sup>, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha<sup>+</sup>, and polyfunctional CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bcg-vaccination/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. However, none of these responses were found to correlate with protection against tuberculosis in BCG-immunized infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bcg-vaccination/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>] nor have any studies identified a surrogate marker of BCG-induced protection against tuberculosis. Among BCG-immunized infants in Uganda, lower rates of purified protein derivative (PPD)-specific T cell responses have been found among infants of mothers with latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) than infants of mothers without LTBI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bcg-vaccination/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In contrast, a study from South Africa found no difference in BCG-specific T cell proliferative responses or <span class=\"nowrap\">cytokine/chemokine</span> induction between infants of mothers with and without LTBI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bcg-vaccination/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Infant exposure to maternal HIV does not appear to have a significant effect on infant immune response to BCG administered at birth. In one study, infant immune responses to BCG did not differ between HIV-exposed and HIV-unexposed infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bcg-vaccination/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In another study, responses to <em>M. tuberculosis</em> PPD were marginally lower at 14 weeks in the HIV-exposed group but responses to BCG were similar; all measured responses were similar at 24 and 52 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bcg-vaccination/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Several studies have assessed immune responses among infants whose BCG immunization was delayed for several weeks after birth. In one study in South Africa, HIV-unexposed infants immunized at eight weeks of age had higher frequencies of BCG-specific polyfunctional T cells at one year of age compared with infants immunized at birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bcg-vaccination/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In another study among HIV-unexposed infants in the Gambia, cytokine responses were lower among infants immunized at 18 weeks of age noted lower cytokine responses than among infants immunized at birth; however, immune responses in the two groups were comparable at 36 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bcg-vaccination/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In a study among HIV-exposed infants in South Africa, immune responses were compared in infants immunized at birth versus eight weeks; at six weeks following immunization, BCG-specific T cell responses were similar, but at 14 weeks the frequency of IFN-gamma expressing CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and multifunctional BCG-specific responses were higher in the delayed immunization arm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bcg-vaccination/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Studies in adults indicate that BCG induces CD4<sup>+</sup>, IFN-gamma responses, and IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha secreting CD8<sup>+</sup> cells with cytotoxic activity; data on polyfunctional T cells has been conflicting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bcg-vaccination/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In a study among BCG-na&iuml;ve, interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA)-negative adults from the Netherlands, immune responses could be separated into two distinct patterns: a predominant proinflammatory response and a predominant T regulatory cell response with no cytokine induction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bcg-vaccination/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Vaccine site reactions were prominent in the former group but not in the latter.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFICACY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bacille Calmette-Gu&eacute;rin (BCG) is &gt;70 percent effective when given at birth to mycobacteria-na&iuml;ve infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bcg-vaccination/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The efficacy of BCG when given to adolescents and adults is variable. This discrepancy may be due to the immune status of the recipient and degree of prior exposure to mycobacteria (both <em>M. tuberculosis</em> and nontuberculous mycobacteria [NTM]).</p><p>Prior exposure may limit replication of BCG (&quot;blocking&quot;) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> confer protection equivalent to BCG (&quot;masking&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bcg-vaccination/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].

Further, studies indicate that population exposure to NTMs is high in northern as well as southern latitudes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bcg-vaccination/abstract/32,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,39</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11026751\"><span class=\"h2\">Tuberculosis</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Active disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A widely cited meta-analysis suggests that BCG vaccination reduces the risk of active TB by about 50 percent, although this figure does not reflect the important differences in efficacy in different age groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bcg-vaccination/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Primary vaccination of newborns and infants appears to confer protection in about 80 percent of cases, whereas primary vaccination of older children and adults is considerably less effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bcg-vaccination/abstract/40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-42</a>].</p><p>The greatest benefit of BCG appears to be diminished risk of tuberculous meningitis and disseminated disease in children (75 to 86 percent efficacy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bcg-vaccination/abstract/40-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-43</a>].

Collectively, these trials demonstrated an efficacy of 73 percent for protection against active disease and 87 percent against death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bcg-vaccination/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. One of these studies was a randomized trial conducted in Chicago in the 1930s in which approximately 3400 infants &le;3 months of age were randomized to receive percutaneous BCG or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bcg-vaccination/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].

Two factors may be relevant: first, natural mycobacterial infection may provide protection equal to BCG; and second, BCG may have reduced replication (and therefore reduced efficacy) in the face of prior mycobacterial immunity. The latter hypothesis is supported by an animal model in which prior infection with NTM blocks the protective effects of BCG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bcg-vaccination/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>Notable data for mycobacteria-experienced individuals may be summarized as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A trial in South India initiated in 1980 is often cited to demonstrate that BCG is not effective. This large randomized, controlled trial was designed to investigate the efficacy of BCG against tuberculosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bcg-vaccination/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>]. The study objectives of this trial were twofold: (1) to compare the efficacy of different BCG strains and doses and (2) to assess the efficacy of BCG in individuals with and without prior latent tuberculosis (determined by baseline tuberculin skin testing).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In reality, however, the trial was largely a study of the effect of BCG in older children and adults, many of whom were already tuberculin positive and all of whom lived in an area of high leprosy prevalence. Over 270,000 subjects were enrolled, but only 1500 (0.6 percent) were mycobacteria-na&iuml;ve newborns. Surveillance for tuberculosis was based on positive chest radiographs, which were only performed at age &ge;5 years; those with positive radiographs had sputum microbiology. Criteria for tuberculosis were limited to positive sputum culture or positive acid-fast bacilli (AFB) stain, and there were no methods for detecting extrapulmonary tuberculosis. These methods would be insensitive for the diagnosis of TB in children. Further, the observed rate of tuberculosis in this large study cohort was half the predicted rate. At most, this trial demonstrated that BCG vaccination of mycobacteria-experienced older children and adults in India does not lead to a reduction in pulmonary tuberculosis among persons with positive sputum cultures and chest radiographs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A trial of BCG vaccination conducted between 1935 and 1938 among Native Americans had the study with the longest period of follow-up of all BCG vaccine trials reported to date [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bcg-vaccination/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

The protective efficacy of BCG against active disease due to TB was 70 percent. Evaluation of vaccine recipients 60 years after vaccine administration (the longest follow-up period of any BCG trial) included data for 1998 of the original participants and demonstrated vaccine efficacy of 52 percent against active tuberculosis disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bcg-vaccination/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar findings were described in a trial initiated in the 1950s that involving over 25,000 British teenage students (with baseline tuberculin screening to exclude those with prior mycobacterial exposure) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bcg-vaccination/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

Estimated efficacy of neonatal BCG was similar in two diverse communities (36 versus 40 percent), while efficacy of school-age BCG differed (8 percent versus 34 percent). These findings may be due to regional differences in mycobacterial sensitization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bcg-vaccination/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13713820\"><span class=\"h4\">Mycobacteria-na&iuml;ve older children and adults</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are older children and adults in some settings who remain sufficiently mycobacteria na&iuml;ve to respond to BCG. In a subsequent analysis of the South India trial, BCG was found to be 32 percent effective in subjects who had negative NTM skin test results (purified protein derivative from <em>Mycobacterium intracellulare </em>[PPD-B]) at baseline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bcg-vaccination/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>] In a study from Brazil, where approximately 70 percent of children are tuberculin negative, BCG efficacy was 25 percent in subjects who received their first BCG vaccine at age 7 to 14 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bcg-vaccination/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Latent infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most studies have evaluated the efficacy of BCG for protection against active (rather than latent) tuberculosis. Latent infection is not generally used as an efficacy endpoint since the presence of latent infection is assessed by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberculin-skin-test-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tuberculin skin test</a> (whose utility is limited since BCG itself can sometimes induce a positive tuberculin test).

In some circumstances, BCG is also administered for healthcare workers and close contacts of patients with tuberculosis (particularly multidrug-resistant [MDR] TB) with negative tuberculin tests. In some countries, BCG is given to children soon after birth with subsequent booster inoculations, although boosters have been proven ineffective and are not recommended, even for BCG vaccine recipients who remain negative by subsequent tuberculin testing.</p><p>In countries with a low burden of TB, universal BCG vaccination is not recommended or required. For example, routine BCG vaccination has never been implemented in the United States; instead, TB control measures have focused on detection and treatment of latent tuberculosis.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Mycobacteria and host immunity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The greatest benefit of BCG appears to be diminished risk of TB, including tuberculous meningitis and disseminated disease in children. Vaccination of mycobacteria-na&iuml;ve newborns and infants appears to confer greater benefit than vaccination of older children and adults who have often had mycobacteria exposure. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Active disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Injection site reactions are common following BCG vaccination. Management of local reactions consists of attentive wound care; the efficacy of antimycobacterial therapy is uncertain, and indolent lesions are best managed with observation alone. Since viable organisms can be recovered from ulcer drainage, vaccination sites should be covered to reduce transmission of the vaccine strain. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Safety and adverse effects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serious adverse effects include osteitis, osteomyelitis, and disseminated infection. Disseminated BCG infection following BCG vaccination occurs most commonly in the setting of HIV infection and other forms of immunosuppression. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Safety and adverse effects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most individuals who have received BCG vaccine have a tuberculin reaction of 3 to 19 mm in size at two to three months following vaccination. The reaction wanes with time; at more than 10 years after vaccination, it is generally &lt;10 mm. Therefore, previous BCG vaccination should not influence decisions regarding tuberculin skin testing or interpretation of results in individuals vaccinated more than 10 years earlier. Testing with an interferon-gamma release assay may permit distinction between positive tuberculin reactions due to BCG versus tuberculosis. (See <a href=\"#H2293709761\" class=\"local\">'Interpreting TST and IGRA after BCG'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In areas where the prevalence of TB is high, we recommend that a single dose of BCG be administered to healthy neonates as soon as possible after birth (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). This includes administration of BCG vaccination to neonates born to mothers with unknown HIV status. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Children'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>BCG should NOT be administered to individuals with immune compromise due to HIV infection, congenital immunodeficiency, malignancy, or immunosuppressive drugs. For asymptomatic infants with unknown HIV status born to mothers known to be HIV infected, the optimal approach to BCG vaccination is uncertain and should be considered in conjunction with local factors. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Immunocompromised patients'</a> above and <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Children'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest NOT administering BCG in the setting of pregnancy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Groups not to vaccinate'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bcg-vaccination/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">von Reyn CF, Vuola JM.
