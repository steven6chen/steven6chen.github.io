Locally advanced, unresectable cholangiocarcinoma encompasses a heterogeneous mix of patients who fit the following categories:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Macroscopic residual disease following resection</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Locally advanced, categorically unresectable disease at presentation (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-localized-cholangiocarcinoma-adjuvant-and-neoadjuvant-therapy-and-prognosis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of localized cholangiocarcinoma: Adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Preoperative assessment and criteria for resectability'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Locally recurrent disease after potentially curative treatment</p><p/><p>The prognosis for patients with either locally unresectable or locally recurrent disease is typically measured in months, and their lives are characterized by rapid decline with symptoms of progressive biliary obstruction. The goals of palliative therapy are relief of symptoms (pain, pruritus, jaundice) and improvement in quality of life. There is no role for surgical debulking in these cases.</p><p>Nonsurgical local therapy (radiotherapy, photodynamic therapy, local ablation and embolization) can be used to prolong the time to local failure (eg, in the setting of macroscopically positive margins only) or to palliate local symptoms such as pain or jaundice (eg, in the setting of categorically unresectable or recurrent disease). Systemic chemotherapy can also enhance disease control. Although most patients will be treated with the goal of palliation, selected patients with a borderline resectable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma will have a sufficient response to neoadjuvant therapy to permit later resection.</p><p>Treatment options for locally advanced, nonmetastatic cholangiocarcinoma will be reviewed here. Epidemiology, pathology, classification, staging, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and surgical therapy for localized, potentially resectable disease, adjuvant therapy, and systemic therapy for advanced disease are discussed separately.

A margin-negative resection offers the best chance of long-term survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-options-for-locally-advanced-cholangiocarcinoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], but this is often not possible given the central location of many of these tumors.

For most patients, we suggest the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a> (FU)-based chemoradiotherapy. For patients with categorically unresectable but nonmetastatic disease and those with macroscopic residual disease after resection, we suggest radiation dose escalation to a biologic equivalent dose (BED) &gt;80.5 Gy with concurrent chemotherapy. Where available, stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) is an alternative to FU-based chemoradiotherapy. Conformal treatment planning is preferred if it is available. For most patients, we suggest systemic chemotherapy using a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gemcitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gemcitabine</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a></span> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capecitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capecitabine</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/gemcitabine</span> doublet regimen followed by chemoradiotherapy.</p><p>Nonsurgical methods of tumor ablation that may provide adequate local palliation for patients who are not candidates for chemoradiotherapy include radiofrequency ablation (RFA), hepatic intraarterial chemotherapy, embolization with and without intraarterial chemotherapy, and radioembolization using yttrium-90 [Y90]-tagged glass or resin microspheres that are delivered selectively to the tumor via the hepatic artery. For other patients, palliative chemotherapy alone is an option.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h3\">Radiotherapy and chemoradiotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approaches to radiotherapy for patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma include external beam irradiation delivered either by conventional approaches or with conformal treatment planning techniques, brachytherapy with iridium-192, and SBRT. With brachytherapy, thin wires of Ir-192 are introduced into the bile ducts via a catheter; these deliver high dose radiation to the tumors but very low doses to surrounding tissue. Stereotactic body radiotherapy is a form of external beam RT (EBRT), which couples a high degree of anatomic targeting with high doses of radiation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-therapy-techniques-in-cancer-treatment#H654912\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation therapy techniques in cancer treatment&quot;, section on 'Stereotactic radiation therapy techniques'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h4\">Microscopically positive margins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite uncertainty as to its survival benefit, postoperative adjuvant therapy (chemoradiotherapy using conventional dose RT, systemic chemotherapy, or a combination approach) is widely recommended for patients with microscopic residual disease following resection of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas by expert groups, including the <a href=\"http://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/f_guidelines.asp&amp;token=yAtQYciL7uywmW3eRYUeJ4aK0dRx4JGGLufx5fCsL/3GEnpty51PpRmw8L7qDt7YvrmdE8jMEGNSa6WMQQkRzhg6guWN9QugGEPeOqp3ljo=&amp;TOPIC_ID=2497\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)</a>.

Options include chemotherapy alone, concurrent chemoradiotherapy with or without additional systemic chemotherapy, and nonsurgical methods of local <span class=\"nowrap\">ablation/embolization</span>. There are no randomized trials directly comparing any of these approaches. However, for most patients, we prefer systemic therapy followed by fluoropyrimidine-based dose-escalated chemoradiotherapy. In at least one retrospective review, patients treated with combined chemoradiotherapy plus systemic chemotherapy had a better outcome (median progression-free survival 4.3 versus 1.9 months, overall survival 9.3 versus 6.3 months) than did those treated with systemic chemotherapy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-options-for-locally-advanced-cholangiocarcinoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Higher dose RT approaches that use either a combination of transcatheter brachytherapy plus EBRT, three-dimensional conformal RT (3D-CRT), or intensity modulated RT (IMRT) with or without chemotherapy may be associated with better local control and possibly prolonged survival in patients with intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-options-for-locally-advanced-cholangiocarcinoma/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. As an example, in a series of 79 consecutive patients with inoperable intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma treated with definitive RT between 2002 and 2014, doses ranged from 35 to 100 Gy in 3 to 30 fractions, for a median BED of 80.5 Gy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-options-for-locally-advanced-cholangiocarcinoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Seventy patients received systemic chemotherapy prior to RT, and the majority of patients (63 percent) received concurrent chemotherapy with RT. At a median follow-up of 33 months, the three-year overall survival rate was 44 percent, and it was significantly higher for those receiving a BED &gt;80.5 Gy (73 versus 38 percent); the corresponding local control rates were 78 versus 45 percent. These outcomes compare favorably with historical series that used conventional fractionation and doses of EBRT.</p><p>Technical advances over the last decade have created the ability to deliver more precise, highly conformal radiation treatment to a tumor, maximally sparing adjacent normal tissues. The enhanced capability to spare such normal tissues now permits the safe delivery of one to five fractions of high-dose radiation to a target (ie, SBRT), whereas in the past, small fractions of daily radiation over many weeks were typically used to spare normal tissues. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-therapy-techniques-in-cancer-treatment#H654912\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation therapy techniques in cancer treatment&quot;, section on 'Stereotactic radiation therapy techniques'</a>.) </p><p>Experience with SBRT for treatment of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas is limited, and most reports are single institution, retrospective series, involving limited numbers of both intrahepatic and hilar (Klatskin) cholangiocarcinomas. However, taken together, the reports demonstrate high rates of local control with modest toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-options-for-locally-advanced-cholangiocarcinoma/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>]. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One report included 27 patients with unresectable Klatskin (n = 26) or intrahepatic (n = 1) cholangiocarcinoma who underwent SBRT (45 Gy in three fractions) as the sole form of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-options-for-locally-advanced-cholangiocarcinoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. At a median follow-up of 5.4 years, two remained alive, and the median progression-free and overall survival durations were 6.7 and 10.6 months, respectively. While local control was maintained in 84 percent of patients at one year, six had severe <span class=\"nowrap\">duodenal/pyloric</span> ulceration and three developed duodenal stenosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective series of 58 patients with primary (n = 28) or recurrent (n = 30) cholangiocarcinomas (33 intrahepatic, 25 extrahepatic) treated with SBRT (45 Gy in three fractions) also demonstrated high rates of local control at one and two year time points of 85 and 72 percent, respectively. With median follow up of 10 months, six patients (10 percent) experienced grade 3+ toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-options-for-locally-advanced-cholangiocarcinoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another study of 34 patients with unresectable intrahepatic or hilar cholangiocarcinoma or margin-positive resection delivered 30 Gy in three fractions. The actuarial local control was 79 percent, with median survival of 17 months and 12 percent having grade 3 toxicity, including duodenal ulceration, cholangitis, and liver abscess [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-options-for-locally-advanced-cholangiocarcinoma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p>Some small series have combined SBRT with systemic therapy. One report included 10 patients with hilar cholangiocarcinoma treated with SBRT (30 Gy in three fractions) with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gemcitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gemcitabine</a>. Local control was 80 percent, with 80 percent two-year survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-options-for-locally-advanced-cholangiocarcinoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Proton beam irradiation represents another method of delivering high-dose, conformal radiotherapy. Most data are limited to single institution, retrospective studies. A prospective, multi-institutional phase II study evaluated the efficacy and safety of high-dose, hypofractionated proton beam therapy for unresectable hepatocellular (n = 44) and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (n = 37). A dose of 67.5 Gy equivalent was delivered over 15 fractions. The two-year local control and overall survival were 94.1 and 46.5 percent, respectively, in the cholangiocarcinoma cohort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-options-for-locally-advanced-cholangiocarcinoma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Importantly, no randomized trial has compared these newer radiotherapy techniques to conventionally fractionated fluoropyrimidine-based chemoradiotherapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2363707052\"><span class=\"h5\">Neoadjuvant approaches</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients undergoing combined treatment with chemotherapy and concurrent chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced unresectable tumors, we generally start with chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy for those without disease progression.

The median number of treatment sessions was two (range one to eight), and there were complete or partial radiographic responses (using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] criteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F58792\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58792 \">table 1</a>)) in 41 patients (26 percent) while 99 (62 percent) had stable disease. Median overall survival was 13.2 months and did not differ on the basis of the type of intraarterial therapy.

Nevertheless, successful endoscopic deployment of a stent (or multiple stents as needed to span the malignant stricture) is possible in 70 to 100 percent of patients.</p><p>Among the major issues are the optimal approach to stent placement, extent of decompression that is necessary to restore sufficient bile flow while avoiding the risk of bacterial cholangitis, the optimal approach to placement of the stents, and the use of plastic or metal (and bare versus covered) stents.

Furthermore, percutaneous stents are usually left to open drainage external to the body, at least initially, and this is often inconvenient to the patient. As a result, in most institutions, an initial endoscopic attempt at drainage is usually preferred, if possible. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-stenting-for-malignant-pancreaticobiliary-obstruction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic stenting for malignant pancreaticobiliary obstruction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Unilateral versus bilateral stents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with hilar obstruction, whether to use unilateral or bilateral stents is debated. In many cases, unilateral stent placement will be adequate because only 25 to 30 percent of the liver needs to be drained to relieve jaundice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-options-for-locally-advanced-cholangiocarcinoma/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. However, unilateral drainage alone may not relieve jaundice completely and may increase the risk of cholangitis.</p><p>Studies comparing these approaches have reached variable conclusions.</p><p>Many endoscopists place bilateral stents (plastic or metal) when possible in an attempt to maximize biliary drainage. Preprocedure computed tomography <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography imaging is often used in an attempt to identify the dominant biliary system in the event that only one side can be drained endoscopically. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-stenting-for-malignant-pancreaticobiliary-obstruction#H17011729\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic stenting for malignant pancreaticobiliary obstruction&quot;, section on 'Unilateral versus bilateral stenting'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Plastic versus metal stents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endoscopic biliary decompression can be achieved using either plastic or expandable metal stents. A variety of plastic and metal stents, both covered and uncovered, are available. A systematic review concluded that neither stent type offered a survival advantage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-options-for-locally-advanced-cholangiocarcinoma/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. As a result, the decision to use one versus another should be guided by expected length of survival, quality of life, costs, and physician expertise. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-stenting-for-malignant-pancreaticobiliary-obstruction#H1135516949\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic stenting for malignant pancreaticobiliary obstruction&quot;, section on 'Types of stents'</a>.)</p><p>The placement of a plastic stent is inexpensive and effective, and the stent can be easily removed or exchanged. Plastic stents, however, eventually develop occlusion by sludge <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bacterial biofilm, and maintaining biliary drainage with plastic stents usually requires repeated endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatographies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-stenting-for-malignant-pancreaticobiliary-obstruction#H17011418\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic stenting for malignant pancreaticobiliary obstruction&quot;, section on 'Patency of plastic stents'</a>.)</p><p>Metal stents extend the duration of stent patency (approximately 8 to 12 versus 2 to 5 months). However, metal stents have significantly higher costs and may not be removable. Thus, the diagnosis of malignant disease must be firmly established before a metal stent is deployed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-stenting-for-malignant-pancreaticobiliary-obstruction#H17011425\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic stenting for malignant pancreaticobiliary obstruction&quot;, section on 'Plastic versus metal stents'</a>.) &#160;</p><p>Plastic stents are often used to initially achieve drainage while the diagnostic work-up is ongoing or when a metal stent cannot be inserted for technical reasons. The high occlusion rate of plastic (polyethylene) stents (average 42 percent) can be reduced by changing the stents every three to six months. An alternative approach is to wait for a complication before changing the stent since many patients will die of their disease before their stents become obstructed. However, patients are at risk to develop cholangitis when the stent becomes obstructed. The preferred approach for patients who are expected to live beyond a few months is to replace the plastic stent with a metal one as soon as is feasible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H718232158\"><span class=\"h3\">Covered versus uncovered stents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several trials have evaluated differences in stent patency rates between covered and uncovered metal stents for the treatment of distal malignant biliary disease; despite showing significantly less tumor ingrowth, patency rates are not higher for covered stents. This can likely be explained by the many other etiologies of stent occlusion other than tumor ingrowth, including tumor overgrowth and stent obstruction by debris and biliary sludge. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-stenting-for-malignant-pancreaticobiliary-obstruction#H1135517058\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic stenting for malignant pancreaticobiliary obstruction&quot;, section on 'Complications'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-stenting-for-malignant-pancreaticobiliary-obstruction#H7922550\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic stenting for malignant pancreaticobiliary obstruction&quot;, section on 'Covered versus uncovered metal stents'</a>.)</p><p>For the treatment of distal malignant biliary obstruction, many endoscopists place uncovered (bare) metal stents in patients with an intact gallbladder. For patients who have undergone prior cholecystectomy, the choice of a covered versus uncovered stent is individualized given the location and geometry of the stenosis. Patients with extrinsic compression may be adequately treated with an uncovered stent, while those with intrinsic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> papillary tumors may benefit from a covered stent in an attempt to minimize tumor ingrowth. Covered metal stents are only used for distal biliary strictures because, with hilar tumors, deployment may inadvertently result in occlusion of a major hepatic duct. This subject is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-stenting-for-malignant-pancreaticobiliary-obstruction#H1135516991\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic stenting for malignant pancreaticobiliary obstruction&quot;, section on 'Covered metal stents'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Prophylactic antibiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prophylactic antibiotics have been examined as a means of reducing rates of stent occlusion among patients with indwelling stents. Two early trials and a pooled analysis of both did not demonstrate any advantage in terms of stent occlusion, and they are not recommended for all patients who have an indwelling stent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-stenting-for-malignant-pancreaticobiliary-obstruction#H17011418\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic stenting for malignant pancreaticobiliary obstruction&quot;, section on 'Patency of plastic stents'</a>.)</p><p>However, benefit in terms of lower rates of cholangitis was suggested in a randomized trial in which 94 patients with a plastic stent for palliation of malignant jaundice (mainly due to pancreatic cancer) were randomly assigned to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> (500 mg twice daily) or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-options-for-locally-advanced-cholangiocarcinoma/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. Although there was no significant difference in long-term patency (as was seen in the other trials), patients who received prophylactic ciprofloxacin had significantly fewer episodes of cholangitis (23 versus 42 percent), and better quality of life.</p><p>Based upon these data, we routinely use prophylactic antibiotics to reduce rates of cholangitis in patients receiving an endoscopically placed plastic or metal stent for long-term palliation of obstructive jaundice after the first episode of cholangitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Locally advanced, unresectable cholangiocarcinoma encompasses a heterogeneous mix of patients who fit the following categories (see <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Macroscopic residual disease following resection</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Locally advanced, categorically unresectable disease at presentation (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-localized-cholangiocarcinoma-adjuvant-and-neoadjuvant-therapy-and-prognosis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of localized cholangiocarcinoma: Adjuvant and neoadjuvant therapy and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Preoperative assessment and criteria for resectability'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Locally recurrent disease after potentially curative treatment</p><p/><p>The optimal approach to patients with locally advanced unresectable or recurrent cholangiocarcinoma remains uncertain.
