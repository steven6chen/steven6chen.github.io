While patients with advanced exocrine pancreatic insufficiency usually present with abdominal pain and steatorrhea, those with less severe insufficiency may only have mild symptoms. This topic will review the etiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency.

Normal pancreatic juice is clear, colorless, isotonic, and alkaline. The composition of pancreatic juice differs in basal and stimulated phases. In the fasting state, pancreatic fluid is protein-rich and has a bicarbonate concentration of 80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span>. Stimulation of the pancreas after a meal increases the flow of water and the bicarbonate concentration of pancreatic juice. A large volume of alkaline, enzyme-rich fluid enters the duodenum to neutralize gastric chyme for optimal digestion.</p><p>Pancreatic secretion is controlled by hormonal and neuronal mechanisms. The principal regulatory hormones are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secretin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">secretin</a> and cholecystokinin (CCK). Both are tightly regulated by negative feedback mechanisms. Secretin is released from the duodenal mucosa in response to the presence of acid in the duodenum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F53090\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53090 \">figure 1</a>). Secretin primarily stimulates the release of bicarbonate and water from the interlobular duct cells and causes a gradual rise in the flow of pancreatic fluid through the ducts and a typical pattern of electrolyte secretion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F82081\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82081 \">figure 2</a>). As bicarbonate concentration rises to a peak concentration of 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L,</span> chloride concentration decreases reciprocally to maintain isotonicity. CCK is released from gut endocrine cells in response to the entry of fat and protein into the proximal intestine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F66575\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66575 \">figure 3</a>). CCK acts directly and through vagal afferents to stimulate pancreatic acinar cells to release digestive proenzymes.

This protein regulates the transport of chloride and sodium across endothelial cell membranes in the lungs and exocrine glands. Approximately 80 percent of patients with cystic fibrosis also develop progressive pancreatic damage due to the blockage of ductules resulting from inspissated pancreatic secretion.

Total or a partial resection of the pancreas may result in varying degrees of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency due to reduction of glandular tissue or postoperative pancreatic duct occlusion. Extensive denervation following lymph node dissection can result in postcibal asynchrony and decreased pancreatic stimulation.

Patients with gastrinoma (Zollinger-Ellison syndrome) may develop exocrine pancreatic insufficiency due to inactivation of pancreatic enzymes by gastric acid. Small bowel mucosal disease (eg, celiac disease) can result in decreased cholecystokinin release, which in turn can result in reduced pancreatic secretion.

Patients with steatorrhea report loose, greasy, foul-smelling stools that are difficult to flush. Other symptoms include bloating, cramping, and increased flatulence.

Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency should also be suspected in patients with milder symptoms of bloating with overt morphological abnormalities on pancreatic imaging that are suggestive of chronic pancreatitis (eg, calcifications <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> main pancreatic duct dilation). We begin with an indirect test of pancreas function (fecal elastase-1) to establish the diagnosis of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. In patients in whom indirect tests are inconclusive, but the clinical suspicion of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency remains high, we perform direct pancreas function testing with an endoscopic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secretin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">secretin</a> test. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3062825654\"><span class=\"h2\">Indirect pancreatic function tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Indirect tests measure the consequence of exocrine insufficiency (maldigestion). Indirect tests are simpler, easier to perform, and less expensive as compared with direct pancreas function tests. Their main role is in diagnosis of advanced exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. They are much less sensitive as compared with direct tests for diagnosis of earlier stages of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. Other disadvantages include false positive results with non-pancreatic gastrointestinal diseases and the need for stool collection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3647374121\"><span class=\"h3\">Fecal elastase-1</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fecal elastase in the most sensitive and specific indirect test of pancreatic function. Fecal elastase-1 is an enzymatic product of pancreatic secretion that remains relatively stable during transport through the gastrointestinal tract. There is a direct correlation in pancreatic elastase-1 concentrations in pancreatic fluid and stool [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exocrine-pancreatic-insufficiency/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Fecal elastase-1 &lt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/g</span> is considered abnormal. Fecal elastase-1 between 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/g</span> and 250 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/g</span> may be considered borderline and retesting should be considered. </p><p>The sensitivity of fecal elastase-1 for mild, moderate, and severe exocrine pancreatic insufficiency in patients with chronic pancreatitis are 63, 100, and 100 percent, respectively. Fecal elastase has a specificity of 93 percent in patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exocrine-pancreatic-insufficiency/abstract/17,19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,19-21</a>]. Watery diarrhea from nonpancreatic diseases or medications may dilute the fecal specimen and produce false positive results owing to dilution, resulting in artificially low levels of the enzyme. This limitation can be ameliorated by lyophilizing (concentrating) the stool sample [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exocrine-pancreatic-insufficiency/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1778825493\" class=\"local\">'Fecal chymotrypsin'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1778825493\"><span class=\"h3\">Fecal chymotrypsin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fecal chymotrypsin is also an enzymatic product of pancreatic secretion that can be used to detect pancreatic insufficiency. However, chymotrypsin has a lower sensitivity and specificity for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency as compared with fecal elastase-1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exocrine-pancreatic-insufficiency/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The sensitivity of fecal chymotrypsin for mild to moderate and advanced pancreatic insufficiency is 49 and 85 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exocrine-pancreatic-insufficiency/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Chymotrypsin is variably affected during intestinal transport and may be diluted in the presence of concomitant diarrhea. Since chymotrypsin is present in commercially available enzymes, patients must stop exogenous enzymes for two days prior to testing. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H56757005\"><span class=\"h3\">Serum trypsinogen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serum trypsinogen is an inexpensive and widely available test that reflects pancreatic acinar cell mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exocrine-pancreatic-insufficiency/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Serum trypsinogen has a high sensitivity for advanced exocrine pancreatic insufficiency when trypsinogen levels are less than 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exocrine-pancreatic-insufficiency/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. However, the test has low sensitivity for diagnosing less severe exocrine pancreatic insufficiency when trypsinogen levels are between 20 and 29 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span>. In addition, serum trypsinogen is not specific for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and levels rise with acute pancreatitis and abdominal pain of nonpancreatic origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exocrine-pancreatic-insufficiency/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. &#160; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Direct pancreatic function tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Direct pancreatic function tests are the most sensitive diagnostic tests for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exocrine-pancreatic-insufficiency/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. They involve stimulation of the pancreas through the administration of hormonal secretagogues after which duodenal fluid is collected and analyzed to directly quantify pancreatic secretory content (ie, enzymes and bicarbonate). Limitations include the lack of standardization of testing protocol and normal ranges, limited availability of expertise needed to perform the test, and poor patient tolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exocrine-pancreatic-insufficiency/abstract/23,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,29</a>]. Cholecystokinin (CCK) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secretin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">secretin</a> have both been used to stimulate pancreatic secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exocrine-pancreatic-insufficiency/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. However, it is unclear which secretagogue offers the best sensitivity for early pancreatic insufficiency. Studies evaluating the performance of direct pancreas function tests in patients with established chronic pancreatitis on imaging have demonstrated a sensitivity of 72 to 94 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exocrine-pancreatic-insufficiency/abstract/28,33-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,33-42</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2397234131\"><span class=\"h3\">Secretin test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Direct pancreas function testing using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secretin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">secretin</a> stimulation measures the ability of ductal cells to produce bicarbonate. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Tradition test</strong> &ndash; The traditional direct pancreas function test is cumbersome and is poorly tolerated by patients. It requires fluoroscopic placement of an oroduodenal collection tube (eg, Dreiling tube) with gastric and duodenal ports (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F72009\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef72009 \">image 1</a>). After a test dose (0.2 mcg) of synthetic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secretin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">secretin</a>, a full dose (0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg)</span> is administered as an intravenous bolus. Duodenal fluid is continuously collected in 15-minute aliquots for one hour. Fluid is analyzed for bicarbonate concentration, volume, and total bicarbonate output. A bicarbonate concentration less than 80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> in all of the four aliquots is diagnostic of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exocrine-pancreatic-insufficiency/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Severe exocrine pancreatic insufficiency is characterized by a peak bicarbonate concentration less than 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span>. Total volume and bicarbonate output have been used as secondary diagnostic parameters when bicarbonate concentration is equivocal. However, bicarbonate output and fluid volume are notoriously inaccurate measures because of the incomplete recovery of duodenal fluid. A shortened collection period has also been evaluated but has significantly lower accuracy in diagnosing pancreatic insufficiency as compared with the standard one-hour collection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exocrine-pancreatic-insufficiency/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Endoscopic test</strong> &ndash; Endoscopically-assisted and purely endoscopic pancreatic function test are performed under sedation and are better tolerated as compared with tradition direct pancreas function test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exocrine-pancreatic-insufficiency/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. In endoscopically-assisted pancreas function tests, an endoscopically placed Dreiling or Liguory tube is used for duodenal fluid collection. In contrast, in purely endoscopic pancreas function testing, duodenal fluid is collected through the endoscope into a specimen trap.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The protocol for the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secretin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">secretin</a> endoscopic pancreatic function test is similar to the traditional secretin test protocol. Duodenal aspirates are obtained 0, 15, 30, 45, and 60 minutes after administration of secretin; however, aspiration at 30 to 45 minutes can simplify the test and appears to be sufficient for screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exocrine-pancreatic-insufficiency/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. A peak bicarbonate concentration &lt;80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> is considered abnormal for the one-hour method. A cutoff of 75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> is used for the shortened test. The secretin endoscopic pancreatic function test method replicates the well-known pancreatic secretory patterns observed with collection tubes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F66606\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66606 \">figure 4</a>) and is comparable in accuracy to the traditional secretin test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exocrine-pancreatic-insufficiency/abstract/48-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-50</a>]. In one retrospective study that included 25 patients with chronic pancreatitis, the sensitivity and specificity of endoscopic secretin pancreas function testing for chronic pancreatitis was 86 and 67 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exocrine-pancreatic-insufficiency/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Standard doses of sedation do not appear to decrease pancreas secretion, but caution in interpretation of abnormal results is needed when large amounts of analgesia are needed for endoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exocrine-pancreatic-insufficiency/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Intraductal collection of secretin-stimulated pure pancreatic juice at the time of endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography has also been evaluated as an alternative to standard <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secretin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">secretin</a> testing because it permits simultaneous evaluation of pancreatic structure and function. However, studies of intraductal secretin tests have yielded mixed results and the procedure carries the risk of acute pancreatitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exocrine-pancreatic-insufficiency/abstract/53-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">53-56</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">CCK test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Use of CCK receptor agonist (eg, cerulein) as a hormonal stimulant provides information on the enzyme secretory capacity of the pancreas. However, thresholds for lipase concentrations have not been well established and results from studies have been conflicting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exocrine-pancreatic-insufficiency/abstract/57-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">57-59</a>]. Traditionally, this test requires the placement of two tubes: a double-lumen duodenal tube and a single-lumen gastric tube [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exocrine-pancreatic-insufficiency/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The gastric tube continuously collects and discards gastric fluid to prevent acidification of the duodenum. One duodenal lumen continuously collects duodenal drainage fluid. The other lumen perfuses a mannitol-saline solution with a non-absorbable marker (polyethylene glycol [PEG]). An accurate determination is made of enzyme concentration, enzyme output, and fluid volume based upon recovery of the PEG marker. CCK pancreas function test has also been performed endoscopically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exocrine-pancreatic-insufficiency/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Secretin-CCK test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of the secretin-CCK test is limited to pancreatic research centers in Europe and Japan. The secretin-CCK test provides simultaneous assessment of ductal and acinar secretory capacity. Several dosing regimens have been evaluated for the secretin-CCK test. The two hormones have been administered as a bolus injection or continuous infusion, simultaneously, or sequentially [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exocrine-pancreatic-insufficiency/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Whether the use of combined stimulants improves sensitivity for early exocrine dysfunction or chronic pancreatitis is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exocrine-pancreatic-insufficiency/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3195254817\"><span class=\"h3\">Other</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other tests that are not routinely performed to measure pancreatic function include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Breath</strong> <strong>tests</strong> &ndash; Breath tests for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency involve the oral administration of 13C-marked substrates with a test meal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/exocrine-pancreatic-insufficiency/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>]. These substrates are hydrolyzed within the intestinal lumen in proportion to the amount of pancreatic lipase activity. The hydrolyzed products are absorbed and metabolized, and eventually released across the pulmonary endothelium as 13CO2. Mass spectrometry or infrared analysis is used to quantify 13CO2. Like other indirect tests, breath tests quantify fat malabsorption and are therefore nonspecific and inaccurate for the diagnosis of mild exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. In the United States, breath tests have not been approved for diagnosis of exocrine insufficiency.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=secretin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Secretin</a>-<strong>enhanced</strong> <strong>diffusion weighted</strong> <strong>magnetic resonance imaging </strong>&ndash; Secretin-enhanced magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography also allows timed assessments of duodenal filling, which provides an estimation of pancreatic exocrine function. Secretin stimulates both pancreatic ductal secretion of water and pancreatic blood flow. Diffusion weight magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) permits detection of the mobility of water molecules and increased capillary blood flow in pancreatic parenchyma. The apparent diffusion coefficient is a calculated measure that integrates both diffusion and perfusion.

In patients in whom the history can often clearly point to the underlying etiology, we do not perform additional evaluation in the absence of worrisome clinical features (eg, new onset of steatorrhea with weight loss). Historical clues that may be indicative of a specific etiology include a history of cystic fibrosis, chronic pancreatitis, and <span class=\"nowrap\">gastric/small</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">bowel/pancreatic</span> resection. In patients with new onset steatorrhea and weight loss, we perform an abdominal computerized tomography scan or endoscopic ultrasound to rule out pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.

Patients with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency are also at risk for deficiencies of fat-soluble vitamins and other micronutrients, and bone disease. Prevention and monitoring for these complications are discussed separately.

(See <a href=\"#H2482574495\" class=\"local\">'Etiology and pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pancreas secretes approximately 1.5 liters of enzyme-rich fluid every day for the digestion of fats, starch, and protein. Stimulation of the pancreas after a meal increases the flow of water and the bicarbonate concentration of pancreatic juice. A large volume of alkaline, enzyme-rich fluid enters the duodenum to neutralize gastric chyme for optimal digestion. The principal pancreatic regulatory hormones are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secretin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">secretin</a> and cholecystokinin. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Normal pancreatic physiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with mild exocrine pancreatic insufficiency may be asymptomatic or have mild abdominal discomfort and bloating with normal-appearing bowel movements. Overt steatorrhea does not occur until approximately 90 percent of glandular function has been lost. Advanced exocrine pancreatic insufficiency results in maldigestion of fat and protein and weight loss. Patients with steatorrhea report loose, greasy, foul-smelling stools that are difficult to flush. Other symptoms include bloating, cramping, and increased flatulence. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with severe exocrine pancreatic insufficiency have elevated levels of fecal fat. Malabsorption of the fat soluble vitamins (A, D, E, K) and vitamin B12 may also occur, although clinically symptomatic vitamin deficiency is rare. (See <a href=\"#H1648244338\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with chronic pancreatitis, calcifications, ductal dilatation, enlargement of the pancreas, and peripancreatic fluid collections may be detected on abdominal imaging. Patients with advanced chronic pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis, Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, and advanced hemochromatosis may have pancreatic atrophy on imaging. (See <a href=\"#H3367394501\" class=\"local\">'Imaging findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency should be suspected in patients with chronic <span class=\"nowrap\">diarrhea/steatorrhea</span> and chronic abdominal pain. Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency should also be suspected in patients with milder symptoms of bloating with morphological abnormalities on pancreatic imaging that are suggestive of chronic pancreatitis (eg, calcifications <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> main pancreatic duct dilation). We begin with an indirect test of pancreas function (fecal elastase-1) to establish the diagnosis of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency. In patients in whom indirect tests are inconclusive but the clinical suspicion of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency remains high, we perform direct pancreas function testing with an endoscopic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secretin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">secretin</a> test.
