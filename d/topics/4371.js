(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=grief-and-bereavement-in-adults-clinical-features#H11410500\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Grief and bereavement in adults: Clinical features&quot;, section on 'Bereavement'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Grief</strong> &ndash; Grief is the natural response (including thoughts, feelings, behaviors, and physiologic reactions) to bereavement. Although grief can occur in response to other meaningful (non-bereavement) losses, this topic focuses primarily upon grief in response to the death of a loved one.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The pattern and intensity of grief varies over time as bereaved individuals adapt to the loss. The experience of grief is influenced by cultural and religious rituals that vary widely, and is unique to each person and each loss. Progress from acute to integrated grief is often erratic and hard to discern as it is happening. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=grief-and-bereavement-in-adults-clinical-features#H8568685\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Grief and bereavement in adults: Clinical features&quot;, section on 'Typical acute grief'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Complicated grief </strong>&ndash; Complicated grief is a form of acute grief that is unusually prolonged, intense, and disabling; troubling thoughts, dysfunctional behaviors, dysregulated emotions, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> serious psychosocial problems impede adaptation to the loss. The syndrome of complicated grief is a unique and recognizable condition that can be differentiated from other mental disorders. Other terms that have been used to describe complicated grief include chronic grief, complex grief, pathological grief, persistent complex bereavement disorder, prolonged grief disorder, traumatic grief, and unresolved grief. (See <a href=\"#H4668493\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mourning</strong> &ndash; Mourning is the process of adapting to a loss and integrating grief. Adaptation entails accepting the finality and consequences of the loss, revising the internalized relationship with deceased, and re-envisioning the future such that there is a possibility for happiness in a world without the deceased. When mourning is successful, the painful and disruptive experience of acute grief is transformed into an experience of integrated grief that is bittersweet and in the background. Like grief, mourning is influenced by cultural and religious rituals.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4668463\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The estimated point prevalence of complicated grief among the bereaved in the general population is 7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complicated-grief-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. However, this should be considered provisional, given the absence of standard criteria for complicated grief. In addition, most studies of complicated grief do not utilize population-based representative samples.</p><p>The prevalence of complicated grief varies depending upon the relationship to the deceased, as well as the setting (including country). Among bereaved individuals who lose a spouse, the estimated rate of complicated grief is 10 to 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complicated-grief-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,9</a>], whereas one study found that the rate in parents in Western countries who lost a child was as high as 60 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complicated-grief-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Studies of suicide, homicide, and disaster-related bereavement generally report rates of complicated grief ranging from 20 to 40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complicated-grief-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4668469\"><span class=\"h2\">General population</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The estimated overall prevalence of complicated grief in the general population is 2 to 5 percent; among the subset of individuals who are bereaved, the best estimate is 7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complicated-grief-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]; however, the rate varies, possibly reflecting different methods of identifying the syndrome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4668475\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical settings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complicated grief often occurs in psychiatric settings.

In addition, bereaved individuals with active serious medical problems <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> severe interpersonal or financial problems may be at increased risk.</p><p>Insecure attachment style (anxious or avoidant) may also be a risk factor for complicated grief, especially when there was a strong positive relationship with the deceased. Those with anxious attachment worry that others will not be available in times of need, while those with avoidant attachment are highly self-reliant and emotionally distant from others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complicated-grief-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/9,10,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10,23</a>]. Insecure attachment styles develop during childhood and may be due to experiences with caregivers who are inconsistent, inaccessible, or unresponsive, or other early traumas or losses.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H197913\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of complicated grief is not known. However, preliminary studies suggest that the neurobiology of complicated grief may differ from that of typical acute grief [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complicated-grief-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Several psychological models of complicated grief have been proposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complicated-grief-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], including a model based upon loss of an attachment relationship [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complicated-grief-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/23,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4668487\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurobiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complicated grief may be associated with a distinct neurobiological profile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complicated-grief-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In one study, investigators used functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of bereaved women (complicated grief, n = 11; integrated grief, n = 12) to examine the effects of idiographic cues of the deceased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complicated-grief-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Both groups showed neural activity in brain regions linked to pain (eg, anterior cingulate cortex). However, activity in the nucleus accumbens, which is associated with reward, was greater in women with complicated grief than women with noncomplicated grief. The investigators hypothesized that activation of central nervous system reward centers by reminders of the deceased may interfere with adapting to the loss.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H86316201\"><span class=\"h2\">Loss of an attachment relationship</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The attachment system motivates people throughout life to form close relationships with a few other people [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complicated-grief-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/23,26,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,26,28,29</a>]. People provide and receive emotional security and support in close relationships, and loved ones contribute to regulation of emotions and physiologic functioning. The loss of an attachment relationship often entails intense activation of emotions. Adaptation to the loss includes a process of incorporating the reality of the death into the bereaved person&rsquo;s mental representation (memory networks) of the deceased person. It is thought that complicated grief occurs when the process of adaptation to a loss is slowed or stalled. Maladaptive thoughts, dysfunctional behaviors, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> inadequate regulation of emotions, which may occur in the context of severe environmental stress or in the presence of co-occurring psychiatric or medical illness, can slow or stall the adaptive process. The result is that mourners are diverted from coming to terms with the loss <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> engaging meaningfully in ongoing life. Additional information about loss of attachment and bereavement is discussed separately.

Studies in unipolar major depression indicate that screening is beneficial only in settings that can provide follow-up to confirm the diagnosis and provide effective treatment. In addition, complicated grief is generally not diagnosed until at least six months have elapsed after the loss; while patients with significant acute grief (within the first six months after the loss) may score high on screening instruments, this is not necessarily indicative of future difficulties. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2461684850\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic instruments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Structured Clinical Interview for Complicated Grief is a structured, interviewer-administered instrument that is available for diagnosing complicated grief and has good psychometric properties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complicated-grief-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]; however, it is rarely used in routine clinical practice.

These include intense yearning for the deceased, wishes to be reunited with the lost loved one, behaviors enacted to feel close to the deceased, intrusive or preoccupying thoughts of the deceased, intense emotions activated by reminders of the loss, and efforts to avoid these reminders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complicated-grief-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/2,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,30</a>].</p><p>Additional information about the clinical features, assessment, and diagnosis of major depression (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F89994\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89994 \">table 3</a>) is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-depression-in-adults-clinical-features\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar depression in adults: Clinical features&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-depression-in-adults-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar depression in adults: Assessment and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1954477\"><span class=\"h2\">Posttraumatic stress disorder</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complicated grief also needs to be differentiated from PTSD, especially among individuals who experience the violent or accidental death of a loved one. Both disorders can be characterized by a sense of shock, intrusive images, avoiding stimuli associated with the death, feeling estranged from others, insomnia, and impaired concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complicated-grief-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,2,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,30</a>].</p><p>One distinction is that the hallmark of PTSD is fear (that the traumatic event will occur again or that the world is unsafe) and horror, whereas the primary emotional state in complicated grief is sadness and yearning (ie, separation distress over the absence of the deceased) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complicated-grief-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,2,8,30,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,8,30,74</a>]. Hypervigilance to threat, excessive startle response, and nightmares often occur in PTSD, but are not typically seen in complicated grief. To the extent that hypervigilance occurs in complicated grief, it is directed toward searching for reminders of the deceased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complicated-grief-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. Yearning for the deceased and seeking proximity to the deceased (eg, the wish to die in order to join the deceased) are usually not observed in PTSD, but are often seen in complicated grief [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complicated-grief-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/2,30,63,74\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,30,63,74</a>].</p><p>The intrusive thoughts that occur in PTSD involve distressing memories of the traumatic event, whereas complicated grief intrusions are focused upon thoughts of the deceased, and are often positive or even comforting. In addition, patients with PTSD avoid fear-inducing stimuli because they feel threatened, whereas avoidance behavior in complicated grief involves efforts to avert painful sadness and yearning brought about by reminders of the loss.</p><p>Additional information about the clinical features, assessment, and diagnosis of PTSD (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F57500\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57500 \">table 4</a>) is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-adults-epidemiology-pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-course-assessment-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Posttraumatic stress disorder in adults: Epidemiology, pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, course, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4668595\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bereavement is the situation in which a loved one has died, and grief is the distress that occurs in response to bereavement. Acute grief can be intense and disruptive but usually is integrated over time. Complicated grief is a form of acute grief that is abnormally prolonged, intense, and disabling; as such, complicated grief is a unique and recognizable mental disorder. (See <a href=\"#H86315645\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The estimated incidence of complicated grief in the general population is 2 to 5 percent; among the subset of individuals who are bereaved, the estimate is 7 percent. However, the rate varies depending upon the method of assessment as well as aspects of the loss such as the relationship to the deceased, the age of the deceased, and the circumstances of the death. (See <a href=\"#H4668463\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pathogenesis of complicated grief is not known. However, studies suggest that the neurobiology of complicated grief may be distinct from that of integrated grief. (See <a href=\"#H197913\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The symptoms of complicated grief include acute grief lasting at least 6 to 12 months after the loss, with yearning for the deceased, sorrow, emotional pain, difficulty envisioning a meaningful life without the deceased, and disbelief. These symptoms are accompanied by maladaptive ruminative thoughts and dysfunctional behaviors (excessively seeking proximity to the deceased <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> excessively avoiding reminders of the deceased), and poor functioning. Suicidal ideation and behavior occurs in approximately 40 to 60 percent of patients. Comorbidity in complicated grief includes unipolar major depression, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> substance use disorders. Complicated grief may persist for years or decades after the loss of a loved one. (See <a href=\"#H4668493\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial evaluation for patients with a possible diagnosis of complicated grief includes a psychiatric history, mental status examination, general medical history, physical examination, and focused laboratory tests. All patients with complicated grief must be queried specifically about suicidal ideation and behavior. The diagnosis of complicated grief can be facilitated by screening bereaved individuals with the Brief Grief Questionnaire (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F94493\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94493 \">table 1</a>); patients who screen positive require an interview to establish the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H4668511\" class=\"local\">'Assessment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest diagnosing complicated grief according to research criteria that perform well in treatment studies as well community samples. (See <a href=\"#H210445955\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic criteria'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of complicated grief includes typical acute grief, bereavement-related major depression, and bereavement-related PTSD. (See <a href=\"#H4668589\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complicated-grief-in-adults-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Shear MK, Simon N, Wall M, et al.
