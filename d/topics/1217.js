The other causes range from mild, self-limited conditions to sight-threatening ocular emergencies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63904\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63904 \">table 1</a>). Associated signs and symptoms usually help to narrow the differential diagnosis and permit appropriate triage of children with these complaints.</p><p>The anatomy of the lacrimal system and the differential diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment for persistent tearing in infants and children are reviewed here. Nasolacrimal duct obstruction and conjunctivitis are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-nasolacrimal-duct-obstruction-dacryostenosis-and-dacryocystocele\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction (dacryostenosis) and dacryocystocele&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=conjunctivitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Conjunctivitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY OF THE LACRIMAL SYSTEM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The function of tears is to keep the ocular surface moist and flushed clear of debris and bacteria. The tear film is partly responsible for corneal clarity and the transmission of a focused image to the retina.</p><p>Tears are produced by the lacrimal and accessory lacrimal glands and drain through the lacrimal drainage system, which begins at the punctum, a small opening on the medial surface of each eyelid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53429\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53429 \">figure 1</a>). The punctum is the opening of the canaliculus, which drains into the common canaliculus and then into the lacrimal sac. There are two canaliculi for each eye. Tears that collect in the lacrimal sac drain through the nasolacrimal duct and into the nose via the inferior meatus, located below the inferior turbinate. The valve of Hasner, a mucosal flap at the distal end of the nasolacrimal duct, prevents air from entering the lacrimal sac when the nose is blown; the valve of Hasner is called the &quot;membrane of Hasner&quot; if it hasn't opened. Tears are swallowed after they pass from the nose into the posterior pharynx.</p><p>Tear drainage is both passive and active. Gravity is responsible for passive drainage. Blinking facilitates active drainage by causing negative pressure in the canaliculus and lacrimal sac; the negative pressure draws tears into the lacrimal drainage system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-persistent-tearing/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Tear production</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tears are produced by the lacrimal and accessory lacrimal glands. The lacrimal glands are located in the <span class=\"nowrap\">upper/outer</span> quadrant of the orbit and produce &quot;reflex&quot; tears when the eye is irritated or stimulated by emotions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-persistent-tearing/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The accessory lacrimal glands are scattered along the conjunctiva of the eyelid and produce the basal (resting) tears that keep the eye moist.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Tear composition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The tear film is composed of three layers, each of different composition. The inner mucin layer smooths the surface of the eye and makes it wettable. The middle aqueous layer consists primarily of water and provides the bulk of the tear film. The outer lipid layer coats the other layers to slow evaporation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-persistent-tearing/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The tear film has several functions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prevention of drying of the cornea and mucosal surfaces</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Smoothing of the refractive surface of the eye (the cornea)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lubrication of the ocular surface for ease of eyelid closure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Protection from infection through secretory antibodies</p><p/><p>The tear meniscus or tear lake is a small layer of tears above the lower eyelid that rests against the cornea and conjunctiva. Excessive tearing (epiphora) causes the level of the tear meniscus to elevate, and the tears flow over the eyelids onto the face.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY OF PERSISTENT TEARING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The causes of persistent tearing range from mild, self-limited conditions to sight-threatening ocular emergencies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63904\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63904 \">table 1</a>). Associated signs and symptoms usually help to narrow the differential diagnosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Nasolacrimal duct obstruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nasolacrimal duct (NLD) obstruction (dacryostenosis) is the most common cause of tearing in children, occurring up to 20 percent of all normal newborns and causing symptoms in up to 6 percent of children during the first year of life.</p><p>Infants with NLD obstruction present with a history of chronic or intermittent tearing, debris on the eyelashes (mattering), and occasionally, redness of the conjunctiva (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F62518\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62518 \">picture 1</a>). On physical examination, the infant may have an increase in the size of the tear meniscus. Palpation of the lacrimal sac may cause reflux of tears <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mucoid discharge into the eye through the puncta.</p><p>Nasolacrimal duct obstruction is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-nasolacrimal-duct-obstruction-dacryostenosis-and-dacryocystocele\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital nasolacrimal duct obstruction (dacryostenosis) and dacryocystocele&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Glaucoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Congenital or early-onset glaucoma is a sight-threatening condition and usually requires surgery for definitive treatment. It typically presents with chronic or intermittent tearing, photophobia, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> corneal clouding. The corneal clouding is caused by corneal edema resulting from increased intraocular pressure and endothelial cell dysfunction. Corneal edema causes tremendous glare, which leads to photophobia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-glaucoma-in-infants-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of glaucoma in infants and children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-infantile-glaucoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary infantile glaucoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Increased intraocular pressure also can cause stretching of the cornea and sclera in children younger than three years. This stretching increases the size of the globe (buphthalmos, or &quot;ox eye&quot;). Increased corneal size that occurs with buphthalmos helps to distinguish congenital or early-onset glaucoma from other conditions that cause tearing. The normal corneal diameter is 10 mm in infants and increases to 12 mm by two years of age. A horizontal corneal diameter of more than 12 mm or diameters that differ between the two eyes is abnormal and is suggestive of glaucoma. Infants and children with these findings require prompt referral to an ophthalmologist.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Uveitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Uveitis is an inflammation of the pigmented portion of the eye (the iris, ciliary body, and choroid). This condition is also called iritis or iridocyclitis. Uveitis can occur after blunt ocular trauma and in association with certain rheumatologic or systemic conditions (eg, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, Kawasaki disease, lupus, granulomatosis with polyangiitis [Wegener's], HLA-B27). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uveitis-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uveitis: Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Children with uveitis typically complain of photophobia; deep, boring ocular pain; redness; tearing; and other signs. The onset may be acute or insidious.</p><p>On examination, the eyes are of normal size. Conjunctival injection, particularly of the area surrounding the limbus (ciliary injection), may be present. Slit lamp findings include anterior chamber cells and flare, posterior synechia, and keratic precipitants. Band keratopathy may occur in patients with chronic uveitis.</p><p>The first episode of uveitis is typically treated with topical or systemic antiinflammatory medications and cycloplegic agents. Recurrent uveitis often is associated with autoimmune disorders (eg, juvenile idiopathic arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, HLA-B27-related spondyloarthropathies) or infections (eg, tuberculosis, syphilis). Laboratory evaluation for these disorders should be performed in children with recurrent uveitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Conjunctivitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conjunctivitis (inflammation of the conjunctiva) is caused by infection, allergy, chemical exposure, or mechanical aggravation. The signs, symptoms, and treatment vary depending upon the etiology. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=conjunctivitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Conjunctivitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Bacterial infection typically causes a purulent discharge and diffuse conjunctival injection. It is treated with topical, and sometimes systemic, antibiotics.</p><p>Viral infection typically causes a watery or stringy discharge, itching, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mild photophobia. It is often preceded by a respiratory infection; an enlarged, tender preauricular lymph node may be present. Viral conjunctivitis is treated with symptomatic relief, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=artificial-tears-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">artificial tears</a> and cold compresses.</p><p>Allergic conjunctivitis typically is pruritic; patients also have other allergic stigmata (eg, allergic shiners). Allergic conjunctivitis is treated with topical antihistamines and topical mast cell suppressors and stabilizers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergic-conjunctivitis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Allergic conjunctivitis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Mechanical and chemical conjunctivitis usually are indicated by the history. Mechanical and chemical conjunctivitis typically are treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=artificial-tears-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">artificial tears</a> and lubrication for symptomatic relief.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Ophthalmia neonatorum</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ophthalmia neonatorum is a specific conjunctivitis that occurs during the first month of life. It may be associated with systemic illness and typically is caused by gonorrhea, chlamydia, or bacteria resident to the skin or gastrointestinal system.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gonococcal conjunctivitis usually presents with copious discharge at two to five days of age. The discharge is hyperpurulent (ie, reaccumulates in a matter of minutes). Gonococcal conjunctivitis must be treated immediately because it can lead to corneal ulceration and perforation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gonococcal-infection-in-the-newborn#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gonococcal infection in the newborn&quot;, section on 'Ophthalmia neonatorum'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chlamydial conjunctivitis typically presents with a stringy mucopurulent discharge within the first 10 to 14 days of life. It can be associated with pneumonitis and other systemic infections. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlamydia-trachomatis-infections-in-the-newborn\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chlamydia trachomatis infections in the newborn&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conjunctivitis caused by bacteria of the skin or gastrointestinal tract can mimic gonococcal conjunctivitis with purulent discharge and onset between two and five days of life.</p><p/><p>Ophthalmia neonatorum is treated aggressively because neonates have a high risk for sepsis and other secondary complications. Determination of specific treatment depends upon the etiologic agent. Cultures of the eye discharge and other potential sites of infection should be obtained to confirm the diagnosis and determine antimicrobial sensitivity. However, empiric therapy to treat gonorrhea and chlamydia should be started immediately after cultures are performed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlamydia-trachomatis-infections-in-the-newborn\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chlamydia trachomatis infections in the newborn&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gonococcal-infection-in-the-newborn\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gonococcal infection in the newborn&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Occult foreign body or abrasion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children who have an occult corneal foreign body or abrasion usually present with photophobia, tearing, redness, and a history that is suggestive of a mechanism of injury. Foreign bodies may be present on the surface of the cornea or on the bulbar or palpebral conjunctiva. Those that are under the upper eyelid may cause vertically oriented linear corneal abrasions. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorescein-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Fluorescein</a> examination may reveal the corneal abrasions; the foreign body is viewed either directly or with the slit lamp. Eversion of the upper lid should be performed if the foreign body is not evident on the cornea. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=corneal-abrasions-and-corneal-foreign-bodies-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Corneal abrasions and corneal foreign bodies: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Corneal foreign bodies should be removed by an ophthalmologist if they are not easily removed with irrigation or a cotton-tipped applicator. Topical antibiotics are indicated if infection is suspected (after culture is obtained). Corneal abrasions may be treated with a pressure patch (for comfort) only if no sign or risk of infection is present. The child with either of these conditions should be followed until all abrasions and other corneal defects heal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Eyelid abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anatomic abnormalities of the eyelids may cause tearing, redness, and foreign body sensation. Trichiasis (ingrown eyelashes) can irritate the cornea, causing reflex tearing and redness, and may be caused by entropion or epiblepharon. Entropion is the in-turning of the eyelid; epiblepharon is a fold of skin along the lower lid margin, just below the eyelashes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75573\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75573 \">picture 2</a>). Both of these conditions can be associated with trichiasis. Entropion, if significant, is treated with surgical repair. Children usually outgrow epiblepharon by two to three years of age without needing to undergo surgery.</p><p>Blepharitis, inflammation or infection of the eyelids, can cause mattering, itching, burning, tearing, and redness. The treatment is determined by the cause but may include lid scrubs and antibiotics. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blepharitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blepharitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Trauma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Trauma to the canaliculus or the nasolacrimal duct (eg, as may occur with a lid laceration or facial bone fracture) may lead to complete or partial obstruction of the lacrimal system if the nasolacrimal duct or lacrimal sac is injured, repositioned, or heals with stenosis. These injuries require surgical treatment <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> stent placement to reestablish and preserve a patent lacrimal drainage system.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION OF THE CHILD WITH PERSISTENT TEARING</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pertinent features of the patient's history will help to distinguish the likely diagnosis among the possible causes of tearing in infants and children (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63904\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63904 \">table 1</a>). The age of the child will help to narrow the differential diagnosis. As an example, NLD obstruction is the most common cause of tearing in children younger than one year of age, whereas conjunctivitis is more common in school-age children. The examiner should ask about the timing and duration of the symptoms, what remedies have been tried, and whether the remedies were successful.</p><p>The presence or absence of associated signs or symptoms and exacerbating factors also are helpful:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Photophobia is common in uveitis and glaucoma</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ocular itching is common in allergic conjunctivitis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The color, quantity, and quality of the discharge help to distinguish among blepharitis, viral conjunctivitis, bacterial conjunctivitis, or NLD obstruction</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deep, boring pain may occur with uveitis or acute glaucoma</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Foreign body sensation occurs with corneal abrasion, occult foreign body, and trichiasis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Upper respiratory tract symptoms often are present with viral conjunctivitis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Onset of tearing during an upper respiratory infection suggests obstruction from nasal congestion; this obstruction usually is temporary</p><p/><p>The past medical history should be obtained and recorded.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Juvenile idiopathic arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and other autoimmune disorders are associated with uveitis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bony obstruction of the lacrimal drainage system occurs commonly in children with craniofacial syndromes (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syndromes-with-craniofacial-abnormalities\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syndromes with craniofacial abnormalities&quot;</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Past facial or orbital trauma or facial surgery may contribute to obstruction of the lacrimal drainage system</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children with asthma and allergic rhinitis often have allergic conjunctivitis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic and topical medications may affect tear production and drainage, cause conjunctival or corneal toxicity, and contribute to increased tearing</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When possible, visual acuity testing should be performed in all children with persistent tearing. Abnormal visual behavior in a child with tearing can indicate a vision-threatening disease (eg, congenital glaucoma). A comprehensive eye examination includes examination of the ocular adnexa, the anterior segment, pupils, confrontation visual fields, ocular motility, intraocular pressure, and fundus. Findings in the ocular adnexa and anterior segment are particularly important in the child with persistent tearing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=visual-development-and-vision-assessment-in-infants-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Visual development and vision assessment in infants and children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Ocular adnexa</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evaluation of the ocular adnexa includes examination of the eyelids (for blepharitis), eyelashes (for trichiasis), eyebrows, lacrimal glands, and lacrimal fossa, as well as palpation of the orbital bones. The examination of the lacrimal drainage apparatus is critical because most problems that cause tearing in children are related to lacrimal drainage apparatus abnormalities.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The eyelids can be gently everted to evaluate for the presence of a punctum in the medial corner of each eyelid</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of anomalous lacrimal ducts that exit to the skin should be noted (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64530\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64530 \">picture 3</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of redness or swelling near the punctum and discharge from the punctum should be noted</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The lacrimal sac, beneath the medial canthal tendon, should be inspected and palpated; swelling <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> redness of the lacrimal sac and discharge expressed from the punctum should be noted</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Anterior segment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The anterior segment consists of the conjunctiva, cornea, anterior chamber, iris, and lens. Although the anterior chamber is best examined with a slit lamp, the pediatric health care provider can use a penlight with or without a magnifying lens (eg, a 20 diopter condensing lens).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The conjunctiva is examined for signs of inflammation (eg, redness, chemosis, discharge).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The cornea is inspected for corneal abrasion, foreign body, scar, or signs of uveitis (eg, keratic precipitants, band keratopathy). The diameter of the cornea should be measured; a horizontal corneal diameter greater than 12 mm or a diameter that is different for each eye is suggestive of glaucoma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The anterior chamber is examined for inflammation (eg, cells and flare) or a cloudy appearance in the normally clear aqueous humor caused by white blood cells and proteinaceous exudate in the anterior chamber.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The intraocular pressure should be measured to rule out glaucoma in children with tearing who also have photophobia and increased corneal diameter, or cloudiness of the cornea consistent with corneal edema. Tactile intraocular pressure may be assessed by digital examination by experienced examiners, but tonometry is preferred. Cooperation of the child is essential. Examination under anesthesia may be necessary if a strong suspicion of glaucoma exists. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-glaucoma-in-infants-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of glaucoma in infants and children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECIAL TESTING OF THE LACRIMAL SYSTEM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Special tests of tear function and drainage may be indicated if an abnormality of the lacrimal drainage system is suspected.

The dye disappearance test is not always necessary. It is particularly helpful when the symptoms are intermittent. The test is performed in the following manner:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Place a drop of fluorescein-stained saline in the inferior cul-de-sac of each of the patient's eyes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wipe away the excess tears from the eyelids.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Observe the patient for five minutes.

One of two events occurs if the nasolacrimal system is obstructed: the dye may remain in the eye and be visible as a bright green tear meniscus, or the dye may escape over the eyelid and drain down the cheek. The test is normal if most of the dye is gone within five minutes and abnormal if a large amount of the dye persists or has drained over the lower eyelid and down the cheek.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Basal secretion test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The basal secretion test is used to evaluate basal tear production by the accessory lacrimal glands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-persistent-tearing/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The test is performed in the following manner:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Place a drop of topical anesthetic in the inferior cul-de-sac of each eye to anesthetize the eye and decrease the production of reflex tears.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wipe away the excess tears.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Place a Whatman 41 filter paper strip, also called a Schirmer strip, into each inferior cul-de-sac between the eyelid and the conjunctiva near the temporal corner of the lower eyelid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52623\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52623 \">picture 4</a>).

Reflex tearing is considered normal if between 10 and 25 mm of the strip is moistened after five minutes; greater than 25 mm of wetting indicates excessive tearing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Tear breakup time</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The tear breakup time test provides information about the composition and function of the tears [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-child-with-persistent-tearing/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The tear breakup time is the length of time that the tear film forms an unbroken sheet of fluid over the cornea. The normal tear film forms an unbroken sheet of fluid over the cornea for at least 10 seconds before separating into its component layers. The tear breakup time is reduced in patients with an imbalance of components in the tear film; patients with such an imbalance often blink at an increased rate. The tear breakup time test requires a cooperative child and a slit lamp; it is performed as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Place a drop of fluorescein-stained saline in the inferior cul-de-sac of each of the patient's eyes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wipe away the excess tears</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Place the child's head into the slit lamp in the normal fashion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Focus on the cornea using the cobalt blue light of the slit lamp</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have the child blink two or three times and then keep his or her eyes open for approximately 15 seconds</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Observe the tear film</p><p/><p>The surface of the tear film should remain smooth, and the green color of the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorescein-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fluorescein</a> dye should remain uniform for at least 10 seconds. Dry spots eventually develop on the cornea and appear as dark areas surrounded by the green of the fluorescein in the remainder of the tear film. The tear composition may be out of balance if dry spots are seen sooner than 10 seconds after the last blink.</p><p>Imbalance of tear composition is caused by autoimmune disorders such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Graves' disease, and scleroderma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients.
