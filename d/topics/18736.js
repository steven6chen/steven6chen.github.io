Biopsies of lesional skin reveal a loss of epidermal melanocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. Lesions may occur in a localized or generalized distribution and may coalesce into large, depigmented areas. Given the contrast between the white areas and normal skin, the disease is most disfiguring in darker skin types and has a profound impact on the quality of life of both children and adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Patients with vitiligo often experience stigmatization, social isolation, and low self-esteem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>].</p><p>This topic will review the pathogenesis, classification, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of vitiligo.

Estimated prevalence rates range from 0.1 to 2 percent in both adults and children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/12-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-16</a>]. Vitiligo affects equally males and females, without racial, ethnic, or socio-economic predilections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. It may appear at any age from early childhood to late adulthood, with peak incidences in the second and third decade of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Approximately one-third of patients with vitiligo are children, and 70 to 80 percent of adult patients develop vitiligo prior to age 30 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14676582\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The etiology of vitiligo is unknown. Patients commonly attribute the onset of their disease to specific triggering events such as physical injury or illness, sunburn, emotional stress, or pregnancy, but there are no data supporting a causative role for these factors. The frequency of comorbid autoimmune diseases is significantly elevated in patients with vitiligo and in their first-degree relatives, suggesting an autoimmune etiology for this disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Recipients of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) appear to have an increased risk of developing vitiligo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. In a Korean nationwide population study including 2747 HSCT recipients and 8241 controls, HSCT recipients had a three-fold increased risk of having vitiligo compared with controls (odds ratio 3.13, 95% CI 1.86-5.27) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Allogeneic HSCT and bone marrow-sourced stem cells were independently associated with the development of vitiligo after HSCT. The pathogenetic mechanisms underlying the development of vitiligo in HSCT recipients are unclear. They may include adoptive transfer of vitiligo from donor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], immunosuppression associated with preparative regimens, or chronic graft-versus-host disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1838574476\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple theories have been proposed for melanocyte destruction in vitiligo. These include genetic, autoimmune, neural, biochemical, oxidative stress, viral infection, and melanocyte detachment mechanisms. Although the autoimmune and oxidative stress theories are best supported by research data, none of the proposed theories are in themselves sufficient to explain the diverse vitiligo phenotypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/3,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,23,24</a>]. The so-called &quot;convergence theory&quot; suggests that multiple mechanisms may contribute to the disappearance of melanocytes in vitiliginous skin and that vitiligo may indeed represent a disease spectrum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1838574482\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Family clustering of vitiligo suggests a genetic basis for the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/13,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,26</a>]. Genetic studies indicate a non-Mendelian, multifactorial, polygenic inheritance pattern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. Twenty-five to 50 percent of persons with vitiligo have affected relatives, and approximately 6 percent have siblings with the disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/13,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,26</a>]. A survey conducted among 2624 vitiligo patients from North America and the United Kingdom found a 6 percent prevalence of vitiligo in siblings of patients with vitiligo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In this cohort, the concordance in monozygotic twins was only 23 percent, suggesting that nongenetic factors <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> environmental triggers play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease.</p><p>Genetic studies have identified approximately 36 susceptibility loci for nonsegmental vitiligo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The majority of the susceptibility genes encode immunoregulatory proteins, whereas several encode melanocyte proteins. Multiple studies have also implicated human leukocyte antigen loci in vitiligo, including A2, DR4, DR7, DQ7, DR1, B13, DQW3, CW6, and A30 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/24,27,28,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,27,28,31,32</a>]. In genome-wide association studies, several genes with known associations with other autoimmune disorders were identified as potential susceptibility loci for generalized vitiligo, including <em>PTPN22</em>, <em>LPP</em>, <em>IL2RA</em>, <em>UBASH3A</em>, <em>C1QTNF6</em>, and genes encoding major histocompatibility complex (MHC) I and MHC II molecules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/16,17,23,24,33-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17,23,24,33-36</a>].</p><p>However, there is significant genetic heterogeneity in different ethnic groups. A genome-wide linkage study performed in 71 white multiplex families with vitiligo found highly significant linkage to the autoimmune disease susceptibility locus <em>AIS1</em> on chromosome 1p31, suggesting that <em>AIS1 </em>is a major susceptibility locus in Caucasians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In contrast, genetic studies in Chinese families have shown linkage evidence to chromosome 4q13-q21 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>Other candidate genes for vitiligo susceptibility include the catalase gene, vitiligo-associated protein 1 on chromosome 2p16, and the guanosine triphosphate cyclohydrolase I gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/23,27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,27,28</a>]. The <em>NALP1</em> gene on chromosome 17p13, encoding the NACHT leucine-rich repeat protein 1, a regulator of the innate immune system, has been linked to vitiligo-associated multiple autoimmune disease, a group of diseases including various combinations of vitiligo, autoimmune thyroid disease, and other autoimmune and autoinflammatory syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H963463807\"><span class=\"h2\">Autoimmunity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Historically, vitiligo has been associated with several autoimmune diseases, including Hashimoto's thyroiditis, Graves' disease, type 1 diabetes mellitus, alopecia areata, pernicious anemia, rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune polyglandular syndrome, and psoriasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/17,24,39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,24,39,40</a>]. A survey in North America and the United Kingdom found that approximately 20 percent of 2624 vitiligo probands had a history of autoimmune thyroid disease compared with 2 percent of the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Many humoral and cell-mediated immune aberrations have been reported in vitiligo patients, including an increased frequency of organ-specific autoantibodies, such as antithyroglobulin, antithyroid peroxidase, antiparietal cells, and antinuclear antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. The presence of antibodies to surface and cytoplasmic melanocyte antigens in the sera of vitiligo patients lends additional support to the autoimmune pathogenesis of this disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/43-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-45</a>]. These antibodies can induce the destruction of melanocytes grown in culture by complement-mediated lysis and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. In addition, melanocyte antibodies, when passively administered to nude mice grafted with human skin, have a destructive effect on melanocytes within the skin graft [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>Studies also suggest that cytotoxic T lymphocytes may play a significant role in melanocyte destruction in vitiligo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Numerous activated cytotoxic T lymphocytes have been reported in the perilesional area of the vitiliginous skin, often in apposition to disappearing melanocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. These infiltrating lymphocytes are predominantly cytotoxic CD8<sup>+</sup> lymphocytes that express the skin homing receptor cutaneous leucocyte-associated antigen receptor. Moreover, purified CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells isolated from lesional skin of vitiligo patients can induce melanocyte apoptosis in autologous nonlesional skin explants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>].</p><p>Multiple cytokines have also been implicated in the destruction of melanocytes in vitiligo. Several studies have documented increased expression of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interferon-gamma, interleukin (IL)-10, and IL-17 in lesional skin of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Investigations suggest that the interferon gamma-induced chemokine CXCL-10 is a key mediator of melanocyte destruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1838574488\"><span class=\"h2\">Melanocyte self-destruction hypothesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The self-destruction hypothesis proposes that melanocytes may be destroyed from an intrinsic increased sensitivity to oxidative stress arising from toxic phenolic compounds formed during the synthesis of melanin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that a number of ubiquitous compounds containing catechols, phenols, and sulfhydryls (eg, industrial chemicals, cleaning agents, some hair dyes) can induce hypopigmentation, depigmentation, or both. Possible mechanisms for altered pigment production by these compounds include melanocyte destruction via free-radical formation, inhibition of tyrosinase activity, and interference with the production or transfer of melanosomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Additional data suggest that phenols can activate the unfolded protein response in melanocytes, causing induction of factor X-box binding protein 1, which leads to the production of IL-6 and IL-8 and recruitment of immune cells to the affected areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3334777129\"><span class=\"h2\">Oxidative stress hypothesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several studies suggest that oxidative stress may be the initial event in the destruction of melanocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>]. An imbalance of intracellular redox status and a significant depletion of enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidants have been demonstrated in the epidermis of patients with active vitiligo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Low catalase and glutathione levels (but increased superoxide dismutase and xanthine oxidase levels) have also been found in the peripheral blood of patients with vitiligo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>Defective recycling of 6-tetrahydrobiopterin (6BH4), increased production of hydrogen peroxide, and decreased catalase levels have also been found in lesional skin of patients with vitiligo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/54,55,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55,57</a>]. The altered tetrahydrobiopterin homeostasis may result in increased levels of toxic metabolites (eg, 6BH4 and 7-tetrahydrobiopterin) and hydrogen peroxide and reduced levels of catalase, a key enzyme involved in hydrogen peroxide removal, which may further contribute to cell death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p>Oxidative stress may also contribute to melanocyte destruction in susceptible individuals via activation of the innate immune response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Reactive oxygen species can act as danger signals and activate pattern recognition receptors to initiate inflammation, with local recruitment of innate immune cell populations, such as macrophages, natural killer cells, and inflammatory dendritic cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1838574500\"><span class=\"h2\">Neural hypothesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The neural hypothesis posits that nerve endings situated near pigment cells may secrete a neurochemical mediator that is cytotoxic to the melanocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that the distribution of the depigmented areas in segmental vitiligo is related to dermatomes, even though the segments are almost never strictly dermatomal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/24,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,59</a>]. Moreover, vitiligo has been reported following neurologic disorders such as viral encephalitis, multiple sclerosis with Horner syndrome, and peripheral nerve injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/24,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,60</a>]. Laboratory findings also support the neural hypothesis. Axon degeneration has been seen in dermal nerves of vitiliginous skin but not in dermal nerves of normal skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Immunohistochemistry studies of nerve endings in skin surrounding vitiligo lesions have shown abnormalities in the expression of nerve growth factors and neuropeptides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Blood levels of certain neuropeptides are increased among patients with active vitiligo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1655559738\"><span class=\"h2\">Melanocytorrhagy hypothesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This theory proposes that melanocyte loss in vitiligo is secondary to chronic melanocyte detachment from the basement membrane.

Severe sunburn, pregnancy, skin trauma, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> emotional stress may precede the disease onset. Lesions can appear at any age and anywhere on the body, with a predilection for the face and areas around the orifices, genitals, and hands. They vary in size from a few millimeters to many centimeters and usually have convex borders well-demarcated from the surrounding normal skin.</p><p>Vitiligo may show more than one color shade. Trichrome lesions are characterized by zones of white, light-brown, and normal skin color and are most often observed in darker-complexioned individuals. Quadrichrome lesions may have a perifollicular or marginal hyperpigmentation, whereas pentachrome lesions present also a blue hue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/12,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,66</a>]. Another clinical variant is the so-called vitiligo ponctu&eacute;, which exhibits tiny, confetti-like depigmented macules.</p><p>Depigmented hairs are often present in lesional skin. While such hairs indicate a reduction or loss of the follicular reservoir for repigmentation, their presence does not invariably preclude the repigmentation of a lesion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F106464\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef106464 \">picture 2</a>). Poliosis, a decrease or absence of melanin or color in head hair, eyebrows, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> eyelashes, may also be a manifestation of vitiligo (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F53173\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53173 \">picture 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vitiligo-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H1838574464\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1838574470\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple theories have been proposed to explain melanocyte destruction in vitiligo. These include genetic susceptibility, autoimmunity, and oxidative stress. (See <a href=\"#H1838574476\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vitiligo typically presents with asymptomatic depigmented macules and patches that lack clinical signs of inflammation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F106463\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef106463 \">picture 1</a>). Lesions can appear at any age and anywhere on the body. Based upon the distribution pattern of depigmented lesions, vitiligo is classified into two broad categories, segmental (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F105859\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef105859 \">picture 7</a>) and nonsegmental (most common), and in several subtypes, such as generalized, acral or acrofacial, and universal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F107278\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107278 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1089039858\" class=\"local\">'General features'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1414966922\" class=\"local\">'Clinical classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vitiligo is frequently associated with autoimmune thyroid disease. Alopecia areata, psoriasis, inflammatory bowel disease, and several other autoimmune and genetic disorders have also been linked to vitiligo. (See <a href=\"#H3689237287\" class=\"local\">'Associated disorders'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of vitiligo is in most cases made clinically. A skin biopsy can be performed in patients with hypopigmented or depigmented lesions of uncertain etiology. Given the relatively high frequency with which autoimmune thyroid disease occurs in patients with vitiligo, it is reasonable to screen all patients with vitiligo for thyroid function.
