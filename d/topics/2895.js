In particular, the question of whether or not stimulant drugs increase the risk of adverse cardiovascular events has led to a debate on the appropriate evaluation to identify patients with undiagnosed at-risk congenital heart disease <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> arrhythmias prior to starting a patient on medications for the treatment of ADHD.</p><p>The risk of sudden cardiac death in patients receiving stimulant medications for ADHD and the cardiac evaluation of these patients will be reviewed here. The pharmacotherapy for ADHD is discussed in greater detail separately.

Stimulant drugs including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylphenidate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methylphenidate</a> (Ritalin, Methylin, Concerta, Focalin, Metadate), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dextroamphetamine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">dextroamphetamine</a> (Dexedrine), and mixed amphetamine salts (eg, Adderall) are effective in improving behavior in these patients.

However, large cohort studies have not shown an increased risk of serious CV adverse events in children treated with stimulant therapy compared with the general pediatric population, as discussed in the following section.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Children without cardiac disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based on the available evidence, it appears that children without cardiac disease who receive stimulant therapy are <strong>not</strong> at increased risk for CV events compared with the general pediatric population. </p><p>In the largest cohort study based on data from four large health plans that was sponsored by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Agency for Healthcare Research, there was no difference in the risk for serious CV events (sudden cardiac death, acute myocardial infarction, or stroke) between children and young adults (age range, 2 to 24 years) receiving stimulant ADHD pharmacotherapy and nonusers (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.75, 95% CI 0.31-1.85) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-evaluation-of-patients-receiving-pharmacotherapy-for-attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The incidence of serious CV events in this cohort was 3.1 per 100,000 person-years.</p><p>In another cohort study from the United States that used two large preexisting administrative databases, there was no difference in the rate of SUD in all children between 3 and 17 years of age who received stimulant therapy (users) from control patients matched by database source, gender, age, and state (HR 1.6, 95% CI 0.19-13.60) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-evaluation-of-patients-receiving-pharmacotherapy-for-attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In addition, there was no difference in all-cause mortality between the two groups (HR 0.76, 95% CI 0.52-1.12). Although 241,417 users were identified, the HR could not be determined for predetermined events of interest because of the low or absent CV events. In the user group, there were no reported strokes or myocardial infarction, and the crude incidence rate for SUD was 0.6 per 100,000 patient-years.</p><p>In another population-based cohort study of over one million children from the United States, healthcare claims data for 28 state Medicaid programs from 1999 to 2006 showed that treatment with stimulant therapy was not associated with increased short-term risk of severe cardiac events in children between 3 and 18 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-evaluation-of-patients-receiving-pharmacotherapy-for-attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In this study, the overall rate of serious CV events (sudden cardiac death, acute myocardial infarction, or stroke) was 2.8 per 100,000 patient-years; the rate was not statistically different for children who were nonusers, current users, and former users of stimulant therapy, (3.5, 1.7, and 1.5 per 100,000 patient-years, respectively).</p><p>In contrast, a retrospective study that used national mortality data reported an association between stimulant medication and SUD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-evaluation-of-patients-receiving-pharmacotherapy-for-attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In this study, which compared the rate of stimulant use in children who died as passengers in a motor vehicle accident with those who died suddenly, the rate of stimulant medication use was higher in the SUD group compared with those in the motor vehicle accident group (1.8 versus 0.4 percent). However, the FDA concluded that this study was not able to verify a relationship between the use of stimulant therapy and SUD because of methodologic limitations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-evaluation-of-patients-receiving-pharmacotherapy-for-attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. These limitations included potential bias, as the recall of stimulant use was up to 20 years after a child's death, the possibility that medical evaluation was more thorough in children with SUD than in those who died as a result of a motor vehicle accident, the low frequency of stimulant use in both groups (as the national estimated rate is 4.3 percent), and a 40 percent parental refusal rate of participation. Because of these concerns, the FDA has stated that the results of this study should not serve as a basis to discontinue stimulant therapy in children with ADHD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Children with cardiac disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>ADHD is common in children with congenital heart disease (CHD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-evaluation-of-patients-receiving-pharmacotherapy-for-attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder/abstract/8-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-12</a>]. Limited data are available on the risks of SUD in children with CHD and concomitant ADHD who are treated with stimulant medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-evaluation-of-patients-receiving-pharmacotherapy-for-attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In one small trial of 12 children with velocardiofacial syndrome (eight with CHD), patients had no evidence of hypertension, tachycardia, or electrocardiogram (ECG) changes when they received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylphenidate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methylphenidate</a> for their ADHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-evaluation-of-patients-receiving-pharmacotherapy-for-attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In addition, there are no data to suggest that specific forms of CHD carry an increased risk of SUD in association with ADHD drugs.</p><p>The risk of cardiac events may be higher in children with other forms of pediatric cardiac disease, including long QT syndrome (LQTS). In a case-control study of 48 children with LQTS treated with ADHD medications (chiefly stimulants) and followed for approximately eight years, the rate of syncope was greater than that of age-, gender-, and QTc duration-matched patients with LQTS not taking ADHD medications (30 versus 14 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-evaluation-of-patients-receiving-pharmacotherapy-for-attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Other major cardiac events, such as cardiac arrest and LQTS death were rare, and did not differ between groups.

Multivariant analysis demonstrated a lower risk of serious CV events (defined as myocardial infarction, stroke, and sudden cardiac death) in individuals who were current users of stimulant therapy versus nonusers (relative risk [RR] 0.83, 95% CI 0.72-0.96). In new users of ADHD medications compared with controls, the risk of serious CV events was even lower (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.63-0.94). However, there may be a modest amount of healthy-user bias that favored the current users of stimulant therapy. To adjust for this potential bias, a multivariant analysis that compared current users with individuals who had used stimulant therapy more than one year ago (defined as remote use) found no difference in the risk of serious CV events (RR 1.03, 95% CI 0.86-1.24). The crude incidence of serious CV events in the overall cohort was 1.34 per 1000 person-years.</p><p>These results showing no increased risk of serious CV events are consistent with previously discussed studies in pediatric patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-evaluation-of-patients-receiving-pharmacotherapy-for-attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder/abstract/3,4,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H86661132\"><span class=\"h2\">FDA position</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In an updated safety review, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) summarized the findings of the largest cohort study in children that did <strong>not </strong>show an association between ADHD pharmacotherapy and adverse CV events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-evaluation-of-patients-receiving-pharmacotherapy-for-attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder/abstract/3,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,17</a>]. Based on these results, the FDA continues to recommend clinicians prescribe these medications according to the professional prescribing label, and that patients continue to use prescribed therapy for the treatment of ADHD. Patients should be monitored for changes in heart rate and blood pressure. Stimulant therapy generally should not be prescribed in patients with serious heart problems or in whom an increase in blood pressure or heart rate would be problematic. In these individuals, if ADHD therapy is deemed necessary, it should be managed in consultation with a cardiologist.

All other complaints were one-time isolated reports that were judged to be mild or moderate in severity.

However, it is important to note that the available evidence does not suggest a causal association between CV risk and stimulant use. Furthermore, there are no specific cardiac conditions for which there is definitive evidence that the use of ADHD medications should be contraindicated. What is clear, however, is limiting or delaying children's access to effective treatment for ADHD could have serious implications (such as increased risk of adolescent substance use disorder, academic failure, and accidents) in patients who are not effectively treated.

These results suggest that ECG is not a cost-effective screen to detect cardiac disease in children with ADHD.</p><p>A modeled economic evaluation studied various strategies of identifying children receiving ADHD therapy at risk for sudden cardiac death and concluded that there may be a borderline cost-effectiveness of screening with an ECG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-evaluation-of-patients-receiving-pharmacotherapy-for-attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. An accompanying editorial, as well as the authors, however, point out that some of the assumptions used to develop the model are not well established or may vary greatly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-evaluation-of-patients-receiving-pharmacotherapy-for-attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10775178\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During treatment with ADHD stimulant therapy, the patient should be assessed for any changes in CV symptoms (eg, fainting or dizziness, seizures, chest pain or shortness of breath with exercise, unexplained change in exercise tolerance, or palpitations). Evaluation should include measurement of heart rate and blood pressure to ascertain whether there have been any significant changes in these signs, especially if the blood pressure reaches either prehypertension or hypertension levels. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-and-diagnosis-of-hypertension-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition and diagnosis of hypertension in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In patients with concerning symptoms or findings, consultation with a pediatric cardiologist should be considered.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a common childhood disorder affecting up to 8 to 10 percent of all school-aged children. Stimulant drugs are effective in improving behavior in these patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents: Epidemiology and pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-treatment-with-medications#H2007898700\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents: Treatment with medications&quot;, section on 'Stimulants versus other medications'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although there had been concerns of serious adverse cardiac effects, stimulant therapy does not appear to increase the risk of sudden unexpected cardiac death or other serious cardiac complications (eg, myocardial infarction or stroke) in patients without underlying cardiac disease. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Risk of sudden unexpected deaths'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stimulant medications are known to have modest cardiovascular effects including small elevations in heart rate (3 to 10 beats per minute), systolic blood pressure (3 to 8 mmHg), and diastolic blood pressure (2 to 14 mmHg). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Known cardiac effects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Based upon the available evidence, we agree with the approach outlined by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American Heart Association (AHA) for a careful pretreatment evaluation including a comprehensive cardiovascular-focused patient history, family history, and physical examination. If the history and examination are not suggestive of cardiac disease, pharmacotherapy can be initiated or continued without additional evaluation. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Cardiac evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An electrocardiogram (ECG) is <strong>not</strong> required before initiating stimulant therapy for patients with ADHD. However, if the patient is known to have cardiac disease, or if the history or physical examination is suggestive of cardiac disease, further evaluation including ECG <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> consultation with a pediatric or adult cardiologist is needed. (See <a href=\"#H906344359\" class=\"local\">'Additional evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The potential risks of stimulants should be discussed with the family when deciding upon the management strategy for any patient with ADHD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-in-children-and-adolescents-treatment-with-medications#H2007898700\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder in children and adolescents: Treatment with medications&quot;, section on 'Stimulants versus other medications'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children who are prescribed ADHD stimulant therapy should be routinely evaluated for any changes in heart rate or blood pressure, as well as cardiovascular symptoms during treatment.
