Some people who have a stroke have no lasting effects. Others lose important brain functions. For example, some people become partly paralyzed or can't speak.</p><p>Here are some of the most common long-term problems that can be caused by a stroke:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Speech problems</strong> &ndash; People who have a stroke sometimes can't speak anymore or can't understand speech. The medical term for this is &quot;aphasia.&quot; Some people might still be able to speak but have slurred speech. The medical term for this is &quot;dysarthria.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Weakness and movement problems</strong> &ndash; People who have a stroke sometimes have muscle weakness or paralysis of the left or right side of the body. The muscle weakness can affect the face, arm, and leg. The medical term for this is &quot;hemiparesis.&quot; People who have a stroke can also have trouble walking, grasping objects, or balancing. Plus, they might not be able to make controlled, planned movements, even if the stroke did not cause weakness or loss of sensation. The medical term for not being able to make planned, controlled movements is &quot;apraxia.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Partial loss of sensation</strong> &ndash; People who have a stroke sometimes have partial or total loss of feeling on the left or right half of their body.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Trouble eating or swallowing</strong> &ndash; People who have a stroke sometimes have trouble swallowing. The medical term for this is &quot;dysphagia.&quot; Sometimes this problem causes food to go down the wrong way and into the lungs. This can be dangerous because it can lead to lung infections, such as pneumonia. Some people need a feeding tube to deal with this problem. Others can adapt by changing the foods and liquids they eat and drink.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Problems thinking clearly or interacting with others</strong> &ndash; People who have a stroke sometimes get confused easily or have trouble staying focused. They can also have personality changes that make them react differently to others.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Depression</strong> &ndash; People who have a stroke also sometimes get depressed. This can make recovery even harder. It's important to get treated for depression after a stroke.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Problems with bladder control</strong> &ndash; People who have a stroke sometimes can't control their bladder or leak urine. The medical term for this is &quot;urinary incontinence.&quot; It often gets better over time.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6591102\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens during recovery from a stroke?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During recovery, people work to regain some of the abilities they lost. Even though a part of their brain was damaged by the stroke, their brain can re-learn how to do some of the things it used to do.</p><p>People who can't speak after a stroke can often re-learn how to speak or at least how to communicate to some degree. In the same way, people who can't walk can sometimes re-learn how to walk. (Some people need to use canes or other devices to walk.)</p><p>Recovery often involves treatment in a stroke &quot;rehabilitation&quot; facility, also called stroke &quot;rehab.&quot; In rehab, there are all kinds of medical professionals who specialize in helping people who have had a stroke. If you go to stroke rehab, the people there can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Help you regain some of the abilities you lost</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Give you tips on how to cope with the problems caused by the stroke</p><p/><p>Here are just a few examples of how a rehab specialist could help you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you can no longer walk very well, <strong>a physical therapist</strong> (exercise expert) can show you ways to improve the way you walk. He or she can also recommend braces, canes, and other devices that might make it easier for you to walk.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you can no longer swallow well, <strong>a speech and language therapist</strong> can teach you to do exercises that might improve how you swallow. He or she can also offer tips on how to cope with swallowing problems. For instance, the therapist might suggest you add powders or other ingredients to the liquids you drink, so that they are thick and less likely to go down the wrong way.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you can no longer hold your toothbrush to brush your teeth, <strong>an occupational therapist</strong> can show you new ways of holding your brush, so that you can use it.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you are depressed because you had a stroke, <strong>a psychiatrist</strong> (doctor who specializes in mental health) can prescribe medicines to treat depression. He or she can also talk to you about the way you feel about the stroke.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6591117\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the chances of full recovery after a stroke?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The chances of making a full recovery depend on a lot of factors, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How big the stroke was</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What part of the brain was damaged by the stroke</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How old the person is (younger people tend to recover better than older people)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What other medical problems the person has (such as heart failure or cancer)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether the person was sick before the stroke happened</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How soon the person was treated following the stroke</p><p/><p>Scientists used to think that when a part of the brain was damaged, there was no way to recover what was lost. It turns out that is not true. The brain can adapt and recover some function. The most important thing you can do to help make this happen is to stick with rehab and do all the exercises and therapies your healthcare team recommends. Also, be patient. It takes time to heal and learn new ways to cope, but work and patience can pay off.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6591132\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=stroke-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Stroke (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=aphasia-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Aphasia (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dysarthria-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Dysarthria (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lowering-the-risk-of-having-another-stroke-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Lowering the risk of having another stroke (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medicines-after-an-ischemic-stroke-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medicines after an ischemic stroke (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemorrhagic-stroke-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hemorrhagic stroke (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=transient-ischemic-attack-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Transient ischemic attack (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=carotid-artery-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Carotid artery disease (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-blood-pressure-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: High blood pressure in adults (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=stroke-symptoms-and-diagnosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Stroke symptoms and diagnosis (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ischemic-stroke-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Ischemic stroke treatment (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemorrhagic-stroke-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Hemorrhagic stroke treatment (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
