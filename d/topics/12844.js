Bowel obstruction caused by cancer is referred to as malignant bowel obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-bowel-obstruction-in-cancer-patients/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In everyday practice, however, it is often difficult to differentiate malignant from benign bowel obstruction, as cancer patients, especially those who have a history of abdominal surgery, can develop bowel obstruction from benign etiologies (eg, adhesions). Regardless of etiology, management of bowel obstruction in patients with advanced stage cancer can be difficult; a decision to proceed to surgical intervention requires careful weighing of risks and benefits, including an assessment of the estimated life expectancy and the patient&rsquo;s goals and preferences for care. </p><p>In this topic, we discuss the etiologies, clinical features, diagnostic evaluation, and management of bowel obstruction in cancer patients. General discussions of small and large obstruction can be found in other topics.

It is most prevalent in ovarian cancer (5.5 to 42 percent), colorectal cancer (4.4 to 24 percent), and gastric cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-bowel-obstruction-in-cancer-patients/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Uncommonly, metastases from extraabdominal cancers, including breast cancer, lung cancer, and melanoma, can also cause malignant bowel obstruction. Malignant bowel obstruction presents most frequently in advanced stage cancer patients. In a large cohort study of 490 cancer patients from MD Anderson, the anatomic sites of obstruction were classified as gastric outlet, small bowel, and large bowel in 16, 64, and 20 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-bowel-obstruction-in-cancer-patients/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3096419954\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intestinal obstruction may be caused by benign or malignant etiologies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F113422\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113422 \">table 1</a>). Distinguishing benign causes from malignant bowel obstruction in a cancer patient can be challenging but has profound impacts upon management decisions and prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-bowel-obstruction-in-cancer-patients/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Among cancer patients, large bowel obstruction is four to five times less frequent than small bowel obstruction, and the causes differ substantially [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-bowel-obstruction-in-cancer-patients/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Most small bowel obstructions are due to benign causes, whereas malignant causes predominate in large bowel obstructions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4080839232\"><span class=\"h2\">Benign etiologies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bowel obstruction can be caused by nonmalignant causes, including postsurgical adhesions, radiation enteritis, or other infectious or inflammatory gastrointestinal diseases (eg, abscess, phlegmon) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F113422\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113422 \">table 1</a>). Benign conditions are more commonly observed when the obstruction is in the small bowel, where primary tumors are rare.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3848265986\"><span class=\"h3\">Postsurgical adhesion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among cancer patients with small bowel obstructions, adhesions are the main cause in 50 to 80 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-bowel-obstruction-in-cancer-patients/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. Almost all adhesions are postoperative, with a minority being secondary to peritonitis or other causes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-bowel-obstruction-in-cancer-patients/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

Radiation therapy can also cause serositis, which can lead to luminal narrowing and bowel dysmotility. The ileal loops in the pelvis are most susceptible to developing radiation enteritis.

In contrast to small bowel obstruction, malignant etiologies predominate in large bowel obstruction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4164867628\"><span class=\"h3\">Intraluminal obstruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An obstructing intraluminal lesion, most commonly a colorectal malignancy, is the most common cause of large bowel obstruction (&gt;60 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-bowel-obstruction-in-cancer-patients/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

Peritoneal deposits or tumor masses may cause external compression of loops of small bowel. Additionally, pericancer inflammation can lead to adhesions. Mesenteric and omental tumor involvement may angulate the bowel and provoke an extramural bowel occlusion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2429617887\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms of intestinal obstruction typically include crampy, paroxysmal abdominal pain, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, inability to have a bowel movement or pass flatus, and abdominal bloating. Physical findings include a distended, tender abdomen with or without a palpable mass. The patterns of clinical presentation are further determined by the level of obstruction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F113423\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113423 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3652854583\"><span class=\"h2\">Proximal bowel obstruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with an obstruction at the level of the stomach or proximal small bowel typically have abrupt onset of abdominal pain and <span class=\"nowrap\">nausea/vomiting</span> in large volumes, with nausea temporarily relieved after each episode of vomiting. The loss of gastric secretions due to repeated vomiting may lead to metabolic alkalosis and hypokalemia. Abdominal distension may be absent in proximal obstruction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults#H413451751\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of mechanical small bowel obstruction in adults&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4229002700\"><span class=\"h2\">Distal bowel obstruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with an obstruction at the level of the distal small bowel, colon, or rectum often have insidious and progressive onset of symptoms, including abdominal pain, constipation or obstipation, and abdominal distension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-bowel-obstruction-in-cancer-patients/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Abdominal distention is more pronounced than that typically seen with proximal bowel obstruction. Bowel sounds are usually hypoactive in patients with distal bowel obstruction due to the cessation of peristalsis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-mechanical-colorectal-obstruction#H194983524\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of mechanical colorectal obstruction&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentations'</a>.)</p><p>The clinical features of malignant and benign bowel obstructions may be indistinguishable without imaging studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-bowel-obstruction-in-cancer-patients/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2273273666\" class=\"local\">'Radiographic studies'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1696499114\"><span class=\"h2\">Natural history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to being caused by benign or malignant etiologies, intestinal obstruction in cancer patients may be partial or complete, acute or chronic, reversible (especially when caused by postsurgical adhesions) or irreversible, and single or multiple, and they may occur at any level of the gastrointestinal tract. </p><p>Intestinal obstruction may progress rapidly, causing serious, life-threatening complications such as intestinal ischemia, infarction, and perforation, or peritonitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-management-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults#H372577787\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of management of mechanical small bowel obstruction in adults&quot;, section on 'Indications for surgical exploration'</a>.)</p><p>More frequently, however, the progression of bowel obstruction is slow and insidious. With a partial obstruction, the intestine goes through cycles of luminal distension and secretion, leading to local inflammation and luminal accumulation of fluid, gas, and solid waste. As the obstruction progresses from partial to complete, symptoms gradually shift from nausea and colicky pain with occasional vomiting to less colicky pain but greater gastrointestinal symptoms and abdominal distention. If left untreated, bowel obstruction will eventually lead to intestinal ischemia, when patients present with severe abdominal pain and tenderness.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3045471394\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with known or suspected cancer who present with signs and symptoms that are consistent with a bowel obstruction, a diagnostic workup should be performed not only to establish the diagnosis and the level of obstruction, but also to assess tumor burden, which may influence the goals of care. Depending upon the extent of cancer spread, many patients will not be candidates for aggressive (surgical) treatment of their bowel obstruction. (See <a href=\"#H284706046\" class=\"local\">'Surgical candidates'</a> below.)</p><p>A diagnostic workup for suspected bowel obstruction typically consists of one or more radiographic studies and laboratory evaluation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2273273666\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiographic studies</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2462844445\"><span class=\"h3\">Plain abdominal radiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plain abdominal radiography is the initial study of choice due to its wide availability and low cost. Plain abdominal films (supine and nondependent [either upright or left lateral decubitus to detect pneumoperitoneum]) have a high sensitivity for diagnosing high-grade small bowel obstructions, which are characterized by the presence of bowel distention and at least two air fluid levels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F88524\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef88524 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-bowel-obstruction-in-cancer-patients/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Low-grade small bowel obstruction is more accurately diagnosed by computed tomography (CT). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults#H2972181\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of mechanical small bowel obstruction in adults&quot;, section on 'Plain radiography'</a>.)</p><p>Supine and nondependent abdominal films are also helpful in patients suspected of having a large bowel obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-bowel-obstruction-in-cancer-patients/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In such patients, plain abdominal radiography can diagnose a large bowel obstruction while excluding a small bowel obstruction or a pneumoperitoneum. Large bowel obstruction is characterized by dilated colon proximal and no air distal to the site of obstruction. Additionally, air-fluid levels are often visible in the dilated colon on the upright or decubitus radiographs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-bowel-obstruction-in-cancer-patients/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The presence of air-fluid levels suggests a more acute obstruction with which the fluid in the colon has not been absorbed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-mechanical-colorectal-obstruction#H76779239\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of mechanical colorectal obstruction&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Complications of large bowel obstruction can sometimes be diagnosed using plain abdominal radiography (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F83043\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef83043 \">image 2</a>). Pneumoperitoneum (ie, &ldquo;free air&rdquo;) indicates perforated viscus, for which urgent surgical exploration is mandated. The presence of intramural gas (ie, pneumatosis intestinalis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F72081\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef72081 \">image 3</a>)) is a sign of bowel necrosis and impending perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-bowel-obstruction-in-cancer-patients/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Toxic megacolon, a complication that can occur with several diseases of the colon, such as infections, ischemia, and inflammation, is characterized by its hallmark features of marked bowel wall thickening, loss of haustration, and segmental colonic parietal wall thinning (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F59217\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef59217 \">image 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-bowel-obstruction-in-cancer-patients/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumatosis-intestinalis#H2299869411\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pneumatosis intestinalis&quot;, section on 'Evaluation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=toxic-megacolon#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Toxic megacolon&quot;, section on 'Radiography'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H516814592\"><span class=\"h3\">Abdominopelvic computed tomography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abdominopelvic CT is commonly used to diagnose clinically suspected bowel obstructions. Compared with plain abdominal radiography, contrast-enhanced helical multidetector row CT with multiplanar reconstructions can provide more clinically relevant information, which may lead to changes in management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-bowel-obstruction-in-cancer-patients/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. CT can determine if bowel obstruction is present, localize the obstructive site and the degree of obstruction, diagnose the presence of closed-loop obstruction, and identify ischemia or perforation of the involved bowel (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F87586\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef87586 \">image 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F53816\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef53816 \">image 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F56792\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef56792 \">image 7</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F58309\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef58309 \">image 8</a>). Owing to its ability to demonstrate strangulation, CT is considered the best modality for determining which patients would benefit from immediate surgical intervention versus conservative management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-bowel-obstruction-in-cancer-patients/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Furthermore, in patients with malignant bowel obstruction, CT can also detect local and regional metastases.</p><p>Primary cancer is rare in the small bowel. Most intraluminal causes of small bowel obstruction manifest as an endoluminal mass with imaging characteristics that are distinct from those of the remaining enteric content (ie, stool) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-bowel-obstruction-in-cancer-patients/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. When a primary small bowel cancer manifests as an obstruction, it usually occurs in an advanced stage of disease and is characterized by a pronounced, asymmetric, and irregular mural thickening at the transition point. Small bowel involvement by metastatic cancer is more commonly seen in the form of peritoneal carcinomatosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-bowel-obstruction-in-cancer-patients/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-staging-of-small-bowel-neoplasms#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and staging of small bowel neoplasms&quot;, section on 'CT scan'</a>.)</p><p>In radiation enteritis, CT findings may include a narrowing of the lumen secondary to mural thickening, an angular bowel wall due to adhesions, and retraction of the mesentery. There may also be abnormal enhancement of a segment of thickened bowel wall if that segment was present within the radiation field [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-bowel-obstruction-in-cancer-patients/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-management-of-chronic-radiation-enteritis#H650632424\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and management of chronic radiation enteritis&quot;, section on 'Imaging'</a>.)</p><p>Small bowel obstruction due to adhesions is characterized by the presence of dilated small bowel loops proximally and normal-caliber or collapsed loops distally. It is primarily a diagnosis of exclusion because adhesive bands are not typically visible on conventional CT. However, it is possible to see an abrupt change in the caliber of the bowel without any associated mass lesions, significant inflammation, or bowel wall thickening at the transition point (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F87585\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef87585 \">image 9</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F50457\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef50457 \">image 10</a>). A history of abdominal surgery, the kinking and tethering of the adjacent nonobstructed bowel loops, and the absence of a mass lesion either within or outside of the bowel may support the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults#H2972188\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of mechanical small bowel obstruction in adults&quot;, section on 'Abdominal CT'</a>.)</p><p>It is preferable to give oral as well as intravenous contrast, as this will allow the grade of small bowel obstruction to be determined by CT imaging. A low-grade partial small bowel obstruction is characterized by flow of contrast material through the point of obstruction. On the other hand, the partial small bowel obstruction is characterized as high-grade when there is some stasis and delay in the passage of the contrast so that diluted oral contrast material appears in the distended proximal bowel and minimal contrast material appears in the collapsed distal loops. Finally, a complete obstruction is diagnosed when there is no passage of contrast medium beyond the point of obstruction, even on delayed repeat scans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-bowel-obstruction-in-cancer-patients/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p>Large bowel obstruction is characterized by dilated large bowel proximal to a transition point and decompressed bowel distal to the obstruction. The presence of a transition point is considered a reliable finding for the diagnosis of large bowel obstruction on CT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-bowel-obstruction-in-cancer-patients/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-mechanical-colorectal-obstruction#H76779239\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of mechanical colorectal obstruction&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p><strong>Abdominopelvic magnetic resonance imaging</strong> &ndash; Although it is rarely used as the first-line imaging modality, abdominopelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used to diagnose bowel obstruction in select patients. Abdominopelvic MRI has the advantage of being better able than CT to detect and characterize peritoneal and hepatic disease. However, CT scans can be performed more quickly, and the equipment is typically more readily available</p><p>In one study, benign and malignant bowel obstruction were distinguishable by their MRI characteristics after administration of gadolinium contrast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-bowel-obstruction-in-cancer-patients/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Bowel obstruction due to benign causes (most often adhesions) showed mild peritoneal enhancement and mesenteric infiltration, often with segmental or diffuse mural thickening without an obstructing mass. By contrast, malignant obstructions (most often due to carcinomatosis) produced moderate or bulky peritoneal thickening and tumor masses, often with focal or segmental mural thickening, serosal metastases, and disseminated abdominal tumor. Segmental mural thickening can occur in either benign or malignant bowel obstruction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1939489509\"><span class=\"h3\">Abdominal ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abdominal ultrasound is of limited value in diagnosing bowel obstruction due to interference from gas-filled bowel loops. Adhesions, the most common cause of mechanical small bowel obstruction, are not detected with this technique. However, when the obstructed bowel segments are dilated and filled with fluid, it is possible to detect the level of obstruction and the cause of the obstruction by using the fluid-filled bowel as a sonic window [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-bowel-obstruction-in-cancer-patients/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2541155505\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with suspected or confirmed bowel obstruction, laboratory studies should be performed to evaluate for the presence of metabolic derangements (eg, acidosis, electrolyte abnormality, renal injury) and leukocytosis. Severe abnormalities (extreme leucocytosis, metabolic or lactic acidosis) may suggest bowel ischemia, albeit with a low specificity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-bowel-obstruction-in-cancer-patients/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>A role for circulating tumor markers in the distinction between benign and malignant causes of bowel obstruction is not established. However, for patients in whom there has been a correlation between levels of a serum tumor marker (eg, carcinoembryonic antigen [CEA] for colorectal cancer, cancer antigen 125 [CA-125] for ovarian cancer) and their disease burden, assay of that specific tumor marker may help to clarify the tumor burden.

The process is commonly referred to as paralytic or adynamic ileus when it is acute or self-limited, and as intestinal pseudo-obstruction when it is chronic or recurrent. Ileus or pseudo-obstruction can be caused by recent abdominal or pelvic surgery, intraabdominal infections (eg, gastroenteritis or appendicitis), medications (eg, opioids, antidepressants, or antimuscarinics), metabolic disturbances (eg, hypokalemia), and peritoneal carcinomatosis without extrinsic bowel compression (by involving the autonomic nerves that innervate the intestine). Intestinal pseudo-obstruction is most frequently caused by neuromuscular disorders such as Parkinson disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postoperative-ileus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postoperative ileus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-intestinal-pseudo-obstruction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Bowel obstruction and <span class=\"nowrap\">ileus/pseudo-obstruction</span> can be distinguished by radiographic studies.

Also, colonic dilation due to paralytic ileus or colonic pseudo-obstruction usually occurs with minimal colonic fluid. Hence, the presence of air-fluid levels should raise the suspicion of an obstruction. Nevertheless, the differentiation between large bowel obstruction and pseudo-obstruction remains difficult, and computed tomography (CT) may be needed to affirm the diagnosis.

Uncommonly, metastases from extraabdominal cancers, including breast cancer, lung cancer, and melanoma, can also cause malignant bowel obstruction. (See <a href=\"#H1219170594\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intestinal obstruction in patients with cancer may be caused by benign or malignant etiologies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F113422\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113422 \">table 1</a>). Distinguishing benign from malignant bowel obstruction in a cancer patient can be challenging but has profound impacts upon management decisions and prognosis. Among cancer patients, large bowel obstruction is four to five times less frequent than small bowel obstruction, and the causes differ substantially. Most small bowel obstructions are due to benign causes (most often postsurgical adhesions), whereas malignant causes predominate in large bowel obstructions. (See <a href=\"#H3096419954\" class=\"local\">'Etiology and pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition to postsurgical adhesions, the differential diagnosis of a malignant bowel obstruction includes radiation enteritis and nonobstructive intestinal disorders such as ileus, intestinal pseudo-obstruction, and severe constipation. (See <a href=\"#H946730896\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnoses'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms of intestinal obstruction typically include crampy, paroxysmal abdominal pain, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, inability to have a bowel movement or pass flatus, and abdominal bloating. Physical findings include a distended, tender abdomen with or without a palpable mass. The patterns of clinical presentation are further determined by the level of obstruction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F113423\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113423 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2429617887\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with known or suspected cancer who present with signs and symptoms that are consistent with a bowel obstruction, a diagnostic workup should be performed to establish the diagnosis and the level of obstruction, and to assess tumor burden, which may influence the goals of care. (See <a href=\"#H3045471394\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Plain abdominal radiography (supine and nondependent [either upright or left lateral decubitus to detect pneumoperitoneum]) is the initial radiographic study of choice due to its wide availability and low cost. Contrast-enhanced helical multidetector row computed tomography (CT) scan provides more clinically relevant information, which may lead to changes in management.

The remainder should be initially managed nonoperatively with nasogastric decompression of the <span class=\"nowrap\">stomach/intestine</span> and intravenous fluids. Patients whose symptoms have not been relieved with 48 to 72 hours of nonoperative management require definitive surgical intervention if they are deemed suitable surgical candidates. (See <a href=\"#H3764620909\" class=\"local\">'Initial management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In general, patients should be considered potential surgical candidates unless they are critically ill, have a poor performance status (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F57945\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57945 \">table 3</a>), or refuse surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-of-bowel-obstruction-in-cancer-patients/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. After a thorough surgical evaluation, patients who are potential surgical candidates may be deemed unlikely to benefit from surgery for anatomic or clinical reasons.

However, management must be individualized based upon the risks and potential benefits of surgery, the patient&rsquo;s clinical condition, cancer stage and estimated life expectancy, performance status, and comorbidities, and their preferences, wishes, and goals of therapy. (See <a href=\"#H284706046\" class=\"local\">'Surgical candidates'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients who are deemed surgical candidates, the choice of surgical technique depends on each patient&rsquo;s anatomy, comorbidities, risk factors, and cancer prognosis. In general, the surgical technique that will produce the most durable relief of symptoms with a reasonable operative morbidity should be used. Surgical techniques commonly performed to relieve bowel obstruction include bowel resection, bypass, diversion, stenting, and lysis of adhesions. (See <a href=\"#H1739895872\" class=\"local\">'Surgical techniques'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Options for patients with inoperable intestinal obstruction or who are not candidates for surgery include placement of a self-expanding colorectal stent, decompression using an endoscopically placed gastrostomy tube, and medical management with antiemetics, somatostatin analogs, glucocorticoids, and anticholinergic agents.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Indications for stent placement in patients with malignant colonic obstruction include (see <a href=\"#H3103216299\" class=\"local\">'Self-expanding stents for malignant colorectal obstruction'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Palliation of surgically incurable colorectal cancer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Stenting as a bridge to surgery to avoid an emergent two-step procedure and to allow for optimization of medical status and for preoperative staging including colonoscopy. (See <a href=\"#H2850365729\" class=\"local\">'Colostomy or colonic stenting as a bridge to surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Management of some patients with extracolonic pelvic tumors (eg, ovarian cancer) that are causing extrinsic compression.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Decompression of gastric contents can be achieved through placement of a percutaneous gastrostomy tube. However, pharmacologic management is generally preferred for most patients. Enteral tube drainage may be recommended if pharmacologic management is unsuccessful. (See <a href=\"#H2922136350\" class=\"local\">'Endoscopic gastrostomy tube'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">All patients with inoperable malignant bowel obstruction who are not candidates for a stent should undergo treatment with antisecretory drugs. For most patients, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=octreotide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">octreotide</a> rather than an anticholinergic agent (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). The usual starting dose is 0.1 mg (100 micrograms) twice daily given subcutaneously. Rapid dose titration may be needed, and doses several times the starting dose, and sometimes significantly higher, are needed by some patients. Patients who respond can be given a depot injection of long-acting octreotide (Sandostatin LAR) monthly for maintenance therapy. (See <a href=\"#H1883285412\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although published randomized controlled trials for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in palliative care patients with malignant bowel obstruction are lacking, intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=haloperidol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">haloperidol</a> is considered a first-choice antiemetic in this setting. Prokinetic agents should be avoided if there is complete mechanical obstruction or colicky abdominal pain. We reserve the use of glucocorticoids for patients who do not respond to antisecretory therapy with an antiemetic. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is little, if any, justification for the use of parenteral nutritional support in patients with advanced cancer who are terminally ill and who have an estimated life span that is measured in weeks to a few months, and we recommend against its use for most patients (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4230391935\" class=\"local\">'Role of nutritional support'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Mercadante S.
