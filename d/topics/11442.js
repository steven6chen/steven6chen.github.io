The term myopericarditis, or perimyocarditis, is used for cases of acute pericarditis that also demonstrate myocardial inflammation. Acute pericarditis and myocarditis often occur together, although they are rarely of equivalent intensity. When both are present, they generally give rise to clinical syndromes that are mainly pericarditic or myocarditic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myopericarditis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The clinical presentation, diagnostic evaluation, and treatment for myopericarditis will be reviewed here.

On the other hand, the term perimyocarditis indicates a primarily myocarditic syndrome. However, these two terms are often used interchangeably without regard to the predominant type of cardiac involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myopericarditis/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].

Viral-induced myocyte damage may lead to the release of intracellular proteins that trigger immunopathic responses in the presence of a predisposing genetic background. This mechanism may cause ongoing post-viral myopericardial damage even in the absence of residual viral genome. Similar mechanisms may play a role in other causes of myopericarditis, such as connective tissue diseases, inflammatory bowel disease, and radiation-induced and drug-induced disease.</p><p>Myopericarditis is not uncommon in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases and among those exposed to radiation or certain drugs. Bacterial and other non-viral infections appear to be rare causes of myopericardial disease, although myopericarditis has been reported in up to 50 percent of patients with tuberculous pericarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myopericarditis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

While many cases of myopericarditis are subclinical, in other patients, cardiac symptoms and signs are overshadowed by systemic manifestations of infection or inflammation, such as fever, myalgias, and gastrointestinal symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4339851\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among patients who are symptomatic, the manifestations may include those associated with pericarditis, myocarditis, or a combination of the two (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F74376\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74376 \">table 3</a>). Patients with an infectious etiology may present with signs and symptoms of systemic infection such as fever and leukocytosis. Viral etiologies in particular may be preceded by &quot;flu-like&quot; respiratory or gastrointestinal symptoms. Patients with a known autoimmune disorder or malignancy may present with signs or symptoms specific to their underlying disorder.</p><p>Besides the systemic symptoms, patients with primarily pericarditis-type symptoms usually experience positional or pleuritic chest pain with or without fatigue, decreased exercise capacity, dyspnea, or palpitations. Pericarditis-like chest pain is typically fairly sudden in onset, occurs over the anterior chest, and, unlike pain from myocardial ischemia, chest pain due to pericarditis is most often sharp and pleuritic in nature, with exacerbation by inspiration or coughing. However, chest pain can occasionally be difficult to distinguish from ischemic pain, particularly since signs of myocardial involvement can simulate an acute coronary syndrome as reported in acute myocarditis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-pericarditis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute pericarditis: Clinical presentation and diagnostic evaluation&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p>In patients with primarily myocarditis-like symptoms, the variable clinical presentation reflects how focally or diffusely the myocardium is involved and which cardiac chambers are involved. Heart failure symptoms may predominate, although patients with myocarditis-like symptoms may also experience chest pain. Rarely, patients may present with arrhythmias resulting in palpitations, syncope, or sudden cardiac death. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-myocarditis-in-adults#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of myocarditis in adults&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>The manifestations of acute pericarditis and myocarditis are discussed in greater detail separately.

The majority of patients with myopericarditis will have a normal or near normal physical examination. Those with significant systemic symptoms of inflammation may presents with a fever. In patients with symptoms suggestive of pericardial involvement, a pericardial friction rub may be present, while those with myocardial involvement may present with signs of heart failure and volume overload (eg, hypoxia, pulmonary congestion, elevated jugular venous pulsations, peripheral edema). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-pericarditis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute pericarditis: Clinical presentation and diagnostic evaluation&quot;, section on 'Pericardial friction rub'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-patient-with-suspected-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the patient with suspected heart failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Electrocardiogram findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Changes on the surface electrocardiogram (ECG) are common in myopericarditis; these changes reflect some degree of epicardial or myocardial involvement since the parietal pericardium is electrically silent.</p><p>A typical pattern of ECG evolution commonly occurs in both myopericarditis and acute pericarditis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F79140\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef79140 \">waveform 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F77572\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef77572 \">waveform 2</a>). This pattern includes diffuse ST elevation and PR depression, followed by normalization of ST and PR segments, and then diffuse T wave inversions.

Mild increases in serum cTnI often occur in the absence of elevations in CK-MB.

CMR imaging is helpful for identifying and characterizing pericardial and myocardial disease. In particular, CMR imaging can noninvasively assess for myocardial inflammatory involvement and rule out a pattern of myocardial infarction (MI) necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myopericarditis/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. In selected patients with coronary risk factors or when differentiation from MI is needed, coronary angiography may be required to rule out obstructive coronary artery disease and an acute coronary syndrome.

Myopericarditis should also be suspected in a patient with abnormal ECG findings and arrhythmias (especially ventricular). Additional testing, which typically includes blood work, chest radiography, electrocardiography, and echocardiography, can support the diagnosis but may be unrevealing or nonspecific. The electrocardiogram and serum cardiac troponin levels are usually the most helpful tests in the evaluation of patients with suspected myopericarditis. Echocardiography is often normal, but can be an essential part of the evaluation if there is evidence of an associated pericardial effusion <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> evidence of left ventricular dysfunction (regional or global). </p><p>Cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is mandatory to have a non-invasive confirmation of the clinical diagnosis, while endomyocardial biopsy is helpful for confirming the diagnosis in selected patients (eg, arrhythmias, heart failure or left ventricular dysfunction not improving on conventional medical therapy) since a specific tissue diagnosis would alter therapy (eg, giant cell myocarditis). The 2015 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines on the diagnosis and management of pericarditis are consistent with this approach and gave a Class I recommendation for the use of CMR to confirm the diagnosis of myocardial involvement in the setting of pericarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myopericarditis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1518265\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For a patient who presents with suspected myopericarditis, it is our practice to proceed with the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial history and physical examination with particular focus upon symptoms or signs of pericarditis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> myocarditis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial testing in all patients should include: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Electrocardiogram (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Electrocardiogram findings'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Chest x-ray (see <a href=\"#H1518057\" class=\"local\">'Chest radiography'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Complete blood count, troponin level, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and serum C-reactive protein level (see <a href=\"#H1517891\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory studies'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Blood cultures if fever higher than 38&ordm;C (100.4&ordm;F) or signs of sepsis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Echocardiography (see <a href=\"#H1518152\" class=\"local\">'Echocardiography'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Additional testing in selected patients may include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging for evaluation of both the myocardium and pericardium</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Coronary angiography to exclude obstructive coronary heart disease and an acute coronary syndrome as the cause of symptoms and troponin elevation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Endomyocardial biopsy for histologic evaluation if the diagnosis remains in doubt (see <a href=\"#H1518192\" class=\"local\">'Endomyocardial biopsy'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute pericarditis is diagnosed by the presence of two or more of the following features: chest pain, pericardial friction rub, ECG changes (diffuse ST segment elevation or PR depression), and pericardial effusion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F74376\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74376 \">table 3</a>).

On the other hand, the term perimyocarditis indicates a primarily myocarditic syndrome. However, these two terms are often used interchangeably without regard to the predominant type of cardiac involvement, with myopericarditis generally being the preferred term. (See <a href=\"#H18607882\" class=\"local\">'Definition'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute pericarditis and myocarditis share similar etiologic agents (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56995\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56995 \">table 2</a>). Limited clinical data on the causes of myopericarditis suggest that viral infections are among the most common causes in developed countries. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical presentation of myopericarditis reflects the degree of myopericardial involvement, which may be focal or diffuse. While many cases of myopericarditis are subclinical, the manifestations include those associated with pericarditis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> myocarditis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F74376\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74376 \">table 3</a>), including positional or pleuritic chest pain, fatigue, dyspnea, edema, palpitations, fever, or myalgias.

Additional testing should include cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging to confirm concomitant myocardial inflammatory involvement, with coronary angiography reserved for select patients if there is uncertainty as to whether the symptoms and troponin elevation reflect an acute coronary syndrome rather than myopericarditis.

Myopericarditis should also be suspected in a patient with persistent fever and pericardial effusion or new unexplained cardiomegaly, particularly with ECG changes suggestive of pericardial involvement and elevated cardiac biomarkers.
