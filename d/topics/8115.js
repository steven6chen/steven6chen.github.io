They are seen predominantly in young women (20 to 44 years old), are frequently located in the right hepatic lobe, and are typically solitary (70 to 80 percent), although multiple adenomas have been described in patients with prolonged contraceptive use, glycogen storage diseases, and hepatic adenomatosis. Adenomas range in size from 1 to 30 cm. Symptoms such as abdominal pain are more likely with larger lesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F58773\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58773 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-adenoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The prognosis of hepatic adenomas is not well established. However, they have been associated with malignant transformation, spontaneous hemorrhage, and rupture. As a result, their distinction from other types of benign liver tumors is important. This can most often be accomplished using a combination of imaging techniques, although rarely a definitive diagnosis may only be achieved following resection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=solid-liver-lesions-differential-diagnosis-and-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Solid liver lesions: Differential diagnosis and evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY AND INCIDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hepatic adenomas are strongly associated with use of oral contraceptives, anabolic androgens, and glycogen storage disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-adenoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. They are less commonly associated with pregnancy and diabetes mellitus.</p><p>The incidence of hepatic adenomas has increased in the last several decades, a trend that coincided with the introduction of oral contraceptives (OCPs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-adenoma/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. In addition, adenomas are increasingly encountered as incidental findings in patients undergoing ultrasound, computed tomography, or magnetic resonance imaging for unrelated or nonspecific symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Contraceptive use and estrogen therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hepatic adenomas were rarely reported before the advent of OCPs in the 1960s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-adenoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The association between OCPs and the development of liver tumors was first described in 1973 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-adenoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Multiple subsequent studies have confirmed this association and have also demonstrated that the development of hepatic adenomas correlated with the dose and duration of hormonal therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-adenoma/abstract/6,8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8-11</a>]. The annual incidence is approximately 1 per 1,000,000 in women who have never used OCPs, compared with 30 to 40 per million in long-term users [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-adenoma/abstract/8,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,12</a>]. In a study comparing OCP use in 79 women with hepatic adenomas to 220 controls, the largest risk of development of hepatic adenoma occurred in women over the age of 30 years who had used OCPs for longer than 25 months, particularly those who had used OCPs with a high estrogenic component [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-adenoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Similar conclusions were reached in another report in which the duration of OCP use was significantly longer in women with adenomas compared with controls (73 versus 36 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-adenoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, the duration of use was as short as 6 to 12 months in approximately 10 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-adenoma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The introduction of low-dose estrogen contraceptives in recent years may have reduced the incidence of hepatic adenomas, although there have been no large epidemiologic studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-adenoma/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p>OCPs also affect the natural history of hepatic adenomas. Adenomas are more numerous, larger, and more likely to bleed in patients who take OCPs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-adenoma/abstract/4,11,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,11,15,16</a>]. In addition, regression of adenomas has been observed after discontinuation of OCPs with recurrence during readministration or pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-adenoma/abstract/8,17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,17-20</a>].</p><p>The mechanism by which estrogen therapy contributes to the development of hepatic adenomas is incompletely understood. One hypothesis is that estrogens directly cause the transformation of hepatocytes via steroid receptors. However, immunohistochemical studies of adenomatous and normal liver tissue for steroid receptors have been small and inconclusive. One study described positive staining for estrogen, progesterone, and androgen receptors in approximately one-third of patients while another showed no receptor staining of adenomatous tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-adenoma/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Anabolic androgen use</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The development of hepatic adenomas has been associated with the use of anabolic steroids for the treatment of aplastic anemia, Fanconi's syndrome, and muscle mass development in body builders and in transgender individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-adenoma/abstract/23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-26</a>]. Most cases are associated with the use of 17-alpha-alkylated steroids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-adenoma/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Similar to OCPs, androgens appear to predispose to multiple adenomas and frequently regress following discontinuation of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-adenoma/abstract/24,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Glycogen storage diseases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adenomas occur in patients with type I and III glycogen storage diseases (GSD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-adenoma/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. The incidence is up to 51 percent with type I and 25 percent with type III GSD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-adenoma/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. They usually occur before the age of 20 years, are more common in males, and are typically multiple. Resolution has been reported in some patients after dietary therapy and correction of insulin, glucose, and glucagon levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-adenoma/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The mechanism by which GSD promotes the development of hepatic adenoma is not known.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic mutations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One group described germline mutations in the APC genes and p53 genes in an infant with a hepatic adenoma and a family history of adenomatous polyposis coli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-adenoma/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The association between pregnancy and hepatic adenomas may be related to the increased endogenous levels of steroid hormones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-adenoma/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Several cases of ruptured hepatic adenoma during gestation have been described with a reported 59 percent maternal and 62 percent fetal mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-adenoma/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. The high mortality may be related to delays in diagnosis because of confusion with other conditions such as preeclampsia or pulmonary embolism.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hepatic adenomas are typically solitary lesions (70 to 80 percent) that vary in size from a few millimeters to several centimeters. The lesions are often in the right lobe of the liver. Approximately 10 percent are pedunculated. They are soft and smooth with a tan appearance, large prominent blood vessels on the surface and within the tumor with areas of hemorrhage and necrosis. There is usually no fibrous capsule; as a result, hemorrhage from an adenoma can freely extend into the liver (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F72131\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72131 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p>Microscopically, adenomas are composed of large plates of adenoma cells, which are typically larger than normal hepatocytes and contain glycogen and lipid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F51149\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51149 \">picture 2</a>). The nuclei are small and regular, and mitoses are almost never seen. There is notable absence of normal hepatic architecture, and the cells are arranged in normal or thickened trabeculae interspersed with prominent arteries and thin-walled blood vessels and sinusoids. Regular septa, portal tracts, and bile ductules are absent, a feature that helps distinguish it from non-neoplastic liver tissue and focal nodular hyperplasia. Kupffer cells may be present, but only in small numbers. Furthermore, they are nonfunctional, explaining the inability of most adenomas to take up <a href=\"topic.htm?path=technetium-tc-99m-sulfur-colloid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">technetium Tc-99m sulfur colloid</a>. The distinction from hepatocellular carcinoma is occasionally difficult, but can usually be made on the basis of the trabecular pattern and appearance of the tumor cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-adenoma/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>A classification of hepatic adenomas according to genotype and phenotype characteristics has been proposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-adenoma/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Of 96 cases of hepatic adenoma, three major groupings were identified: those with mutations in hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha (HNF1alpha), those with mutations in beta-catenin, and those with neither mutation and with inflammatory features. The most common mutation was in HNF1alpha, which was seen in 46 percent of adenomas. These were characterized by the presence of marked steatosis and lack of cytologic abnormalities or inflammatory infiltrates. By contrast, adenomas with mutations in beta-catenin (14 percent of cases) had frequent cytologic abnormalities and pseudo-glandular formation and had an increased potential for malignant transformation.</p><p>The third group (lacking these mutations) could be subdivided into two groups: those with and without inflammatory infiltrates. The authors noted that adenomas associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (or having histologic features bordering on hepatocellular carcinoma) were observed almost exclusively in the beta-catenin group, rarely in the HNF1alpha group, and never in inflammatory lesions. These observations suggest that adenomas with mutations in beta-catenin may be at increased risk for malignant transformation. Interestingly, certain radiologic features on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) correlate with the histologic subtypes, suggesting it may be possible to classify them by MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-adenoma/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. Further studies are needed to validate these findings and determine whether they may change the management of patients suspected to have a hepatic adenoma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As discussed above, the majority of hepatic adenomas are seen in young women who have a history of prolonged oral contraceptive (OCP) use. They are typically diagnosed because of abdominal pain localized to the epigastrium or right upper quadrant, during an imaging study done for unrelated reasons, and less commonly because of detection of a mass on clinical examination or as a sudden, life-threatening collapse associated with rupture and intraabdominal bleeding (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F58773\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58773 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Episodic abdominal pain localized to the epigastrium or right upper quadrant may reflect an enlarged liver, bleeding into the tumor, or tumor necrosis. The development of sudden, severe pain associated with hypotension reflects rupture into the peritoneum, an event associated with a mortality of up to 20 percent if not identified and appropriately treated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-adenoma/abstract/4,31,40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,31,40,41</a>]. The actual risk of bleeding is difficult to establish since estimates have been derived mostly from studies of predominantly symptomatic patients in whom the risk of bleeding may be as high as 25 to 64 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-adenoma/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. The presence of abdominal pain, a history of long duration of contraceptive use, sub-capsular location, and adenoma size &ge;35 mm are features associated with an increased risk of bleeding.</p><p>An abdominal mass can be identified in up to 30 percent of patients while hepatomegaly is present in approximately 25 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-adenoma/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Jaundice has been described and presumably reflects compression of the intrahepatic bile ducts by an enlarging tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-adenoma/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>].</p><p>Liver function test abnormalities are rare, but may be more frequent in patients with a hepatic adenoma compared with those with focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH), a diagnosis that may have similar clinical and radiologic features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-adenoma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=focal-nodular-hyperplasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Focal nodular hyperplasia&quot;</a>). Elevation of alkaline phosphatase and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) may be present, particularly in patients with intratumoral bleeding or multiple adenomas. Alpha fetoprotein (AFP) is normal except in patients in whom malignant transformation has occurred.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk of malignant transformation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of malignant transformation to hepatocellular carcinoma is difficult to ascertain from the literature. Two small studies reported the development of malignant transformation in 8 to 13 percent of patients, suggesting that it is not a rare occurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-adenoma/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. An increase in size on sequential imaging studies or a rise in serum AFP levels should raise concern that malignant transformation has developed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Adenomatosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adenomatosis has been classified as a distinct pathological entity from isolated hepatic adenoma. First described in 1985, it is characterized by the presence of more than 10 adenomas, lack of correlation with steroid medication or lack of resolution with steroid withdrawal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-adenoma/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>], lack of association with glycogen storage diseases (GSD), involvement in both men and women, and abnormal increases in serum alkaline phosphatase and GGT levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-adenoma/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>The distinction of hepatic adenoma(s) from adenomatosis may seem arbitrary since more than 10 adenomas have been documented in patients with GSD and those who use oral contraceptives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-adenoma/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>]. However, these cases do not fit the classification proposed above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-adenoma/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. There is no correlation between estrogen receptor status and hepatic adenomatosis since estrogen receptor-positive and negative tumors have been isolated from the same liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-adenoma/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>The conditions that predispose to adenomatosis are poorly understood. One theory is that the development of adenomatosis is associated with congenital or acquired abnormalities of hepatic vasculature. This hypothesis was supported in a study in which 5 of 15 patients with adenomatosis had evidence of abnormal vasculature: two had congenital absence of portal vein, one had portal venous thrombosis with cavernous transformation, and two had intrahepatic portosystemic shunts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-adenoma/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p>The natural history of adenomatosis is not well understood since the available information is derived from individual reports and small case series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-adenoma/abstract/48,49,52-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49,52-54</a>]. Hemorrhage appears to be common, particularly in patients who have adenomas larger than 4 cm that are in a subcapsular location. Bleeding occurred in five of eight patients (62 percent) in a series of patients seen at the Mayo Clinic during an 11-year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-adenoma/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]; this, compared with a bleeding rate of 26 percent in patients with hepatic adenomas seen during the same period. Malignant transformation has been documented in several case reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-adenoma/abstract/31,55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,55,56</a>]; it occurred in 2 of 15 patients in a series from the University of Pittsburgh [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-adenoma/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Adenomas in hepatic adenomatosis may be of the inflammatory, hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha mutated, or beta-catenin mutated subtype. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Pathology'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis should be made based upon the clinical setting, a combination of imaging studies, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> surgical resection. Percutaneous liver biopsy or fine-needle aspiration are usually <strong>not</strong> indicated because adenomas have a tendency to bleed following biopsy and because the amount of tissue obtained using these methods is frequently insufficient for establishing a diagnosis.</p><p>The diagnosis of a hepatic adenoma is frequently considered in the broader context of patients presenting with a focal liver lesion. An approach to such patients is presented separately. A common dilemma is the differentiation of an adenoma from focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH). Although the distinction can often be made based upon imaging characteristics, surgical resection may be required for definitive diagnosis and is at the same time curative. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=solid-liver-lesions-differential-diagnosis-and-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Solid liver lesions: Differential diagnosis and evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Multiple imaging modalities are usually required since similar radiologic features can be seen with any vascular tumor of the liver and because imaging characteristics are variable depending upon the presence of intratumoral hemorrhage, necrosis, and fat in the surrounding liver. However, the diagnosis may remain uncertain even after multiple imaging modalities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=solid-liver-lesions-differential-diagnosis-and-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Solid liver lesions: Differential diagnosis and evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adenomas are often first detected by ultrasound (US). However, sonographic characteristics are often non-specific and may mimic other benign or malignant liver lesions. Adenomas may appear well demarcated and hyperechoic because of the high lipid content of hepatocytes, but can also be heterogeneous because of intratumoral bleeding. Bleeding may also appear as calcifications. Necrosis may appear as hyperechoic areas with acoustic shadows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-adenoma/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Color Doppler US can assist in making the distinction from FNH because of the appearance of intratumoral and peritumoral vessels in the absence of a central arterial signal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-adenoma/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p>Where available, contrast-enhanced ultrasonography can be used to help make the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=contrast-enhanced-ultrasound-for-the-evaluation-of-liver-lesions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Contrast-enhanced ultrasound for the evaluation of liver lesions&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Computed tomography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Computed tomography (CT) has the advantage of acquiring images during noncontrast- and contrast-enhanced (arterial and venous) phases providing a dynamic sequence for evaluating focal liver lesions. Adenomas are typically well demarcated and have low attenuation or are isodense on noncontrast images of the liver. Contrast-enhanced scans may show peripheral enhancement during the early phase with subsequent centripetal flow during the portal venous phase, which is characteristic of adenoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-adenoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. During the late phase of the contrast-enhanced scans, the lesion may become isodense and then hypodense (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F68931\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef68931 \">image 1</a>). Adenomas often have areas of hemorrhage, necrosis, or fibrosis, giving them a heterogeneous appearance. The presence of fresh blood within the adenoma gives the appearance of a high-attenuating lesion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Magnetic resonance imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adenomas are usually well demarcated on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) because of the fat or glycogen content of the hepatocytes. However, MRI characteristics are highly variable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-adenoma/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Most adenomas are hyperintense on T1-weighted images (because of the presence of fat or glycogen) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-adenoma/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>] and on T2 images. The presence of enhanced T2-weighted images that enhance further with gadolinium administration is highly suggestive of the diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F79542\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef79542 \">image 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-adenoma/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Gadolinium enhancement is early, after which the lesion becomes isodense [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-adenoma/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p>Gadoxetic acid-enhanced MR imaging can differentiate between hepatic adenomas and focal nodular hyperplasia with a high sensitivity and specificity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-adenoma/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. The use of other gadolinium-based MR contrast agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gadobenate-dimeglumine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gadobenate dimeglumine</a>) for evaluating liver lesions is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=solid-liver-lesions-differential-diagnosis-and-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Solid liver lesions: Differential diagnosis and evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Technetium Tc-99m sulfur colloid scanning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As mentioned above, Kupffer cells may be present in adenomas, but only in small numbers. Furthermore, they are generally nonfunctional. Kupffer cells may be present histologically in adenomas with and without uptake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-adenoma/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p>Most adenomas do not take up <a href=\"topic.htm?path=technetium-tc-99m-sulfur-colloid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">technetium Tc-99m sulfur colloid</a>; thus, the scintigram shows a &quot;cold&quot; spot in the liver. However, a minority (as many as 25 percent in some reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-adenoma/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]) take up the technetium Tc-99m sulfur colloid, thus rendering them indistinguishable from FNH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-adenoma/abstract/64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65</a>]. FNH, on the other hand, shows equal or greater uptake of the radiolabeled agent compared with surrounding liver. Thus, technetium Tc-99m sulfur colloid scanning is generally not useful for establishing the diagnosis of an adenoma, but may be helpful when the clinical setting and results of other radiologic testing point to a diagnosis of FNH. In many centers, nuclear imaging has been largely replaced by Gd-BOPTA-enhanced MRI or dynamic multiphase CT angiography. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=solid-liver-lesions-differential-diagnosis-and-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Solid liver lesions: Differential diagnosis and evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Angiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Angiography is rarely used for the diagnosis of hepatic adenomas. Approximately one-half of adenomas have the typical features of a hypervascular well-circumscribed tumor with increased peripheral vascularity, in contrast to the central vessel seen in FNH.

Some authors have advocated a conservative approach in patients with small lesions (&lt;5 cm) with discontinuation of contraceptive medication, and close observation of the lesion with repeated imaging and alpha fetoprotein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-adenoma/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. Complete regression of tumor has been documented after discontinuing steroid medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-adenoma/abstract/17,67,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,67,68</a>]. However, even after discontinuation of steroid medications, growth, rupture, and malignant transformation (despite a decrease in size of the adenoma) have been documented [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-adenoma/abstract/15,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,69</a>]. As a result, other authors recommend resection of all adenomas regardless of size if technically feasible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-adenoma/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>The European Association for Study of the Liver recommends contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging at a six month interval to determine if there is regression of a large adenoma to less than 5 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-adenoma/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. Patients with adenomas that do not resolve or that enlarge after six months of observation following discontinuation of oral contraceptives should undergo treatment. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Symptomatic patients and those with large adenomas'</a> below.) &#160;</p><p>One study of 118 patients with hepatic adenoma demonstrated that 15 percent of the lesions regressed to &lt;5 cm after six months, 25 percent after one year, and approximately 60 percent after two years. This study suggested that the follow-up interval for imaging typical hepatic adenomas be extended to 12 months to avoid unnecessary hepatic resection in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-adenoma/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">A woman contemplating pregnancy or who is pregnant</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients have generally been advised against pregnancy since the behavior of a liver adenoma during pregnancy is unpredictable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-adenoma/abstract/72,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,73</a>]. Resection or ablation of the lesion prior to pregnancy may be the best option for such patients. We recommend that patients with adenomas &gt;2 cm undergo radiofrequency ablation prior to attempting pregnancy. </p><p>However, the optimal approach to management is still uncertain. In a report of 12 patients with hepatic adenomas who had 17 pregnancies, no intervention was required in 14 pregnancies, two pregnancies were delivered by cesarean section at weeks 34 and 36, and one patient underwent a radiofrequency ablation in the first trimester [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-adenoma/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. A multicenter prospective study with 50 patients is ongoing in Europe and will provide valuable information about the approach to adenoma management in pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-adenoma/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].</p><p>A ruptured adenoma during pregnancy should be managed with appropriate resuscitation and surgical resection. The optimal management of an incidentally identified adenoma during pregnancy is unclear. Because of the unpredictable behavior and risk of rupture, surgical resection should be recommended for patients with large or symptomatic adenomas.

Surgical options include enucleation, resection, and rarely liver transplantation.

Mortality from elective surgical resection is &lt;1 percent, and resection of some peripherally located adenomas can even be accomplished laparoscopically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-adenoma/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>].</p><p>Patients who present with abdominal pain and hypotension as a result of intraperitoneal bleeding from a ruptured adenoma have a mortality of up to 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-adenoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Such patients should undergo surgery for definitive resection and control of hemorrhage. Emergency surgery is associated with a mortality of 5 to 8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-adenoma/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. Preoperative selective arterial embolization using coils and particulate matter may control bleeding and reduce mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-adenoma/abstract/68,84,85\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,84,85</a>].</p><p>Nonsurgical interventions, including transarterial embolization or ablation, can be used in the management of symptomatic or large hepatic adenomas. Transarterial embolization has been used to treat patients with bleeding hepatic adenomas and to occasionally reduce the size of such tumors prior to surgical resection. In a systematic review of 40 studies, including 851 patients with hepatic adenoma, transarterial embolization was performed in 151 patients (17 percent), and surgical resection was avoided in 68 of these patients (45 percent). Adenoma regression was seen in 75 percent of cases and complete resolution was seen in 10 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-adenoma/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. </p><p>Radiofrequency ablation has also be used to treat hepatic adenomas, however, many patients require multiple sessions to achieve complete ablation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-adenoma/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. Radiofrequency ablation may be a good option for adenomas that are not amenable to surgical resection. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23173051\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatic adenomas are uncommon benign epithelial liver tumors that develop in an otherwise normal-appearing liver. They are seen predominantly in young women (20 to 44 years old), are frequently located in the right hepatic lobe, and are typically solitary (70 to 80 percent), although multiple adenomas have been described in patients with prolonged contraceptive use, glycogen storage diseases, and hepatic adenomatosis. Adenomas range in size from 1 to 30 cm. Symptoms such as abdominal pain are more likely with larger lesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F58773\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58773 \">figure 1</a>). Adenomas are typically diagnosed because of abdominal pain localized to the epigastrium or right upper quadrant, during an imaging study done for unrelated reasons, and (less commonly) because of detection of a mass on clinical examination or as a sudden, life-threatening hemodynamic collapse associated with rupture and intraabdominal bleeding. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatic adenomas are strongly associated with the use of oral contraceptives, anabolic androgens, and glycogen storage disease. They are less commonly associated with pregnancy and diabetes mellitus. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Etiology and incidence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis should be made based upon the clinical setting, a combination of imaging studies, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> surgical resection. Percutaneous liver biopsy or fine-needle aspiration is usually <strong>not</strong> indicated because adenomas have a tendency to bleed following biopsy and because the amount of tissue obtained using these methods is frequently insufficient for establishing a diagnosis (see <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above). The diagnosis of a hepatic adenoma is frequently considered in the broader context of patients presenting with a focal liver lesion. An approach to such patients is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=solid-liver-lesions-differential-diagnosis-and-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Solid liver lesions: Differential diagnosis and evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The natural history and prognosis of hepatic adenomas is not well established. As a result, decisions regarding management of these tumors depend upon symptoms, size, number, location, and certainty of the diagnosis. An approach to common clinical scenarios is presented above. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who present with intraperitoneal bleeding from a ruptured adenoma, surgery is recommended for resection and control of hemorrhage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We recommend treatment for all patients with symptomatic hepatic adenomas and adenomas &gt;5 cm (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For women with an adenoma in the setting of oral contraceptive use, we suggest repeating the imaging study in 6 to 12 months after stopping oral contraceptives. Patients with adenomas that do not resolve or that enlarge should undergo treatment, and options include surgery, transarterial embolization, or radiofrequency ablation.
