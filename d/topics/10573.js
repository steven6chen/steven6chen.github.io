A major paradigm shift in strategy occurs after neurologic death. The goal of antemortem management is to maintain cerebral perfusion pressure, while the postmortem goal is to maintain the perfusion of all potential donor organs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64564\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64564 \">table 1</a>). Following neurologic death, circulatory collapse occurs within hours if there is no medical intervention.</p><p>Optimal management of the potential organ donor is a continuum of care that requires coordination between the medical and nursing teams in the ICU and the organ procurement organization (OPO). This allows for early identification of potential donors, timely determination of neurologic death, donation discussions with the family that are appropriately timed and sensitive to the family's emotional needs, medical interventions to preserve organ function, evaluation to determine donor potential and suitability, and recovery and placement of organs. The goals of this coordinated approach are to preserve the option of donation, enhance the likelihood of donation and organ recovery, and also to support grieving families with issues and decisions surrounding end-of-life care. </p><p>The process and timing of organ recovery is a complex task. In the absence of pediatric support, every effort should be made to transfer the child to a local pediatric critical care unit. If this is not possible due to patient instability, the local pediatric critical care unit should offer consultation or consider traveling to the referring unit to provide expertise in patient management. Organ recovery depends on the physiological stability of the donor. An unstable donor may require early organ recovery to avoid losing potential transplantable organs, whereas a stabilized donor with optimal management can be maintained for a longer period of time. In many instances, organizing appropriate laboratory and diagnostic testing, acceptance and placement of donor organs, coordination of organ recovery teams, and availability of an operating suite may require active medical management of the donor for 24 hours or longer. Prolonging the time interval between neurologic death and organ retrieval has not been associated with decreased organ procurement rates nor compromised quality of organ function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>The pathophysiology of neurologic death and management of the potential pediatric organ donor are discussed here. The determination of neurologic death and assessment of the pediatric patient for potential organ donation are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-brain-death\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of brain death&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-the-pediatric-patient-for-potential-organ-donation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of the pediatric patient for potential organ donation&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGIC CONSEQUENCES OF NEUROLOGIC DEATH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Regardless of the initial cerebral insult, the end point of neurologic death is complete ischemia and irreversible loss of brainstem function. In some countries (eg, the United States) the term and medicolegal definitions focus on whole &quot;brain death&quot; (brain and brainstem), while in others (eg, the United Kingdom) the term and concept of &quot;brainstem death&quot; is used. </p><p>It is important to understand the pathophysiology of neurologic death so that appropriate supportive management strategies can be provided to the potential donor. Neurologic death unleashes a cascade of autonomic, endocrine, hematological, inflammatory, and cardiorespiratory responses that threaten organ viability. Most, if not all, donors will develop this cascade as neurologic death occurs. </p><p>In experimental models, neurologic death is characterized by an orderly rostrocaudal progression of ischemia and related autonomic symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Once the ischemic threshold of the brain is exceeded, death of the cerebrum is followed by progression to the brainstem. Widespread cerebral damage is associated with increased vagal activity manifested by signs of bradycardia, hypotension, and decreased cardiac output. Pontine ischemia leads to a combination of vagal and sympathetic signs. Next, in an attempt to maintain cerebral perfusion, Cushing's triad of hypertension, bradycardia, and abnormal breathing patterns are elicited. Finally, when the ischemic process extends into the brainstem, an outpouring of catecholamines known as an &quot;autonomic storm&quot; occurs.</p><p>In humans, the physiological events associated with neurologic death are less predictable and depend in part upon the cause and rate of progression of the neurologic injury (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypoxic-ischemic-brain-injury-in-adults-evaluation-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in adults: Evaluation and prognosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=elevated-intracranial-pressure-icp-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) in children: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>). Nonetheless, many patients will display predictable pathophysiological patterns in the minutes and hours leading up to and following neurologic death. Understanding and anticipating these events will allow for optimal management of the patient. The phases and key clinical characteristics associated with neurologic death are discussed in the following sections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Autonomic storm</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The final event in neurologic death is often necrosis of the parasympathetic nuclei in the medulla oblongata and unchallenged sympathetic activation, leading to an outpouring of catecholamines. This is known as an &quot;autonomic storm,&quot; or &quot;hyperdynamic phase,&quot; because of the associated tachycardia. Increases of catecholamine levels of up to 1200-fold have been described; maximal levels are directly proportional to the rate of onset of neurologic death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. In animal models, this occurs within minutes after brain death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>During the autonomic storm, elevated levels of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">epinephrine</a>, norepinephrine, and dopamine lead to increased heart rate, mean arterial pressure, cardiac output, and massive peripheral vasoconstriction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Although cardiac contractility is increased, left ventricular output is functionally reduced because of the massively increased systemic vascular resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. The massive outpouring of catecholamines results in ischemic changes to the myocardial and conductive tissue, further impairing cardiac output [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>] and potentiating arrhythmias. Other causes of myocardial dysfunction include cytolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], abnormal cardiac receptor function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], and production of a myocardial inhibitory protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The autonomic storm is closely followed by a phase of hemodynamic compromise, which presents the greatest risk to donor organs. The autonomic storm is short lived because the spinal cord becomes ischemic, which stops the sympathetic overdrive. In addition, destruction of the sympathetic spinal cord tracts leads to loss of autonomic regulation, resulting in peripheral vasodilation. As a result, heart rate, blood pressure, and myocardial contractility decrease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Untreated hypotension results in coronary artery hypoperfusion and further myocardial tissue damage. </p><p>Hemodynamic instability due to myocardial dysfunction and loss of systemic vascular resistance results in hypoperfusion of potential donor organs and is the greatest cause for organs becoming unsuitable for transplantation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulmonary</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pulmonary edema may occur during the autonomic storm (hyperdynamic phase of neurologic death); it is caused by systemic vasoconstriction and pulmonary volume overload, leading to pulmonary edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. </p><p>Additionally, neurologic death predisposes patients to pulmonary infection for several reasons. First, neurologic death abolishes the cough reflex, and most brain dead individuals are in the supine position for days, leading to suboptimal mucus clearance and associated atelectasis. Second, the sigh mechanism, which is present in normal health and is important in maintaining lung volume, is absent in neurologic death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Lastly, the larynx and pharynx are atonic and non-functional in the clinical context of neurologic death, which increases the likelihood of aspiration of pharyngeal contents into the tracheobronchial tree, without clinical symptoms of aspiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Endocrine abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neurologic death leads to alteration and destruction of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis. This can lead to the following endocrine abnormalities: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Diabetes insipidus</strong> &ndash; Levels of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), cortisol, and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) fall dramatically following brain death, and are undetectable within hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/4,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,10</a>]. Depletion of ADH causes diabetes insipidus (DI), which is the most common endocrine abnormality following brain death, occurring in up to 87 percent of adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>] and about 40 percent of pediatric patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Although not pathognomonic, the onset of DI in severely brain-injured patients should raise the consideration of midbrain dysfunction and neurologic death in comatose patients. Depletion of ADH and ACTH causes hypovolemia and further aggravates hemodynamic instability if left untreated. Treatment of DI with intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasopressin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">vasopressin</a> may allow weaning of inotropic support required to maintain cardiac output in brain dead patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmopressin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Desmopressin</a> is also used to pharmacologically treat DI. (See <a href=\"#H459765792\" class=\"local\">'Diabetes insipidus'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Thyroid dysfunction</strong> &ndash; Levels of triiodothyronine (T3) drop and become very low within hours of brain death. Thyroxine (T4) levels are typically normal or low and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) does not rise in response to these low levels because the hypothalamus and pituitary are no longer functional. This rapid decline of free T3 levels and peripheral conversion to inactive reverse T3 (rT3) leads to a &quot;sick euthyroid syndrome&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. It remains unclear whether this condition contributes to the myocardial depression often seen after neurologic death and whether thyroid hormone treatment is beneficial to the potential donor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/21-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-25</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Anaerobic metabolism</strong> &ndash; Neurologic death and the loss of hormonal regulation leads to changes in metabolism, most notably a shift from aerobic to anaerobic metabolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Impaired mitochondrial function results in a lactic acidosis, which is a marker of oxygen delivery to the tissues. Some of these metabolic changes may be caused by the deficit of thyroid hormone. </p><p/><p>These endocrine abnormalities are often addressed by hormone replacement therapy (HRT). (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Hormone management'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Hematological</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hematocrit may rise acutely within minutes after neurologic death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. This is most likely due to acute vascular depletion and transcapillary fluid shifts caused by acute increases in hydrostatic pressure. The hematocrit may fall later, most likely because of fluid redistribution, hemolysis, and the dilutional effect of aggressive fluid resuscitation.</p><p>Coagulation disturbances can occur during and after the progression to brain death. A hypercoagulable state can arise as large amounts of prothrombotic agents are released into the circulation following the initial cerebral insult. The autonomic storm also causes the release of cerebral gangliosides and thromboplastin and can result in disseminated intravascular coagulopathy (DIC). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-in-infants-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disseminated intravascular coagulation in infants and children&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Inflammatory changes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neurologic death results in activation of platelets, leukocytes, and endothelial cells. Production of cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, tumor necrosis factor, and interleukin 6 typically increases after neurologic death, as measured by messenger RNA expression. These cytokines, along with catecholamines released during the autonomic storm, are thought to cause decreased myocardial contractility and contribute to hemodynamic instability after neurologic death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>The organs of brain dead donors are more immunogenic than live donors, possibly because of upregulation of the expression of major histocompatibility complex class I and II antigens. This may predispose to earlier and more severe rejection as compared with grafts from live donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Mobility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The concept of death has been synonymous with immobility. However, abnormal movements can occur in brain dead patients. The classic described movement is the &quot;Lazarus sign&quot;. It consists of flexion at the elbows, shoulder adduction, lifting of the arms, dystonic hand posturing, and crossing of the hands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. These abnormal movements occur most often in the first 24 hours and do not exclude the determination of neurologic death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Abnormal movements also have been described when pharmacologic agents, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naloxone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">naloxone</a>, are used as novel therapies to improve lung function in the potential donor. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-brain-death#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of brain death&quot;, section on 'Neurologic examination'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H708189952\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT OF THE PEDIATRIC DONOR</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H122575353\"><span class=\"h2\">Donor management goals</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Specific donor management goals (DMG) have been developed to guide clinical care, including minimizing inotropic use, normalization of blood pressure, oxygenation and ventilation parameters, correction of electrolyte disturbances, and controlling fluid balance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F91611\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91611 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Studies in adults have demonstrated that meeting DMGs improves chances of organ recovery and graft function post-transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Achieving DMGs in children has shown similar results. As an example, in a non-published study of 148 pediatric brain dead donors reviewed over a five year period, when DMGs were met &ge;80 percent of the time 4.39 organs were transplanted per donor, whereas only 3.37 organs were transplanted per donor when &le;80 percent of DMGs were met [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p>The following sections discuss important aspects about management of the pediatric donor. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemodynamic monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the first hour(s) following the autonomic storm and progression to neurologic death, hypotension becomes the overriding hemodynamic issue (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F79594\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79594 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Because of autonomic paralysis, the heart rate may not increase in response to hypovolemia. Unrecognized or untreated hypotension with continued hypoperfusion will render organs unsuitable for transplantation. Aggressive management to restore normal hemodynamics and maintain organ perfusion is essential for successful organ recovery. </p><p>Invasive monitoring of central venous pressure (CVP) and arterial blood pressure are imperative to guide the clinician in the management of the potential donor. At a minimum, an indwelling arterial catheter for continuous blood pressure monitoring and central venous access should be secured. Hemodynamic parameters vary with age and should be taken into account when monitoring and treating the potential pediatric organ donor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63033\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63033 \">table 4</a>). Serial measurements of lactate can help to assess the adequacy of oxygen delivery to the tissues. Monitoring of mixed venous oxygen saturation (SVO<sub>2</sub>) also may be beneficial in determining adequate cardiac output. If lactate and SVO<sub>2</sub> are within normal ranges, the clinician may permit lower blood pressures and thus minimize use of vasopressors. There is increasing use of near infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) as a noninvasive monitoring tool. NIRS may be beneficial to alert the medical team of changes in oxygen delivery and the need for intervention. Conversely, elevations in serum lactate and the development of a metabolic acidosis provide evidence of tissue ischemia and should prompt immediate attention and treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. Traditional indicators of cardiac output such as capillary refill and urine output may not be reliable following brain death because of hypothermia and diabetes insipidus (DI). Nonetheless, catheterization of the bladder and meticulous measurement of fluid input and output is essential to assess response to therapies.</p><p>Pulmonary artery catheters (PAC) are rarely used in children. Placement of a PAC must be weighed against the potential risks for an individual patient. Consultation with the transplant surgeon, medical director of the organ procurement organization (OPO), and the pediatric intensivist can assist in making this determination. A PAC may provide information that is useful in guiding treatment for older adolescents or adults with the following indications:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation for thoracic organ donation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac ejection fraction &lt;45 percent by echocardiography </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CVP &gt;15 mmHg</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coexisting valvular disease, cardiomyopathy, severe lung disease, persistent hypotension</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Inotropes and vasopressors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neurologic death is associated with increased blood pressure to maintain cerebral perfusion pressure prior to herniation. This is followed by profound vasodilation after herniation. This results in tremendous alterations in cardiac output, ultimately resulting in hypotension and end-organ dysfunction. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Autonomic storm'</a> above.) </p><p>Hypotension is typically treated with a combination of fluids and drugs with inotropic and vasopressive effects. This combined approach helps prevent excessive volume administration which can result in pulmonary edema, making the lungs less suitable for transplantation. Commonly used drugs with inotropic and vasopressive effects are shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76583\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76583 \">table 5</a>). </p><p>The following are appropriate DMGs for systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) for the pediatric organ donor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F91611\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91611 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neonate &ndash; SBP 60-90; &#160;DBP 35-60</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infant &ndash; SBP 80-95; &#160;DBP 50-65</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Toddler &ndash; SBP 85-100; &#160;DBP 50-65</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>School age &ndash; SBP 90-115; DBP 60-70</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adolescent &ndash; SBP 110-130; &#160;DBP 65-80</p><p/><p>A consensus conference recommended adjustment of fluids, inotropes, and vasopressors every 15 minutes based on serial hemodynamic measurements.

This is because the use of adrenergic agents has been associated with nonfunction of cardiac grafts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>], suggesting that use of these drugs may cause, or are a marker for, myocardial injury. The evidence for this effect is mixed and may not apply to renal or liver transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-42</a>]. Despite these uncertainties, the use of pharmacologic agents to maintain adequate blood pressure and organ perfusion is generally well accepted, and these agents are routinely used by many centers to support cardiac output and oxygen delivery to the tissues. Specific considerations to guide the choice and dosing of inotropes and vasopressors are discussed in the following sections.

If the combination of fluid and dopamine up to maximum dose of 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">micrograms/kg/min</span> is not sufficient to maintain blood pressure, another vasopressor can be added to counteract the peripheral vasodilatation that occurs after brain death. This is because low dose dopamine has predominantly dopaminergic and beta-adrenergic action. In animal models, doses less than 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">micrograms/kg/min</span> increase splanchnic and renal perfusion. Low dose dopamine has also been shown to stimulate alveolar fluid clearance in brain dead patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. In higher doses, alpha-adrenergic effects predominate and vasoconstrict blood flow in tissue beds.</p><p>Many transplant programs are reluctant to recover and transplant a heart from a donor requiring significant inotropic support.

In addition, replacement of thyroid hormone is helpful during dopamine treatment because dopamine inhibits TSH, thus exacerbating an altered hypothalamic pituitary axis in the patient who is progressing towards or has completed brain death. Evidence supporting HRT in the potential donor remains controversial. However, HRT is routinely used by many OPOs during donor management.

The commonly used alpha-agonists include norepinephrine, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenylephrine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">phenylephrine</a>. These agents are more commonly used in older children, however their use is not restricted to this population of patients. The concern with these alpha-agonists is the possible occurrence of excessive peripheral and splanchnic vasoconstriction. This may compromise perfusion of the donor organs, specifically the splanchnic bed, limiting the potential for transplantation. Epinephrine is commonly used in smaller children for both alpha and beta agonist effects. Additionally, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasopressin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">vasopressin</a> is used in many centers to control DI while also augmenting blood pressure. </p><p>In patients with DI and associated hemodynamic instability, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasopressin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">vasopressin</a> should be the primary agent used to control DI. For this indication, doses of 0.5 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">milliunits/kg/hour</span> are used, titrated to decrease urine output to 2 to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">cc/kg/hour</span>.

The use of vasopressin may allow norepinephrine to be weaned. The use of norepinephrine has been associated with a reduced one-year survival in heart transplant recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>], whilst vasopressin use increases rate of organ recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Hormone replacement therapy should be considered if hypotension persists despite appropriate support with inotropes and pressors.</p><p>The hypertensive crisis that occurs during the autonomic storm can result in serious damage to the end organs. Opinions are divided as to whether antihypertensive management should be instituted. Many experts feel that the catecholamine surge is relatively short lived and does not require aggressive management. Additionally, reducing blood pressure when the body is compensating for increased intracranial pressure (ICP) can be detrimental to the patient. Many of the commonly used antihypertensive agents have longer half-lives, and determining when to start these agents can be problematic. Short acting and titratable intravenous medications such as sodium <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroprusside-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">nitroprusside</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=esmolol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">esmolol</a> may be suitable agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/50-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-52</a>] but can rapidly decrease blood pressure with resultant hypotension. These agents should be used with extreme caution in this patient population. Intermittent doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydralazine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">hydralazine</a> can be considered in some cases in which treatment of hypertension might be warranted. </p><p>Although hypotension is the most common hemodynamic problem in brain dead patients, hypertension can occur intraoperatively during organ recovery. This phenomenon occurs because of a sympathetic spinal reflex to the stimulus of surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>]. If this occurs, an inhalational anesthetic agent can be used to control the blood pressure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Arrhythmias</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A baseline 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) should be performed to assess the intrinsic conduction of the donor's heart, followed by continuous ECG monitoring (telemetry) to detect subsequent arrhythmias. </p><p>A variety of atrial and ventricular arrhythmias can occur during and after brain death. Hypovolemia, hypothermia, electrolyte abnormalities, increased intracranial pressure (ICP), myocardial ischemia, oxygenation issues, acid base disturbances, and myocardial contusion may contribute to the development of these arrhythmias. The use of inotropes and vasopressors can also predispose to arrhythmias, especially in the presence of an ischemic myocardium.</p><p>To prevent arrhythmias, maintenance of normal body temperature and fluid and electrolyte balance is important. Any electrolyte abnormalities should be aggressively treated and corrected. Hypokalemia commonly occurs in this patient population secondary to excessive diuresis caused by DI <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hyperglycemia. Overventilation following brain death may cause a respiratory alkalosis and exacerbate hypokalemia. Hypomagnesemia can occur with profound diuresis. Magnesium should be aggressively replaced and levels maintained in a normal range if ventricular arrhythmias are noted. Hypothermia is a potent proarrhythmic stimulus and should be prevented. Respiratory alkalosis (induced by over-ventilating the donor) may be desirable as it can reduce arrhythmias, especially ventricular arrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, excessive alkalosis may reduce oxygen delivery to tissues by shifting the hemoglobin oxygen dissociation curve to the left (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F81216\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81216 \">figure 1</a>). Therefore, most providers try to maintain the pH between 7.3 and 7.45 as outlined in the pediatric DMGs. Careful interpretation of the ECG is required as ST-segment change and J-waves are commonly seen in brain dead patients with electrolyte abnormalities and hypothermia.</p><p>Bradycardia is the most common arrhythmia in the brain dead donor and only requires treatment if it is associated with hypotension. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Atropine</a> is ineffective in treating bradycardia in brain dead patients because the inhibitory effect that it normally exhibits on the vagus nerve is lost. In patients who require treatment for bradycardia, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dopamine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">dopamine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">epinephrine</a> are the agents of choice. If these agents are not effective, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoproterenol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">isoproterenol</a> might be added to the regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. However, isoproterenol can induce hypotension (because of vasodilation) or paradoxical bradycardia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Therefore, transthoracic or transvenous pacing may be a better alternative in this instance. &#160;</p><p>Tachyarrhythmias and ventricular arrhythmias may be symptoms of electrolyte imbalances, hypotension, or may be caused by inotropic drugs. If <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dopamine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">dopamine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">epinephrine</a> are the presumptive causes of the dysrhythmia, stopping these drugs and changing to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norepinephrine-noradrenaline-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">norepinephrine</a> may be helpful to reduce beta receptor stimulation. Body temperature below 28&deg;C may cause resistant ventricular arrhythmias. If ventricular arrhythmias occur, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">lidocaine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">amiodarone</a> can be used. Correction of temperature, electrolyte and acid base disturbances, and hypoxia may reduce arrhythmias as well.</p><p>Potential donors are at risk for cardiac arrest, especially those with persistent or untreated hypotension. In fact, up to 25 percent of potential donors are lost due to hemodynamic instability or cardiac arrest following brain death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. A cardiac arrest does not preclude a patient from successfully donating organs if adequate organ perfusion is maintained [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Preexisting &quot;do not resuscitate&quot; (DNR) orders are invalidated following brain death unless otherwise specified by the family or the OPO coordinator. Resuscitation procedures are similar to protocols used for other patients. The idea of &quot;resuscitating&quot; an already dead child may be extremely distressing to parents coming to terms with recent loss. Occasionally, parents may oppose the continuation of aggressive donor management even after explanation, and their wishes should be respected. Medical staff may also have difficulty understanding the need to resuscitate a dead child who is a donor. It is important to emphasize that resuscitation continues to honor the wishes of the family for their child to become a donor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Respiratory</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The lungs are the transplantable organ most likely to be compromised after neurologic death, preventing recovery for transplantation. Meticulous care of the donor is essential to maximize lung recovery. The inflammatory response and neurogenic pulmonary edema associated with increased ICP contributes to the pathology affecting lung recovery for transplantation. </p><p>Potential pediatric organ donors should be intubated with a cuffed endotracheal tube (ETT) rather than the uncuffed type of ETT that is often used for some pediatric patients. For donors with an uncuffed ETT in place, changing to a cuffed ETT should be considered to minimize aspiration risk and protect the lower airway. The balloon of the cuffed ETT should be inflated to a high cuff pressure (inflated until no air leak is observed, often &gt;25 cm H<sub>2</sub>O), to protect the lungs and minimize any chance of aspiration. Diligent pulmonary toilet is important to protect the lungs, including regular suctioning of the hypopharynx for accumulation of debris, elevating the head of the bed, turning of the patient to avoid atelectasis, and appropriate oral care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H264541895\"><span class=\"h3\">Ventilatory settings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ventilatory settings for the brain dead patient should be carefully adjusted to maintain a relatively normal physiologic state. The main goals are to prevent hypoxemia, atelectasis, ventilator-induced lung damage, and restore normal oxygenation and ventilation. The ventilation strategy differs from that used prior to neurologic death, in which the most important goal of mechanical ventilation was to maintain adequate oxygenation and assist with reduction of cerebral edema. With the onset of neurologic death, oxygen consumption and CO<sub>2</sub> production is greatly decreased. Such ante mortem strategies to reduce CO<sub>2</sub> can exacerbate a significant respiratory alkalosis after death, as respiratory drive ceases and CO<sub>2</sub> production declines. Alkalosis can cause damage to the donor organs because a lower PaCO<sub>2</sub> can cause peripheral vasoconstriction and alter oxygen delivery to tissues by shifting the <span class=\"nowrap\">hemoglobin/oxygen</span> dissociation curve to the left. The leftward shift impairs oxygen delivery to the tissues and the anaerobic metabolism following brain death that can result in a worsening lactic acidosis. Thus, ventilator adjustment to normalize the CO<sub>2</sub> and pH is essential to the care of the potential donor. </p><p>Volume-limited mechanical ventilation is a commonly used mode of ventilation in most circumstances. Pressure ventilation is used if the peak and plateau airway pressures are very high due to poor compliance or elevated mean airway pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60</a>]. Decelerating flows should be set on the ventilator because the flow is more laminar at the end of inspiration; this approach decreases mean airway pressure and resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Intensivists are increasingly employing lung protective strategies prior to neurologic death, using lower tidal volumes and higher positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP). This type of ventilation strategy may be beneficial to the potential donor to ensure adequate lung recruitment and protect the lungs from overinflation. The anti-inflammatory effects of higher PEEP may also be beneficial to the potential donor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. </p><p>The initial setting of PEEP should be a minimum of 5 cm H<sub>2</sub>O [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>], to maintain a reasonable functional residual capacity (FRC) and prevent atelectasis. The fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>) should be kept &lt;0.5 as long as oxygen saturations (SaO<sub>2</sub>)<sub> </sub>are above 95 percent. A PaO<sub>2</sub> near or above 100 mmHg (9.3 and 13.3 kPa) is desirable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. The PaCO<sub>2</sub> should be kept within the normal range (35 to 45 mmHg), which corresponds to a pH 7.35 to 7.45. This range corresponds to a pH that is optimal for unloading of oxygen at the tissue level. </p><p>The tidal volume should be set between 8 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg,</span> with low respiratory rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Setting higher tidal volumes can minimize atelectasis but may predispose to barotrauma. If lung injury is present or the peak pressure generated is too high, the tidal volumes can be dropped to 6 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> to prevent barotrauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. If these lower tidal volumes are used, higher PEEP may be required to prevent atelectasis and maintain FRC. High peak inspiratory pressures (PIP) and PEEP may decrease venous return and may exacerbate hypotension, thereby requiring volume loading to maintain adequate cardiac output. </p><p>To determine whether the patient's lungs are suitable for organ donation, an oxygen challenge is performed. The potential donor is preoxygenated by providing a FiO<sub>2</sub> of 1.0, and the PaO<sub>2</sub> is measured by arterial blood gas analysis. If the PaO<sub>2</sub> is &gt;300 mmHg, the lungs are considered suitable for donation in many centers.</p><p>Lung recruitment maneuvers may be needed when the chest radiograph shows atelectasis or under-inflation. There are many different strategies to improve lung recruitment. Sustained inflation with manual ventilation and a pressure gauge is one option. Another approach is use of the San Antonio Lung Transplant (SALT) protocol, which includes pressure-cycled ventilation for two hours, with inspiratory pressure of 25 cm H<sub>2</sub>O and PEEP of 15 cm H<sub>2</sub>O, followed by a return to conventional volume-controlled ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. Using airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) mode of ventilation for lung recruitment has shown promise in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/67,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">67,68</a>]. Experience with APRV in children is limited.

Bronchoscopy should be performed safely and can be used for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Early bronchoscopy is a valuable addition to the initial assessment of the potential organ donor, may identify potential pathogens to guide antibiotic therapy, and provides therapeutic bronchial toilet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/14,37,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,37,70</a>]. Repeated bronchoscopies may be indicated in some individuals. In some instances there is no need for a bronchoscopy if the potential donor is too unstable or will not tolerate the procedure because the lungs are too damaged. &#160;</p><p>The goal of bronchoscopy is to assess the airways, identify anatomic variations, evaluate for airway trauma, and to locate, characterize, and remove secretions. The bronchoscopists should pay special attention to the re-pooling of purulent secretions after initial removal. Lower respiratory tract samples are collected in small aliquots (&lt;20 cc) via limited bronchoalveolar lavage for immediate microbiological examination and culture. The amount of fluid used for lavage should be kept to a minimum because extensive lavage will lead to new infiltrates and transient worsening of oxygenation, which may confuse the clinical picture for the evaluating transplant team.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Fluids and electrolytes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adequate organ perfusion and oxygenation are essential to preserve organ function for transplantation.

Excessive fluid resuscitation can lead to volume overload and pulmonary edema, with impaired gas exchange, hypoxemia, and end organ ischemia. A balanced approach using fluids, inotropic support, and HRT has been adopted by many centers to restore normal circulating volume and maintain acceptable hemodynamics in the potential donor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F91821\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91821 \">table 6</a>). &#160; </p><p>Judicious use of crystalloid or colloid boluses is one of the first steps to replenish or maintain adequate vascular volume and sustain blood pressure. Although CVP may not be the best measure for intravascular volume, many OPOs have a goal to maintain CVP around 8 to 10 mmHg. Glucose-containing fluids should never be used for resuscitation because these fluids may induce an osmotic diuresis, further complicating fluid and electrolyte disturbances. Use of synthetic colloids should be avoided since these agents may precipitate or exacerbate renal insufficiency and hypoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. After the potential donor has been resuscitated, the serum sodium and glucose levels guide the choice of maintenance fluid. Excessive administration of normal saline may lead to hyperchloremic acidosis. Lactated Ringer solution or Plasma-Lyte A may be better alternatives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. The &quot;hemodynamic profiling&quot; of a potential donor with meticulous measurement of fluid input, output and vital signs, and invasive monitoring techniques including measurement of CVP and cardiac function, will help in directing the therapy required to maintain a normal blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. End organ function, which is commonly used to determine cardiac output, may not be reliable in the brain dead patient. As examples, urine output is not a reliable indicator of renal function following neurologic death because of DI, and capillary refill may not be a reliable indicator of peripheral perfusion because of hypothermia. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Hypernatremia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sodium levels may be elevated due to antemortem practices to reduce ICP (eg, fluid restriction, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">mannitol</a>, hypertonic saline, and diuretic therapy). If hypernatremia occurs in conjunction with increased urine output, the possibility of DI should be investigated. (See <a href=\"#H459765792\" class=\"local\">'Diabetes insipidus'</a> below.)</p><p>If hypernatremia is present, every effort should be made to restore serum sodium levels to a normal range. This is because sodium levels in excess of 160 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> may contribute to cellular edema, dysfunction, apoptosis and necrosis, and these factors are thought to contribute to primary graft failure and decreased graft function after orthotopic liver transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. However, there are no controlled studies to prove whether hypernatremia should be a contraindication to organ recovery for donation, specifically the liver. In practice, many liver transplant programs will not accept organs from donors with hypernatremia. Attention to serum sodium early in the course of donor management is therefore strongly recommended.</p><p>To avoid or correct hypernatremia, the fluid status should be evaluated and DI corrected if present. Isotonic solutions should be used to restore circulating volume until the patient has achieved a euvolemic state. DI is managed by replacing urine output with hypotonic fluids and by titrating pharmacologic agents to reduce but not stop urine output. (See <a href=\"#H459765792\" class=\"local\">'Diabetes insipidus'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H459765792\"><span class=\"h3\">Diabetes insipidus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diabetes insipidus (DI) occurs in approximately 40 percent of pediatric organ donors following brain death. DI is caused by lack of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and is characterized by hypernatremia and high output of dilute urine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F82673\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82673 \">table 7</a>) (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Endocrine abnormalities'</a> above). The high urine output leads to intravascular fluid depletion if left uncorrected. It also produces biochemical and electrolyte abnormalities, including hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, hypocalcemia and hypophosphatemia; these abnormalities should be treated aggressively to prevent arrhythmias. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-causes-of-central-diabetes-insipidus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and causes of central diabetes insipidus&quot;</a>.) </p><p>The management goal for DI is to achieve a euvolemic and normonatremic state while reducing, but not completely stopping, urine output. The first step of management is fluid replacement to restore a normal circulating volume and support blood pressure and tissue perfusion. In a hypotensive patient, fluid resuscitation should be performed with isotonic or colloid solutions. Once euvolemia has been established, the fluid requirement consists of the usual maintenance needs plus replacement of urine output. The appropriate solute content of the maintenance fluid depends on serum sodium and glucose levels. Hypernatremia is common in the setting of DI and may also be compounded by treatment of cerebral edema prior to death. Maintenance and replacement fluids should be low in sodium (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-central-diabetes-insipidus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of central diabetes insipidus&quot;</a>). In most cases, urine output should be replaced with quarter-normal or half-normal saline. Additionally, free water can be administered through a nasogastric (NG) tube when necessary to correct the hypernatremia. Rapid changes in serum osmolarity are of no concern since neurologic death has occurred. Most donors have high glucose levels and little or no exogenous glucose is required. If glucose levels fall, dextrose should be added to replacement fluids to maintain normal glucose levels. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Hyperglycemia'</a> below.) </p><p>Pharmacologic treatment with ADH analogues should be contemplated early if polyuria persists despite fluid therapy (eg, urine output greater than 5 to 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg/hour)</span>. Early reports suggested that use of ADH analogs in the potential donor were associated with poor outcomes for kidney transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. However, a large randomized controlled trial showed no detrimental effect on early or late kidney graft function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. </p><p>The two available ADH analogs are the naturally occurring arginine <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasopressin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">vasopressin</a> (AVP) or the synthetic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmopressin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">desmopressin</a> (1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin, DDAVP). Both analogs have antidiuretic activity, but only vasopressin has vasopressor action. Vasopressin has the benefit of increasing blood pressure and can decrease vasopressor requirements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/21,71,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,71,78</a>]. In one study, vasopressin helped to maintain cardiac output and improved serum osmolality. A separate small retrospective study showed that vasopressin exerted a pressor effect at time of organ recovery; children treated with vasopressin were more likely to tolerate weaning off of alpha-agonists than a control group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. Desmopressin has a theoretical advantage over vasopressin because it is not a splanchnic vasoconstrictor and does not negatively affect hepatic, renal, and pancreatic blood flow. Nonetheless, clinical outcomes are similar for the two drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. A small number of children may be resistant to vasopressin; desmopressin should be used alone or in combination with vasopressin in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. Desmopressin also may be useful in the donor with an ongoing coagulopathy because of platelet effects from this agent. Treatment of the donor with desmopressin has been associated with improved renal allograft survival (85.4 percent versus 73.6 percent, P = 0.003); the combined use of desmopressin and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dopamine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">dopamine</a> needs further evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. Many donor management protocols favor vasopressin to pharmacologically treat DI because of its shorter half-life as compared with desmopressin. When desmopressin is used, it can be discontinued two to three hours prior to going to the operating room, to allow metabolism of this agent prior to organ transplant. In this case, urine output of more than 3 to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">cc/kg/hour</span> should be replaced to maintain a euvolemic state in the donor. </p><p>Drug dosing for patients with DI is adjusted according to the clinical response. The dosing and duration of action of these two agents differ slightly:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasopressin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Vasopressin</a> &ndash; Vasopressin is administered by continuous IV infusion, in doses of 0.5 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">milliunit/kg/hour</span> and titrated to reduce urine output to 2 to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">cc/kg/hour</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/31,82\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,82</a>]. This agent has a half-life of 10 to 35 minutes. Note that this is a lower dose than when vasopressin is used to treat hypotension. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Vasopressors'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmopressin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Desmopressin</a> (DDAVP) &ndash; DDAVP is preferably administered by continuous IV infusion starting at doses of 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/hour</span> and titrated to reduce urine output to 2 to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">cc/kg/hour</span>. This agent has a half-life of 75 to 120 minutes. Subcutaneous and intramuscular injections are avoided because of the possibility of diminished absorption from the tissues in this patient population. Intranasal DDAVP is not recommended. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Hyperglycemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neurologic death frequently leads to hyperglycemia, most likely caused by catecholamine release during the autonomic storm, decreased metabolic rate of the brain during and after neurologic death, and the use of exogenous inotropes and steroids. Catecholamines cause glucose release and decrease tissue sensitivity to insulin. Pancreatic endocrine function is generally preserved after neurologic death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. Hyperglycemia may be exacerbated by administration of dextrose in intravenous fluids, which can result in further volume losses from an osmotic diuresis.</p><p>In some cases, hyperglycemia is associated with central DI and low CO<sub>2</sub> production. This association has been described as a pathognomonic sign for the onset of neurologic death, and is known as &quot;Turner's triad&quot;. Hyperglycemia occurs most frequently and the full triad is not always present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Hyperglycemia raises the serum osmolality and can exacerbate fluid loss through an osmotic diuresis. Glycemic control is important with a goal of maintaining blood glucose levels between 60 and 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (3.3 to 8.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. Higher glucose levels may be acceptable if the transplant surgeon intends to keep the islet cells active for pancreas transplantation. If the blood glucose levels remain persistently above 180 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (10 to 11.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> intravenous insulin should be commenced as a continuous infusion at doses of 0.05 to 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/kg,</span> and titrated to the desired glucose levels. Insulin also may be dosed on a sliding scale; however, it may be more difficult to achieve tight glucose control with a sliding scale. Subcutaneous administration of insulin is discouraged because this may lead to erratic and unpredictable absorption (a &quot;depot effect&quot;). Glucose levels should be checked frequently to avoid hypoglycemia, especially in infants. It is important to monitor potassium levels, as insulin infusions can promote hypokalemia. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Hormone management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For potential donors who fail to respond to conventional medical management for hemodynamic stabilization, hormonal replacement therapy (HRT) is suggested. HRT can help reduce the need for vasoactive agents and improve chances of organ recovery. HRT is recommended by the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) for organ donors unresponsive to conventional resuscitation measures as manifested by poor cardiac output, inadequate organ perfusion pressures, and increasing lactic acidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/52,84,85\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,84,85</a>]. This practice is also applicable to pediatric organ donors. Because of preliminary data suggesting that aggressive medical treatment incorporating HRT improves recovery of organs and leads to a higher incidence of organs transplanted in adults and children, many centers now routinely use HRT for all potential donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In these centers, HRT is an important component of support for hemodynamically stable donors. Those donors who are hemodynamically unstable will require additional support with fluid resuscitation and <span class=\"nowrap\">inotropic/vasopressive</span> agents, in addition to HRT (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F91821\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91821 \">table 6</a>). </p><p>Commonly used agents and doses for hormonal resuscitation in pediatric donors include (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F56534\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56534 \">table 8</a>): &#160;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Methylprednisolone</a> &ndash; 20 to 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> bolus IV, repeated thereafter at 8 to 12 hour intervals, depending on the duration of donor management. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Hydrocortisone</a> (Solucortef) is administered by some OPOs in a continuous infusion of 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/hour,</span> not to exceed 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/hour</span>. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=levothyroxine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Levothyroxine</a><strong> </strong>&ndash; 0.8 to 1.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">micrograms/kg/hour</span> IV. In the hemodynamically unstable child, treatment may be initiated with a bolus dose of 1 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">micrograms/kg</span>. Infants and small children may require larger bolus and infusion doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. For hemodynamically stable donors, no bolus dose is required and a continuous infusion of levothyroxine can be initiated. Some centers prefer to use triiodothyronine (T3) instead of levothyroxine (T4) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The dosing range of T3 for pediatric patients is 0.05 to 0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg/hour</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Both T3 and T4 can be titrated to effect. T4 is a prohormone and is converted to active T3, but this process may be inhibited by conversion of T4 to inactive rT3 during the catecholamine storm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. T3 is more potent and has a shorter half-life and onset of action, and therefore a more predictable action. However, T3 is seldom used in the United States because of its expense. If the donor becomes hypertensive or tachycardic with levothyroxine, the dose can be reduced. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasopressin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Vasopressin</a> &ndash; Given to patients with high urine output caused by DI, at a dose of 0.5 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">milliunits/kg/hour,</span> titrated to decrease urine output to 3 to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">cc/kg/hour</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/31,82,86\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,82,86</a>] (see <a href=\"#H459765792\" class=\"local\">'Diabetes insipidus'</a> above).&nbsp;<a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmopressin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Desmopressin</a> may be used as an alternative.

(See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Hyperglycemia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p>HRT seeks to correct the hormonal changes and deficiencies that are commonly seen after neurologic death. These include depletion of antidiuretic hormone (ADH), triiodothyronine (T3), thyroxine (T4), cortisol, and insulin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The depletion of thyroid hormone contributes to mitochondrial dysfunction, anaerobic metabolism (lactic acidosis), and organ dysfunction after neurologic death. There is some evidence that this process can be reversed by thyroid hormone replacement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Corticosteroids are believed to attenuate proinflammatory cytokines, decrease the upregulation of cytokines, and prevent leukocyte migration into the new allograft. Other potential benefits of steroids may lie in their ability to alter adrenergic receptors and regulate vascular tone by increasing sensitivity to catecholamines. Steroids also have been shown to stabilize pulmonary function, reduce lung water accumulation, and increase lung recovery from donors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methylprednisolone</a> improves oxygenation leading to a progressive increase in PaO<sub>2</sub> and decrease in FiO<sub>2</sub> requirements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. </p><p>The role of HRT for donor management remains controversial. Studies in adults suggest that HRT, consisting of the combination of thyroxine, cortisol, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasopressin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">vasopressin</a> and insulin, may restore aerobic metabolism, normothermia, organ stability, and cardiac function, replenish ATP, and diminish requirements for inotropes and bicarbonate replacement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/26,88-90\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,88-90</a>]. In a large study in the United States, donor resuscitation with a combination of corticosteroids, thyroid hormones, and vasopressin reduced the odds of early transplant recipient death by 46 percent, and graft dysfunction by 48 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. There was an increase in 22.5 percent of total organs transplanted per donor when systematic combination hormonal replacement program was used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/24,92,93\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,92,93</a>]. In addition, there is increasing evidence that HRT, along with optimization of CVP, significantly increases heart and lungs for transplantation and improves graft function for the transplant recipient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/94,95\" class=\"abstract_t\">94,95</a>]. A meta-analysis of thyroid hormone administration in brain dead donors failed to support a routine role for thyroid hormone administration in the brain dead donor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p>Less information is available regarding the use of HRT for pediatric donors, and there are no controlled trials. However, in a retrospective review of 1903 pediatric donors published in abstract form, HRT was associated with significantly increased odds of having the liver and at least one kidney and lung transplanted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. There was no significant increase in the odds of the heart being transplanted. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Thermal regulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After neurologic death, the donor often becomes hypothermic and requires active measures to maintain normal body temperature. This is because neurologic death leads to failure of thermoregulatory mechanisms. Heat loss occurs via convection and radiation. The vasodilation that occurs after neurologic death results in further heat loss, exacerbating thermoregulatory instability. The administration of resuscitation fluids maintained at room temperature can easily contribute to hypothermia as well.</p><p>Hypothermia causes a variety of problems that affect donor management and organ viability. Hypothermia is a direct myocardial depressant and will lead to bradycardia and hypotension. As body temperature drops, the kidney's ability to maintain tubular concentration gradients is lost, resulting in a cold-induced diuresis. Temperatures below 32&ordm;C adversely affect coagulation. The oxyhemoglobin curve is shifted to the left decreasing oxygen delivery to the tissues further exacerbating tissue acidosis and contributing to organ deterioration.</p><p>All efforts should be made to keep the patient's temperature above 35&ordm;C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/65,97\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,97</a>]. If possible, all potential donors should be managed in private rooms within the intensive care unit (ICU), not only for privacy but also for more effective environmental temperature manipulation. The ambient temperature in the room should be increased. Passive heating methods such as the use of warmed blankets and space blankets (such as the Bear Hugger) are easy to use and valuable in reducing radiant heat loss. If these measures are inadequate, active rewarming may be needed. Warmed intravenous fluids and warmed gastric and bladder lavage may be effective. All ventilator gases should be humidified and heated to 38.5&ordm;C.</p><p>In the unlikely event that elevated body temperature of the donor occurs from active warming measures, all blankets should be removed, intravenous fluids should not be warmed, and a cooling blanket should be used if needed. Antipyretics can be administered via nasogastric (NG) tube or by suppository every four to six hours, although the effect of antipyretics in the brain dead donor are unclear. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although severe overwhelming infection such as meningococcemia may rule out donation, the majority of patients with bacteremia are suitable candidates after adequate treatment with antibiotics. Organs transplanted from bacteremic donors do not transmit bacterial infection nor result in poorer outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/98,99\" class=\"abstract_t\">98,99</a>]. There are reports of successful transplantation from donors with bacterial meningitis following antibiotic therapy for at least 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/100,101\" class=\"abstract_t\">100,101</a>]. Transmissions of infections, many times viral, to immunosuppressed recipients may lead to severe life-threatening or even fatal illness, even if the infection is unusual or of modest virulence. The risk of transmitting such infections can be reduced by a careful medical and travel history from the donor's family. A Donor Risk Assessment Interview (DRAI) is routinely performed for any donor, including children. Transplant centers must have sophisticated molecular and antigen detection facilities to permit early diagnosis if an unusual infection is suspected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/102-104\" class=\"abstract_t\">102-104</a>]. Criteria for excluding a potential donor because of infection are determined by the transplant coordinator and the medical director of the organ procurement organization. &#160;</p><p>Once the donor status is confirmed, blood cultures should be obtained and repeated after 24 hours, if necessary. A tracheal aspirate, urine sample, and blood should be cultured. Any infection must be appropriately treated with antibiotics. Broad spectrum antibiotics should be initiated when infection is suspected or proven. The duration of treatment is typically determined by the transplant and infectious disease teams. Routine treatment of the potential donor with broad-spectrum antibiotics for <strong>prophylactic </strong>purposes is not universally practiced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. However, because of evidence that the lungs of organ donors are particularly susceptible to infection, prophylactic antibiotic therapy is utilized by many centers in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/105,106\" class=\"abstract_t\">105,106</a>]. The choice of antibiotic varies between centers, but the use of antibiotics should provide broad spectrum coverage to treat common respiratory pathogens or ventilator-associated pneumonia (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">vancomycin</a> with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=piperacillin-and-tazobactam-sodium-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">piperacillin-tazobactam</a>).

Treatment of hematologic abnormalities may also be determined if the patient is symptomatic with ongoing bleeding or if there are coagulation disturbances that require correction prior to or during surgical recovery of donor organs. </p><p>Sites for potential ongoing loss of blood should be assessed regularly.

These coordinators are available to work with staff and families in all stages of end-of-life care and organ donation, even before the formal declaration of neurologic death occurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/107,108\" class=\"abstract_t\">107,108</a>]. Staff from the OPO are trained to approach families for authorization. </p><p>A team approach has been adopted by many institutions when discussing donation with families of potential pediatric organ donors, in which the bedside nurses and intensivists work in concert with the OPO personnel. This practice is encouraged by the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Organ Donation Collaborative's report on best practices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/109\" class=\"abstract_t\">109</a>]. Coordinated efforts between OPO coordinators and medical professionals are designed to improve authorization rates while assisting families with end-of-life care issues. There are family-specific or cultural reasons that organ donation may be declined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/110\" class=\"abstract_t\">110</a>]. In some instances, coordinators and staff are matched to the donor family culture, language and religion to provide the most sensitive and effective interface for the grieving family and to improve organ donation rates. Involvement of palliative care teams also has been identified as another resource to assist the intensive care unit (ICU) team, parents, and families facing end-of-life issues with their child [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/111\" class=\"abstract_t\">111</a>]. &#160;</p><p>Organ donation is a process that begins when a critically ill or injured patient is identified as a potential donor. Early recognition of potential death and a timely referral to the OPO is valuable because it prevents a rushed approach to donation. A successful process incorporates clinical triggers that alert the OPO of a possible donor. Appropriate time is required to determine donor potential, perform extensive testing, and determine suitability and placement of organs recovered for transplantation. This time period may exceed 24 hours or more in some instances. The patient must be continually monitored and medically supported until death has been declared or until medical therapies are withdrawn. Determination of death must be made in a timely and efficient manner to allow for procurement of organs as soon as possible following determination of neurologic death. However, there may be delay due to logistic issues. Delays from time of neurologic death to recovery of organs has been associated with poorer outcomes in organ function post-transplant or loss of potential donors in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/112\" class=\"abstract_t\">112</a>], although another review concluded that an increase in time interval between neurologic death and organ procurement was not associated with reduced organ procurement rates nor salvageable organs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-the-potential-pediatric-organ-donor/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Supportive care of the potential organ donor is a multidisciplinary endeavor and requires inter-agency cooperation and management strategies. The pediatric intensive care specialist and critical care team is instrumental in the success and quality of organs recovered from donors. The medical management of the potential organ donor requires knowledge of the unique physiologic derangements that occur in this patient population. Care of the organ donor should be viewed as a continuum of care with ongoing emotional support for the family during the most difficult time in their lives as they endure the loss of their child. Social workers, chaplains, child life specialists, and family support personnel from the OPO are important components of an effective support team. Thus, the donation process relies on all caregivers working to support the potential donor and family through end-of-life issues. This process is essential to maximize organ recovery from a limited population of patients. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h3\">Nursing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The role of the intensive care nurse is vital in the successful management of a potential organ donor. Due to the intensive contact with the patient, the nurse in the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit (PICU) may be the first healthcare practitioner to identify a potential donor. Nurses in the PICU are an important resource to access in discussions with the donor's family.</p><p>Intensive nursing care is critical to maintain homeostasis and preserve organ viability. In addition to the management issues discussed above, routine care of the potential donor includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Repeated turning to prevent pressure sores</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lubrication and protection of eyes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nasogastric (NG) tube insertion to provide drainage of secretions and to reduce or prevent aspiration</p><p/><p>Respiratory care is vital to maintain the integrity of the potential lung donor. Chest physiotherapy and pulmonary toilet to maintain lung volume is required. In some centers in the United States, chest physiotherapy vest devices are used for continuous mucus clearance therapy. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Respiratory'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p>Meeting donor management goals (DMGs) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F91611\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91611 \">table 2</a>) increases successful organ recovery and results in more organs transplanted in children (see <a href=\"#H122575353\" class=\"local\">'Donor management goals'</a> above). We make the following recommendations based on best practices from the organ donation and transplantation community. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiovascular</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cardiovascular events following brain death frequently include a hyperdynamic phase (autonomic storm), followed by severe hypotension. Maintaining organ perfusion after neurologic death is critical to organ preservation.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest continuous use of invasive central venous and arterial pressure monitors in all potential organ donors, regardless of age (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Fluid intake and output should be monitored and recorded. Children under the age 10 years are commonly managed without pulmonary artery catheters (PACs). In older children, PACs may be used at the discretion of the clinicians. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Hemodynamic monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypotension is almost universal after neurologic death and is typically managed with a combination of judicious fluid administration to restore circulating volume, and drugs with inotropic and vasopressor effects. Appropriate management goals include: maintaining the central venous pressure (CVP) at 8 to 10 mmHg, and maintaining urine output of &gt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg/hour</span> for the older child, and 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">cc/kg/hour</span> for the younger child (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F91611\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91611 \">table 2</a>). Diabetes insipidus (DI) commonly contributes to hypovolemia and should be treated. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Fluids and electrolytes'</a> above and <a href=\"#H459765792\" class=\"local\">'Diabetes insipidus'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management of hypotension includes judicious use of crystalloid and colloid boluses to restore normal circulating volume, in conjunction with use of inotropic agents for blood pressure support. Use of synthetic colloids is discouraged as they can potentiate renal failure. Glucose-containing fluids should not be used for volume expansion because these may promote osmotic diuresis. Excessive fluid administration can increase the risk of pulmonary edema. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Fluids and electrolytes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If judicious fluid boluses do not achieve these goals, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dopamine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">dopamine</a> should be administered for inotropic support (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76583\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76583 \">table 5</a>). We suggest NOT administering dopamine at rates greater than 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">micrograms/kg/minute</span> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Dopamine'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serial measurements of lactate can help to assess the adequacy of oxygen delivery to the tissues. Monitoring of mixed venous oxygen saturation (SVO<sub>2</sub>) also may be beneficial in determining adequate cardiac output. If lactate and SVO<sub>2</sub> are within normal ranges, the clinician may permit lower blood pressures and thus minimize use of vasopressors. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Hemodynamic monitoring'</a> above.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vasopressors with alpha agonist effects (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">epinephrine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norepinephrine-noradrenaline-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">norepinephrine</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenylephrine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">phenylephrine</a>) may be added for vasoconstriction and additional hemodynamic support (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76583\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76583 \">table 5</a>). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasopressin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Vasopressin</a> is often used to treat concomitant diabetes insipidus, and has the added benefit of increasing systemic vascular resistance. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Vasopressors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arrhythmias are common and may be caused or exacerbated by electrolyte disturbances, inotropes, hypovolemia, hypothermia, hypoxia, acid base disturbances, and myocardial ischemia or damage. Bradyarrhythmias should be treated only if they are associated with hypotension. Bradyarrhythmias will not respond to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">atropine</a> in patients who have progressed to brain death. In patients who require treatment for bradycardia, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">epinephrine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dopamine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">dopamine</a> are preferred agents. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoproterenol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Isoproterenol</a> may be considered for this use, but can cause a drop in blood pressure. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Arrhythmias'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h2\">Electrolytes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients frequently develop hypernatremia following neurologic death. This may be caused by diabetes insipidus <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sodium administration for treatment of increased intracranial pressure (ICP) during cerebral resuscitation, rendered prior to brain death in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diabetes insipidus is characterized by dilute urine production and intravascular volume depletion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F82673\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82673 \">table 7</a>). Treatment includes restoration of normal circulating volume using isotonic fluids, followed by administration of hypotonic fluid for urine output replacement and maintenance fluids, in conjunction with pharmacologic agents. The goal of treatment is to decrease, but not completely stop, urine output. (See <a href=\"#H459765792\" class=\"local\">'Diabetes insipidus'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-central-diabetes-insipidus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of central diabetes insipidus&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperglycemia may be caused by catecholamine release <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> exogenous inotropes, steroids, or decreased or absent cerebral metabolism of glucose. Hyperglycemia can contribute to osmotic diuresis. Blood glucose concentrations should be monitored and maintained between 60 and 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>. In some cases this can be accomplished by minimizing the use of exogenous glucose. If blood glucose levels are consistently greater than 180 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (10 to 11.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> we suggest treatment with insulin (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>), administered as a continuous intravenous infusion. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Hyperglycemia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31\"><span class=\"h2\">Ventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All potential organ donors will require mechanical ventilation to maintain appropriate ventilation and oxygenation. A cuffed endotracheal tube (ETT) (with high cuff pressure) should be used to minimize the risk of aspiration in children, regardless of age. Ventilator settings should be tailored to maintain adequate oxygenation, normalize ventilation, and prevent atelectasis. Oral care, regular suctioning of the hypopharynx, and elevation of the head of the bed will help reduce the risk of aspiration and infection. Ventilatory strategies <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> alveolar recruitment maneuvers may be necessary to improve oxygenation by reducing atelectasis. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Respiratory'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32\"><span class=\"h2\">Hormonal replacement therapy</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hormonal replacement therapy with a combination of corticosteroids, thyroid hormone, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasopressin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">vasopressin</a>, and insulin appears to increase rates of successful organ recovery from adult organ donors that are unresponsive to or failing conventional resuscitation measures, as manifested by poor cardiac output, inadequate organ perfusion pressures, and increasing lactic acidosis. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Hormone management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hormonal resuscitation therapy should be considered early in the course of managing the potential pediatric organ donor. Glucocorticoids and thyroid hormone are routinely used as a part of donor management in many centers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F56534\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56534 \">table 8</a>). When the donor is unresponsive to or failing conventional hemodynamic resuscitation measures, we suggest treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vasopressin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">vasopressin</a> to assist in blood pressure control and also as a treatment for DI, if present. Vasopressin can be combined with glucocorticoids and thyroid hormone in the management of the hemodynamically unstable donor. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33\"><span class=\"h2\">Antibiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evidence of infection should be rigorously sought and treated in the potential organ donor.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Routine use of broad-spectrum antibiotics for prophylactic purposes in the organ donor is not universal. Prophylactic or pre-emptive antibiotics are commonly used in many centers in the United States for this select population following declaration of neurologic death because of the increased incidence of lower respiratory tract infection or colonization. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypothermia prevention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thermoregulatory mechanisms fail during the progression and upon completion of brain death. Hypothermia can promote arrhythmias, cold diuresis, decreased organ perfusion, and exacerbate an ongoing coagulopathy.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The temperature of the potential organ donor should be monitored and maintained in a normal range through passive measures (blankets, ambient heat, and warmed ventilator gasses) and active measures (warmed intravenous fluids, gastric <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bladder lavage).
