An estimated two to five million such events occur annually in the United States, although the true incidence is unknown due to under diagnosis and underreporting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enhanced-elimination-of-poisons/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>Management of the poisoned patient begins with a thorough evaluation, recognition that poisoning has occurred, identification of the agent(s) involved, assessment of severity, and prediction of toxicity. Therapy involves the provision of supportive care, prevention of poison absorption, and, when appropriate, the administration of antidotes and enhancement of elimination of the poison.</p><p>Methods to enhance the rate of elimination of poisons following a toxic ingestion are reviewed here. General issues regarding the management of toxic ingestions, and specific issues related to decontamination and gastric emptying are discussed separately.

The main methods of enhancing the elimination of toxins are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F57040\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57040 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>General indications for enhanced elimination techniques include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ingestion of a poison whose elimination can be enhanced.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Failure of a patient to respond to maximal supportive care.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical course is predicted to be complicated based on the nature <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> concentration of the toxin, impaired clearance of the toxin, comorbid illness, concomitant severe electrolyte or other laboratory derangements that can be corrected with enhanced elimination, or some combination of these elements.</p><p/><p>In all cases, the expected benefits of the use of an enhanced elimination technique must be carefully weighed against the risk of potential complications associated with the technique.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MULTIPLE-DOSE ACTIVATED CHARCOAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple-dose activated charcoal (MDAC) is a commonly used method for enhancing the elimination of toxins and may play an important role in specific poisonings. MDAC is discussed in detail separately.

Altering the pH converts a lipid-soluble intact acid (HA) or base (BOH) in the tubular lumen into the charged salt (A- or B+):</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160;HA &#160; &#160;&lt;&mdash;&gt; &#160; &#160;H+ &#160; + &#160; A-</p></div></div><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160;BOH &#160; &#160;&lt;&mdash;&gt; &#160; &#160;B+ &#160; + &#160; OH-</p></div></div><p>The charged particle is lipid-insoluble and cannot easily move back across the renal epithelium. This leads to a marked increase in drug excretion.</p><p>Raising the urine pH to 7.5 to 8.0 in patients poisoned with weak acids (such as salicylates and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenobarbital-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenobarbital</a>) will drive the first reaction to the right, producing the desired increase in concentration of the charged salt (A-). Importantly, phenobarbital is the only barbiturate for which alkalinization is indicated, as short-acting barbiturates are metabolized in the liver, not eliminated via the kidney [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enhanced-elimination-of-poisons/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>Urinary acidification (urine pH below 5.5) with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ammonium-chloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ammonium chloride</a> or ascorbic acid was historically used to treat intoxications with weak bases such as amphetamines, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quinidine</a>, or phencyclidine. However, this practice has been abandoned, as efficacy has not been established and iatrogenic toxicity (from severe acidemia) can occur.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications and efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Drugs that are likely to respond to urinary alkalinization usually meet four criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enhanced-elimination-of-poisons/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They are predominantly eliminated unchanged by the kidney</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They are distributed primarily in the extracellular fluid compartment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They are minimally protein-bound</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They are weak acids with pKa ranging from 3.0 to 7.5</p><p/><p>Urinary alkalinization may be useful for the drugs listed in the following tables: (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F56838\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56838 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F75710\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75710 \">table 3</a>).</p><p>The clinical course of phenobarbital-poisoned patients may be improved by the use of urinary alkalinization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enhanced-elimination-of-poisons/abstract/5,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,9</a>]. One study of 16 phenobarbital-poisoned patients found that the concomitant use of both urinary alkalinization and MDAC doubled the rate of elimination and shortened the period of unconsciousness by up to 50 percent compared with patients receiving supportive care alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enhanced-elimination-of-poisons/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. No comparable data exist showing improved clinical outcomes with the use of urinary alkalinization in other types of poisoning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enhanced-elimination-of-poisons/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Urinary alkalinization is the most effective single method short of hemodialysis to enhance salicylate excretion, producing a mean elimination half-life of 5 hours versus half-lives of 8 and 19 hours in patients treated with forced diuresis or standard supportive care, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enhanced-elimination-of-poisons/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

This is generally done by administering an IV bolus of 1-2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/kg</span> of 8.4 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a>, followed by continuous infusion of sodium bicarbonate. The fluid for continuous infusion is mixed by placing 150 mEq of sodium bicarbonate into one liter of 5 percent dextrose in water (D5W). Prior to the initiation of therapy, baseline measurements of electrolytes, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, glucose, systemic pH, urinary pH, and serum drug concentrations should be performed. Placement of a Foley catheter is recommended to accurately measure urine output.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Adults</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After initial fluid resuscitation and intravenous bolus of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a>, the sodium bicarbonate continuous infusion should be administered at approximately 200 to 250 <span class=\"nowrap\">cc/h</span>. The rate should be titrated based on the urinary and systemic pH, which should be monitored throughout treatment. Intravenous fluid should be adjusted to maintain a urine pH &ge;7.5 and serum pH &lt;7.60.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Children</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After initial fluid resuscitation and intravenous bolus of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a>, the sodium bicarbonate continuous infusion should be administered at approximately 1.5 times maintenance fluids (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maintenance-fluid-therapy-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maintenance fluid therapy in children&quot;</a>). The rate should be titrated to maintain a urine pH &ge;7.5. Increases in serum pH up to 7.60 are well tolerated in patients with normal renal function. Subsequent fluid administration should be based on urine output and ongoing losses. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maintenance-fluid-therapy-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maintenance fluid therapy in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetazolamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Acetazolamide</a> should <strong>not</strong> be used to alkalinize the urine. Acetazolamide raises urine pH by lowering systemic pH, which may cause clinical deterioration in some cases. Close monitoring of blood and urine pH, electrolytes, respiratory status, and urine output is important when diuresis and urinary alkalinization procedures are performed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=salicylate-aspirin-poisoning-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Salicylate (aspirin) poisoning in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=salicylate-poisoning-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Salicylate poisoning in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Contraindications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urine alkalinization is contraindicated in patients with established or incipient renal failure, pulmonary edema, and cerebral edema. In addition, volume overload may complicate therapy in patients with preexisting cardiac disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enhanced-elimination-of-poisons/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complications of alkalinization include hypokalemia, excessive alkalemia, and ionized hypocalcemia, which results from increased protein binding of calcium. The administration of 20 to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=potassium-chloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">potassium chloride</a> may be required if the plasma potassium concentration falls during urinary alkalinization. Monitoring and repletion of ionized calcium is recommended to prevent a deterioration in cardiac function.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">HEMODIALYSIS AND HEMOPERFUSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hemodialysis (HD) is rarely needed in the care of poisoned patients, although HD is used in greater than 95 percent of patients in whom an extracorporeal method is employed to enhance poison elimination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enhanced-elimination-of-poisons/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. During HD, up to 400 mL of blood per minute passes through an extracorporeal circuit in which toxic compounds in blood diffuse through a semipermeable membrane down a concentration gradient into a dialysate. Electrolyte disturbances and metabolic acidosis induced by certain drugs also can be readily corrected with this intervention. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-replacement-therapy-dialysis-in-acute-kidney-injury-metabolic-and-hemodynamic-considerations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal replacement therapy (dialysis) in acute kidney injury: Metabolic and hemodynamic considerations&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Hemoperfusion refers to the circulation of blood through an extracorporeal circuit containing an adsorbent such as activated charcoal or polystyrene resin. In contrast to HD circuits, hemoperfusion devices contain thin, highly porous membranes and adsorbents that provide a large surface area to directly bind toxins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enhanced-elimination-of-poisons/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Clearance rates are higher with hemoperfusion than HD if the adsorbent binds the ingested toxin; the extraction ratio for hemoperfusion approximates 1.0 for some poisons, and drug clearance rates approach the rate of blood flow through the hemoperfusion circuit.</p><p>Continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) has gained acceptance as an effective alternative treatment. It includes continuous veno-venous hemofiltration (CVVHF) and continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration (CVVHDF) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enhanced-elimination-of-poisons/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The evidence for these techniques is scant. In general, CRRT has lower clearance rates than conventional HD. It might offer some benefit in unstable or hypotensive patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enhanced-elimination-of-poisons/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p>Peritoneal dialysis is <strong>much less effective</strong> than HD or hemoperfusion, and is rarely if ever indicated in the care of poisoned patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HD is most useful in removing toxins with the following characteristics:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low molecular weight (&lt;500 daltons)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Small volume of distribution (&lt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/kg)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low degree of protein-binding</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High water solubility</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low endogenous clearance (&lt;4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per kg)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High dialysis clearance relative to total body clearance.</p><p/><p>The utility of HD and hemoperfusion is limited when the drug is not concentrated in the extracellular fluid because of high lipid solubility <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> tight tissue binding. These characteristics are present with tricyclic antidepressants, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a>, and calcium channel blockers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tricyclic-antidepressant-poisoning\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tricyclic antidepressant poisoning&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digitalis-cardiac-glycoside-poisoning\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Digitalis (cardiac glycoside) poisoning&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-channel-blocker-poisoning\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Calcium channel blocker poisoning&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Hemodialysis removes the toxic metabolites of methanol and ethylene glycol, corrects acid-base abnormalities, and reduces end-organ sequelae and mortality associated with these poisonings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enhanced-elimination-of-poisons/abstract/14,17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,17-19</a>]. Although HD clears ethylene glycol and methanol efficiently, HD is not commonly indicated when acidosis is not present, as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fomepizole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fomepizole</a> effectively blocks the activation of these alcohols to the toxic acidic species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enhanced-elimination-of-poisons/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methanol-and-ethylene-glycol-poisoning\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Methanol and ethylene glycol poisoning&quot;</a>.) </p><p>However, early HD may be prudent and more cost effective for methanol poisoned patients that present with high serum concentrations but no acidosis since endogenous clearance of methanol in those treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fomepizole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fomepizole</a> is slow. HD also substantially increases the rate of elimination of isopropanol, salicylates, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lithium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lithium</a>, although data regarding clinical end points are sparse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enhanced-elimination-of-poisons/abstract/14,22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,22-25</a>]. A 2015 systematic review supports the use of hemodialysis to remove <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a> in cases of overdose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enhanced-elimination-of-poisons/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Drugs adsorbed by activated charcoal can be extracted by hemoperfusion, and the rate of removal may exceed that achieved with hemodialysis. The extraction ratio of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a> with hemodialysis, for example, is approximately 50 percent as compared with 99 percent at the beginning of hemoperfusion (before the cartridge becomes saturated). As the extraction ratio only reflects the percent removal of drug presented to the dialysis membrane or hemoperfusion cartridge; these techniques remove only a small fraction of body load of drugs with large stores. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-poisoning\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Theophylline poisoning&quot;</a>.)</p><p>High extraction ratios and clearance rates, however, do not necessarily predict improved clinical outcomes. No controlled clinical studies in poisoned patients have been performed to determine if hemoperfusion reduces morbidity or mortality as compared with supportive measures. Evidence of clinical effectiveness for hemoperfusion is based upon favorable pharmacokinetic data, animal studies, anecdotal case reports, case series, and uncontrolled retrospective studies. Three clinical studies have retrospectively compared hemoperfusion with supportive care for poisoning from a variety of drugs, but do not allow firm conclusions to be drawn regarding the relative efficacy of different management strategies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enhanced-elimination-of-poisons/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When intoxication has occurred with a drug whose HD clearance is significantly greater than endogenous clearance, the use of HD may be necessary if the patient's condition progressively deteriorates, or when measured drug concentrations are predictive of a poor outcome without HD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enhanced-elimination-of-poisons/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Practically, HD is indicated for a limited number of poisonings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F82353\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82353 \">table 4</a>).</p><p>Hemoperfusion may be considered for use in severe poisoning from the toxins listed in the following table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F71695\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71695 \">table 5</a>). It is significantly more effective than HD in enhancing the clearance of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a> but is associated with a higher complication rate and is not available at many medical centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enhanced-elimination-of-poisons/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

Acute vascular access for hemodialysis or hemoperfusion is best accomplished with femoral catheters, which can be rapidly and safely inserted. Subclavian catheterization can also be used; however, there is a risk of pneumothorax or hemothorax, and therapy may be delayed because of the necessity for radiographic confirmation of proper catheter placement. The duration of these procedures for poisoned patients is usually four to eight hours but should be governed by the clinical response and serum drug concentrations.

Hemofiltration has been used to enhance elimination of aminoglycosides, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a>, and metal chelate complexes, but the technique does not remove highly protein-bound drugs effectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enhanced-elimination-of-poisons/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. It may also be of benefit for intoxications with drugs that have a large volume of distribution, tight tissue binding, or slow intercompartmental transfer (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procainamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">procainamide</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enhanced-elimination-of-poisons/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

Blood that enters the hemofiltration circuit passes through filters (sheet membrane or hollow fiber) with large pores, and an ultrafiltrate forms which drags solutes with molecular weights up to 50,000 daltons (depending upon hemofilter pore size). Cells and solutes larger than the pore size remain in the blood and return to the circulation.</p><p>In contrast to HD or hemoperfusion, CAVH is driven by the patient's own blood pressure and can be run continuously. The rate of fluid removal, which is equivalent to the plasma clearance of drug, can exceed 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/h;</span> thus, fluid replacement is an essential component of the hemofiltration regimen.</p><p>Complications of hemofiltration include clotting of the filter and bleeding due to the requisite use of heparin.

Exchange transfusions are rarely indicated but may be useful in the treatment of massive hemolysis (eg, due to arsine or sodium chlorate poisoning), severe methemoglobinemia, severe sulfhemoglobinemia (eg, secondary to hydrogen sulfide exposure), or neonatal drug toxicity. Complications of the technique include transfusion reactions, ionized hypocalcemia, and hypothermia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enhanced-elimination-of-poisons/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

However, the severity of the ingestion and pharmacologic properties of the toxin may prompt consideration of techniques to enhance elimination of the poison in a small percentage of cases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Few studies have assessed changes in clinical outcomes when enhanced elimination techniques are employed, and the efficacy of these techniques has been judged primarily on the basis of improvement in elimination kinetics. Each technique is associated with potential complications, and the decision to use a particular technique should be based upon the drug ingested, the actual and predicted severity of poisoning, the presence of contraindications to the technique, and the effectiveness of alternative methods of treatment. In general, the decision to employ enhanced elimination techniques is reserved for patients with severe poisoning who have failed to respond to aggressive supportive care.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Despite these concerns, the following general recommendations can be offered:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Multiple dose activated charcoal may be useful following specific ingestions.
