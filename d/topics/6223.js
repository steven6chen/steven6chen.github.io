The timing of the infection reflects different pathogenic mechanisms that, in turn, influence the epidemiology, microbiology, pathology, and clinical manifestations of the infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Early infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Microorganisms can reach the valve prosthesis by direct contamination intraoperatively or via hematogenous spread during the initial days and weeks after surgery. The organisms have direct access to the prosthesis-annulus interface and to perivalvular tissue along suture pathways because the valve sewing ring, cardiac annulus, and anchoring sutures are not endothelialized early after valve implantation. These structures are coated with host proteins, such as fibronectin and fibrinogen, to which some organisms can adhere and initiate infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Late infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As the sewing ring, sutures, and adjacent tissues become endothelialized over the months following valve replacement, sites for adherence of microorganisms and access to host tissues adjacent to the prosthesis are altered. The pathogenesis of late PVE has been postulated to resemble native valve endocarditis (NVE). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-vegetation-formation-in-infective-endocarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of vegetation formation in infective endocarditis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Platelet-fibrin thrombi probably form on the prosthesis and serve as sites for the organisms to adhere and cause infection. Thus, the pathogens producing PVE later in the time course tend to be bacteremic isolates with the ability to adhere to these thrombi and are similar to organisms inducing NVE. Unless the infecting organism is <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> or another highly virulent or invasive pathogen, the perivalvular tissues are less likely to be affected in late PVE since endothelialization limits access to these tissues. Later-onset infections tend to be less invasive, are less often complicated by perivalvular abscess formation and valve dehiscence, and are more commonly restricted to the sewing ring or the bioprosthetic leaflet.</p><p>The leaflets of porcine bioprosthetic valves experience age-related alterations in their surface characteristics. These aging leaflets become sites for platelet-fibrin thrombus deposition and subsequent infection. As a result, the infection rates on bioprostheses increase during this later period when compared with mechanical valves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].

As with NVE, they are due largely to the confounding effect of recent or concurrent antibiotic therapy. Nevertheless, the agents causing culture-negative endocarditis can also cause PVE. Two organisms are unique associated with blood culture-negative PVE:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><em>Coxiella burnetii</em>, an unusual cause of endocarditis, has a unique predisposition to cause PVE. Therefore, in areas where this pathogen is endemic, it must be considered a potential cause of late-onset culture-negative PVE. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=q-fever-endocarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Q fever endocarditis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Late PVE due to <em>Mycobacterium chimaera</em> has been described in association with airborne transmission from contaminated heater-cooler unit water tanks during open cardiac surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. Some of these cases have presented clinically at long intervals after valve implantation.

In contrast, those cases presenting more than 12 months after valve surgery are usually caused by the same pathogens that produce native valve endocarditis (NVE) in patients who are not injection drug users, since late PVE, like NVE, usually results from transient bacteremia occurring among ambulatory patients (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-risk-factors-and-microbiology-of-infective-endocarditis#H875653\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, risk factors, and microbiology of infective endocarditis&quot;, section on 'Microbiology'</a>). Cases that present after 2 months and before 12 months post surgery are a blend of delayed-onset nosocomial and community-acquired infections; this is reflected in the spectrum of organisms encountered in these cases.</p><p>The coagulase-negative staphylococci causing PVE during the initial year after surgery are almost exclusively <em>Staphylococcus epidermidis</em>. Between 84 and 87 percent of these organisms are methicillin resistant and thus resistant to all of the beta-lactam antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/3,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,30</a>], with the likely exception of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftaroline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftaroline</a> (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methicillin-resistant-staphylococcus-aureus-mrsa-in-adults-treatment-of-skin-and-soft-tissue-infections#H1544552072\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in adults: Treatment of skin and soft tissue infections&quot;, section on 'Ceftaroline (and ceftobiprole)'</a>). By contrast, almost half of the coagulase-negative staphylococci causing PVE one year or more after surgery are non-epidermidis species, and only 22 to 30 percent are methicillin resistant.

This makes detection of methicillin resistance among coagulase-negative staphylococci more difficult. As a result, before embarking upon therapy with a beta-lactam antibiotic, the microbiology laboratory must be asked to thoroughly exclude possible methicillin resistance. If this cannot be done, methicillin resistance should be assumed.

Perivalvular invasion, commonly with associated dehiscence of the prosthesis and a paravalvular regurgitant flow, occurs in approximately 40 percent of patients and frank extension into tissue causing myocardial abscess is seen in 15 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].

Large vegetations may prevent closure of the prosthesis producing incompetence or encroach upon the valve orifice causing functional stenosis.</p><p>Bioprosthetic valve endocarditis also is associated with invasive infection. As an example, annular and myocardial invasion was noted in 38 of 85 patients (45 percent) in one study and was more frequent among bioprosthetic PVE occurring in the first year after valve replacement than cases presenting later (59 versus 25 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].

As bioprosthetic valves degenerate, they may form noninfective, calcific, vegetative-like lesions and inflammatory infiltrates, thus potentially causing a noninfectious process to be misdiagnosed as PVE. A retrospective pathologic analysis of inflamed bioprosthetic valve tissue from 88 patients who underwent surgical removal of a bioprosthetic valve (21 for suspected endocarditis and 67 for noninfective dysfunction) was conducted to better define the histologic criteria for PVE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Histologically, PVE was characterized by microorganisms, vegetations, and neutrophil-rich inflammatory infiltrates. In contrast, inflammatory infiltrates in valve tissue samples from the noninfective control group consisted mainly of macrophages and lymphocytes.

In the absence of prior antibiotic therapy, blood cultures will be positive in 90 percent or more of patients with PVE. Because bacteremia is continuous, cultures will be positive regardless of whether or not blood cultures are obtained in proximity to the fever. When blood cultures are drawn over a period of hours to days in a patient with a prosthetic valve and all or most are positive, PVE is highly probable. The duration of documented bacteremia is particularly important when the isolate is a common contaminant, such as coagulase-negative staphylococci or diphtheroids. A high rate of blood culture positivity, or molecular evidence that a sporadically isolated organism represents a single clone, helps to distinguish infecting pathogens from contaminants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>If antibiotics have not been administered prior to obtaining blood cultures, it is unusual to have persistently negative blood cultures in patients with clinically overt PVE.

PVE can arise early or late after surgery. The timing of the infection reflects different pathogenic mechanisms that, in turn, influence the pathology, epidemiology, microbiology, and clinical manifestations of the infection. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Microorganisms can reach the valve prosthesis by direct contamination intraoperatively or via hematogenous spread during the initial days and weeks after surgery. These pathogens have direct access to the prosthesis-annulus interface and to perivalvular tissue along suture pathways because the valve sewing ring, cardiac annulus, and anchoring sutures are not endothelialized early after valve implantation. These structures are coated with host proteins, such as fibronectin and fibrinogen, to which some organisms can adhere and initiate infection. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Early infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As the sewing ring, sutures, and adjacent tissues become endothelialized over the months after valve replacement, sites for adherence of microorganisms and access to host tissues adjacent to the prosthesis are altered. The pathogenesis of late PVE has been postulated to resemble native valve endocarditis (NVE). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Late infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk of PVE is greatest during the initial three months after surgery, remains high through the sixth month, and then falls gradually with an annual rate of approximately 0.4 percent from 12 months postoperatively onward for the life of the valve recipient. The percentage of patients developing PVE during the initial year after valve replacement ranges from 1 to 3 percent in studies with active follow-up; by five years, the cumulative percentage ranges from 3 to 6 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F80033\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80033 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The microbiology of PVE is relatively predictable depending on the time since valve implantation:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The most frequently encountered pathogens in early PVE (within two months of valve implantation) are <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> and coagulase-negative staphylococci; next in frequency are gram-negative bacilli and fungal infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The most frequently encountered pathogens in intermediate PVE (2 to 12 months after valve implantation) and late PVE (more than 12 months after valve implantation) are streptococci, <em>S aureus</em> coagulase-negative staphylococci, and enterococci. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Blood culture&ndash;negative PVE can occur in any period after valve implantation and largely results from the confounding effect of recent antibiotic therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The high frequency of invasive infection associated with PVE results in higher rates of new or changing murmurs, heart failure, and new electrocardiographic conduction disturbances compared with NVE. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Pathology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the absence of prior antibiotic therapy, blood cultures will be positive in 90 percent or more of patients with PVE. When blood cultures are drawn over a period of hours to days in a patient with a prosthetic valve and all or most are positive, PVE is highly probable. The duration of documented bacteremia is particularly important when the isolate is a common contaminant, such as coagulase-negative staphylococci or diphtheroids. A high rate of blood culture positivity, or molecular evidence that a sporadically isolated organism represents a single clone, helps to distinguish infecting pathogens from contaminants. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Blood cultures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) has greatly improved the diagnosis and management of PVE and is considered the procedure of choice if only one type of echocardiogram is to be obtained. Although transthoracic echocardiogram (TTE) and TEE are complementary in the diagnosis of PVE, TEE has a sensitivity of 86 to 92 percent compared with 17 to 36 percent for TTE. TEE is also superior to TTE in the detection of abscesses, fistulae, and paraprosthetic leaks.
