In a multicenter, randomized trial that included 55 patients aged 4 to 26 years with peanut allergy confirmed by double blind placebo-controlled food challenge (DBPCFC), 79 percent of those receiving maintenance oral immunotherapy (OIT) passed a DBPCFC (minimal to no symptoms), compared with only 19 percent of those receiving placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-allergy-and-immunology/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The remaining 21 percent in the peanut OIT group withdrew due to adverse events, primarily gastrointestinal symptoms. Although OIT remains investigational, this trial suggests that desensitization to peanut at a level sufficient to prevent reactions to small accidental exposures is possible in both children and young adults.

In one trial, 48 children aged 4 to 15 years with two to five food allergies were randomly assigned to pretreatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omalizumab</a> (anti-IgE) or placebo, followed by rush multifood OIT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/whats-new-in-allergy-and-immunology/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Compared with OIT alone, pretreatment with omalizumab resulted in a higher rate of desensitization to at least two offending foods and a lower rate of adverse events. These results suggest that the addition of anti-IgE to multifood OIT improves both efficacy and safety, but further trials are needed to clarify which patients would benefit most from this approach.
