It can affect both the large and small intestines, is often progressive, and may lead to a variety of clinical consequences depending upon the extent of the injury. It usually develops three or more months after radiation therapy. Chronic radiation enteritis is due to an obliterative arteritis that leads to intestinal ischemia, which can result in stricture, ulceration, fibrosis, and occasionally fistula formation. The physiologic consequences can include altered intestinal transit, reduced bile acid absorption, increased intestinal permeability, bacterial overgrowth, and lactose malabsorption. Clinical manifestations include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, weight loss, malnutrition, and bleeding (usually in patients with colonic involvement).</p><p>This topic review will focus on the diagnosis and management of chronic radiation injury to the small intestine and proximal colon. The pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and risk factors for chronic radiation enteritis and other radiation-related gastrointestinal toxicities are discussed separately.

This may help to determine which intestinal segments may have received excessive radiation exposure, which can then be correlated with the radiologic findings and the clinical presentation. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, we begin evaluation with an abdominal computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) enterography and an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy.

Histologic findings of radiation enteritis include diffuse collagen deposition with mucosal and serosal thickening, inflammatory cell infiltrates, vascular sclerosis, and occlusive vasculitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H650632424\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">CT/MR</span> enterography findings include segmental inflammation. These include bowel thickening, mucosal hyperenhancement, mesenteric stranding, and luminal stricturing. In the later stages, stenotic segments and ultimate small bowel obstruction can occur as a result of fibrosis. </p><p><span class=\"nowrap\">CT/MR</span> enteroclysis is an alternative to enterography in patients who cannot tolerate oral contrast. Enteroclysis involves installation of contrast into the intestine using a nasoenteric tube. Vomiting, which is sometimes associated with enterography, is avoided in enteroclysis by control of infusion rates fluoroscopically. For identifying low-grade or intermittent obstruction, CT enteroclysis has a reported sensitivity and specificity of approximately 88 and 82 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-chronic-radiation-enteritis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Studies suggest the results are comparable to and possibly more sensitive than CT enteroclysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-chronic-radiation-enteritis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, only small numbers of patients have been studied, and the technique is not yet widely available. Upper gastrointestinal series with small bowel follow-through, although useful for evaluating the extent of disease, are not as sensitive as enteroclysis or enterography and are therefore rarely performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-chronic-radiation-enteritis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H773974577\"><span class=\"h2\">Additional evaluation</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Breath test for small intestinal bacterial overgrowth</strong> &ndash; Specific testing for bacterial overgrowth is preferable to empiric therapy in patients with unexplained diarrhea, abdominal pain, or bloating. A major drawback to empiric therapy is that treatment may require more than one antibiotic and repeated and sometimes cyclic treatment. Because antibiotics may be associated with adverse effects, some of which may mimic symptoms of bacterial overgrowth (such as diarrhea and abdominal discomfort), establishing a firm diagnosis is important. This can usually be accomplished with a breath test. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Capsule endoscopy</strong> &ndash; There is little published experience with capsule endoscopy specifically for diagnosing radiation enteritis, although there is some clinical experience (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F75475\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75475 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F53206\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53206 \">picture 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-chronic-radiation-enteritis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Capsule endoscopy should not be performed in patients with evidence of an intestinal stricture on <span class=\"nowrap\">CT/MR</span> enterography. A patency capsule should be considered prior to capsule endoscopy in order to exclude subtle, yet important, luminal narrowing(s) in which a video capsule may become lodged.

In patients with diarrhea, this consists of dietary modification and, based on the severity of diarrhea, antidiarrheal agents and bile acid-binding resins. Patients with diarrhea, bloating, and abdominal pain who have evidence of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth should be treated with antibiotics.</p><p>Patients with intermittent obstructive symptoms should be advised a low-residue diet. Surgery in patients with chronic radiation enteritis should be performed selectively and only for persistent bowel obstruction, fistula, or gastrointestinal bleeding that fails to resolve with medical management.

However, patients should be instructed to avoid foods that are high in fiber, such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. A high-fiber diet may worsen diarrhea and urgency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-chronic-radiation-enteritis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Patients with lactose intolerance should be advised to restrict but not eliminate dietary lactose. Some patients who develop lactose intolerance due to bacterial overgrowth may improve following antibiotic treatment.

Loperamide was associated with a significant reduction in the frequency of bowel movements, slower intestinal transit, and improvement in the absorption of bile acids.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4187610923\"><span class=\"h3\">Bile acid sequestrants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with persistent diarrhea despite antidiarrheals, we use bile acid sequestrants (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cholestyramine-resin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cholestyramine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colestipol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colestipol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=colesevelam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">colesevelam</a>). However, their use is limited by associated gastrointestinal side effects including bloating, flatulence, abdominal discomfort, and constipation. The rationale for the use of bile acid sequestrants is that the prevalence of bile salt malabsorption is estimated to be as high as 50 percent in patients with a history of pelvic radiotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-chronic-radiation-enteritis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Antibiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antibiotics can reduce symptoms in patients with evidence of small intestinal bacterial overgrowth.

Furthermore, it can be difficult to distinguish healthy tissue from irradiated tissue by gross inspection alone; intraoperative endoscopy may be helpful in this setting, but experienced is limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-management-of-chronic-radiation-enteritis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extensive resection may be required, potentially leading to short bowel syndrome.
