Radionuclide MPI requires the administration of a radioactive perfusion tracer (also called a radiopharmaceutical or radioisotope), usually intravenously, and a special camera system, single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), or positron emission tomography (PET), to detect the gamma photons. Myocardial perfusion images are usually acquired at rest and following stress, with increasing adoption of stress-only imaging, and many available combinations of one- versus two-day rest-first versus stress-first protocols, as discussed below. A specialized computer program reconstructs the acquired images into standard displays (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F99934\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef99934 \">image 1</a>).</p><p>Radionuclide MPI provides important information on rest and post-stress myocardial perfusion, viability, and global and regional left ventricular systolic function, which generally signify the presence and extent of underlying coronary artery disease. In addition, rMPI is a powerful tool for risk stratification of patients with known or suspected coronary artery disease.</p><p>Resting rMPI provides information on the presence or absence of myocardial infarction and viability. To detect the presence and extent of stress-induced myocardial ischemia, a radioisotope must also be administered under conditions of stress, and rest and stress images can then be compared. Stress testing in conjunction with rMPI is accomplished using either exercise (treadmill or bicycle), pharmacologic agents (preferably vasodilators, but if contraindicated, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a>), or a combination of both vasodilator stress and low-level exercise.</p><p>An overview of the indications, contraindications, techniques, and safety of stress rMPI will be provided here (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F71371\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71371 \">table 1</a>).

The inability to perform an exercise test is in itself a marker of increased risk in patients referred for rMPI and those with coronary heart disease (CHD).

Any of the protocols may be used in conjunction with rMPI. The radioisotope should be injected as close to peak exercise as possible, and then exercise should be continued for at least one more minute to allow the radioisotope to circulate before termination of exercise. The exercise test should be interpreted as detailed elsewhere and included in the final rMPI report. Depending on the SPECT radioisotope, image acquisition may begin almost immediately following termination of exercise, or it may be delayed up to several hours after exercise.

In a study of 49 patients (24 female, ages 41 to 69) with a normal exercise stress test and low probability for CHD who underwent <span class=\"nowrap\">rest/dipyridamole</span> stress Rb-82 PET imaging, absolute myocardial blood flow increased from rest to stress and was higher in women than in men, with some variations depending on the software package used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-radionuclide-myocardial-perfusion-imaging/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

Blood flow in normal coronary arteries may increase up to fourfold in response to coronary vasodilation. In the presence of a moderate to severe coronary artery stenosis, the increase in blood flow with vasodilator stress is attenuated, leading to reduced coronary flow reserve in the area subtended by the coronary artery stenosis, and an associated relative reduction in radiotracer uptake. Because of this relative difference in radiotracer uptake, the area supplied by the stenotic coronary artery appears as a perfusion defect when the left ventricular myocardium is normalized to the most normal area with the highest radiotracer uptake.

Two-day protocols generally use the same dose of radiopharmaceutical for the rest and stress images, which may be performed in any order, though a stress-first or stress-only protocol may be desirable in patients more likely to have a normal scan, in which case the resting scan may not be required. (See <a href=\"#H2521817390\" class=\"local\">'Single-isotope, stress-only protocol'</a> below.)</p><p>The two-day Tc99m-based protocol is useful in larger patients in whom low-dose radiotracer administration may be associated with suboptimal image quality, particularly if acquired with older conventional SPECT systems.

In this protocol, the second radiopharmaceutical dose is generally three times higher than the rest radiopharmaceutical dose, thereby offsetting the first dose of myocardial radioactivity. With Tc99m-based radiopharmaceuticals, image acquisition should be performed 15 to 60 minutes after radiopharmaceutical injection, depending on whether the acquisition is post-exercise, post-pharmacologic stress, or at rest, but it may be delayed out to two hours post-injection since no clinically significant redistribution occurs with these radiopharmaceuticals. The estimated total body radiation dose of a typical one-day <span class=\"nowrap\">rest/stress</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">stress/rest</span> Tc99m-based protocol using conventional SPECT imaging is approximately 11 milliSieverts. This may be substantially reduced by using weight-based radiopharmaceutical activity and newer solid-state camera systems.</p><p>Several Tl-201 protocols are available but are less commonly utilized than Tc99m-based protocols due to the higher patient radiation exposure. Unlike Tc99m-based protocols, the stress test and stress Tl-201 injection must be performed first. Because clinically significant redistribution of Tl-201 may occur shortly after radiotracer administration, Tl-201 stress image acquisition should be performed generally within 10 minutes following Tl-201 injection. However, if the patient is still breathing hard from the exercise test, imaging should be delayed slightly due to possibility of myocardial creep (artifact from upward movement of the diaphragm from changes in respiratory rate) post-exercise. In patients who achieve stage III or higher on the Bruce protocol, imaging should not start earlier than 15 minutes post-stress, and respiratory rate should be &lt;25 respirations per minute at the start of imaging to reduce upward creep of the diaphragm. At 2.5 to 4 hours following the initial stress Tl-201 injection, the initial Tl-201 redistribution image may be acquired with or without further Tl-201 reinjection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-radionuclide-myocardial-perfusion-imaging/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. If the initial redistribution image demonstrates a residual defect (or defects), delayed (18 to 24 hours after initial Tl-201 injection) images may be obtained to assess for further redistribution and myocardial viability following a small dose of Tl-201 administration. A rest-only thallium may also be performed for myocardial viability assessment; the protocol begins with an initial rest image, followed by an initial redistribution image, and if necessary, a delayed image.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2521817390\"><span class=\"h4\">Single-isotope, stress-only protocol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A Tc99m-based stress-only protocol is increasingly adopted by laboratories to reduce radiation exposure and resource utilization. In this protocol, the stress test and stress image acquisition with electrocardiography (ECG)-gating <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> attenuation correction is performed and interpreted in a timely manner. If the stress image is completely normal, the resting image is not required and the study is completed in a shorter time frame and with lower patient radiation exposure than most conventional paired rest and stress Tc99m protocols. However, if the stress image is abnormal, the resting image may be required and generally needs to be delayed until the following day when higher-dose resting studies may be accomplished. The key to successful implementation of stress-only protocols is careful patient selection, and we typically screen patients for the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior abnormal rMPI images</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Known severe CHD or myocardial infarction without prior revascularization</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Known cardiomyopathy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight &gt;300 lbs</p><p/><p>If any of the above <span class=\"nowrap\">is/are</span> present, the patient should generally undergo a full <span class=\"nowrap\">rest/stress</span> Tc99m study as the stress image is more likely to be abnormal or equivocal. Exercise alone or combined with vasodilator stress may be preferred over pharmacologic stress due to the superior image quality associated with the former compared with the latter. Prediction models to identify patients suitable for stress-first imaging may be useful guides to appropriately select patients for this protocol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-radionuclide-myocardial-perfusion-imaging/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H268623459\"><span class=\"h4\">Dual isotope</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Utilization of a dual-isotope protocol is generally not recommended due to the higher radiation exposure associated with the dual isotope approach. In this protocol, 3 mCi of 201-Tl is injected at rest, and images are then acquired within 10 minutes. Subsequently, the stress study is performed using a Tc99m-based radiopharmaceutical. The main advantage of this approach is patient throughput since Tl-201 images can be acquired almost immediately following the rest injection; however, the dual-isotope protocol generally only reduces patient time in the laboratory by approximately 30 minutes and is offset by several disadvantages, including the highest patient radiation exposure among all rMPI protocols and the difficulties of interpreting rest and stress images of different resolutions, with the associated challenge of assessing for transient ischemic cavity dilation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2521817514\"><span class=\"h2\">PET imaging</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2521817426\"><span class=\"h3\">PET isotopes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The only FDA-approved PET perfusion tracers are rubidium-82 and 13N-ammonia. 13N-Ammonia use is restricted to centers with an available on-site or nearby cyclotron due to the short physical half-life of 13N of 9.9 minutes. Rubidium-82 is produced from a strontium-82 generator and is widely used in centers without on-site cyclotrons but generally requires a rapid delivery system due to the very short physical half-life of 75 seconds. The same dose of these PET perfusion tracers is usually administered for both the rest and stress, usually in this order. 13N-ammonia requires a 50-minute period between rest and stress radiotracer administration for decay of the rest radiotracer dose. In addition to image acquisition following tracer administration (termed emission image), PET imaging requires an additional image acquisition using an external radiation source (termed transmission image) using either CT in <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> systems, or rod or line sources in dedicated PET systems. Each transmission image is then used for attenuation correction of each emission image. With PET MPI, vasodilator stress is highly preferred because exercise, although feasible, poses technical challenges during PET perfusion imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-radionuclide-myocardial-perfusion-imaging/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Dobutamine</a> is an alternative when vasodilators are contraindicated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2521817636\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiation exposure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The American Society of Nuclear Cardiology (ASNC) and the American Heart Association (AHA) have published recommendations for reducing radiation exposure in MPI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-radionuclide-myocardial-perfusion-imaging/abstract/66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67</a>]. The range of radiation exposure varies significantly depending on the study performed and the camera system used, with many newer systems generally requiring lower activity, resulting in lower doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-radionuclide-myocardial-perfusion-imaging/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rest-stress PET rMPI using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrogen-13-ammonia-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">N-13 ammonia</a> &ndash; approximately 2 milliSieverts</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rest-stress PET rMPI using rubidium-82 &ndash; approximately 3 milliSieverts</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stress-only SPECT rMPI using 99m-technetium &ndash; approximately 3 milliSieverts</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rest-stress SPECT rMPI using 99m-technetium &ndash; approximately 11 milliSieverts </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dual-isotope SPECT rMPI using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thallium-201-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">thallium-201</a> &ndash; approximately 22 milliSieverts</p><p/><p>ASNC recommends using PET MPI, if PET is available, as one of the first-line strategies for reducing patient radiation exposure in rMPI (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52470\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef52470 \">algorithm 2</a>), due to the short physical half-lives of the PET perfusion tracers, which lead to lower patient radiation exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-radionuclide-myocardial-perfusion-imaging/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. Another important strategy is the use of newer solid-state SPECT systems <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> novel software, which allow lower doses of radiotracers to be utilized. Stress-only or stress-first protocols should also be considered in eligible patients for radiation reduction purposes. We also recommend reserving Tl-201 protocols for radionuclide assessment of myocardial viability, when PET is not available. ASNC also recommends reserving the dual-isotope protocol, which has the highest patient radiation exposure, only for when myocardial viability is an overriding clinical consideration in patients with advanced CHD, when there is substantially impaired left ventricular systolic function, and when PET is not available. The AHA also recommends alternatives to tests involving radiation (eg, exercise ECG, stress echocardiography, cardiac MRI) in premenopausal women when the alternative test would be appropriate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-stress-radionuclide-myocardial-perfusion-imaging/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Other strategies for reducing patient radiation exposure include ensuring appropriateness and clinical need for the study, considering alternative modalities with comparable diagnostic accuracy without radiation in younger patients, and avoiding layered or serial testing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging (rMPI) enables evaluation of cardiac perfusion and function at rest and during dynamic exercise or pharmacologic stress for the diagnosis and management of patients with known or suspected coronary heart disease (CHD). Stress rMPI is used primarily to detect the presence and extent of CHD by provoking regional ischemia with variable perfusion as well as detecting regions of infarction with decreased resting perfusion. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar to other modalities of stress testing (eg, exercise treadmill testing without imaging, stress echocardiography, etc), the majority of stress rMPI studies are performed to evaluate for known or suspected CHD. The two main reasons for performing stress imaging (either stress rMPI or stress echocardiography) instead of an exercise electrocardiography (ECG) are ECG abnormalities at rest which render the stress ECG nondiagnostic for ischemia or the inability to exercise or exercise adequately. (See <a href=\"#H88555656\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercise stress is preferred over pharmacologic stress for patients who can perform an exercise test. Exercise rMPI is most commonly performed using a treadmill protocol, with rMPI images both at rest and following peak exercise. Pharmacologic stress is employed in patients who are unable to perform exercise testing. (See <a href=\"#H88555968\" class=\"local\">'Exercise rMPI'</a> above and <a href=\"#H88556782\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacologic rMPI'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vasodilator stress rMPI with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenosine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adenosine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dipyridamole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dipyridamole</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=regadenoson-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">regadenoson</a> represents the preferred choice of pharmacologic stress and should be combined with exercise whenever possible. Adenosine, dipyridamole, and regadenoson produce coronary vasodilation and, in the presence of significant coronary stenosis, they induce heterogeneous myocardial blood flow due to differences in coronary flow reserve. The heterogeneity of myocardial blood flow during hyperemia is detectable with a perfusion tracer and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET) imaging. (See <a href=\"#H88559879\" class=\"local\">'Vasodilator rMPI'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Dobutamine</a> stress rMPI is another option for pharmacologic stress testing in patients who are unable to exercise and in whom vasodilators are contraindicated. By increasing both inotropy and chronotropy, dobutamine raises myocardial oxygen demand to a similar level as is seen following exercise. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Atropine</a> may be added to dobutamine when target heart rate (THR) is not achieved at the peak dose of dobutamine.

Clinically important adverse events are uncommon with all of the vasodilators and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a>, although some side effects (eg, flushing, headache, dyspnea) occur fairly frequently. (See <a href=\"#H88557285\" class=\"local\">'Safety and comparison of vasodilators'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Single-isotope <span class=\"nowrap\">rest/stress</span> protocols using Tc99m-based radiopharmaceuticals are the most commonly performed SPECT MPI studies, although stress-only protocols are becoming more common in appropriately selected patients. (See <a href=\"#H2521817365\" class=\"local\">'SPECT protocols'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PET rMPI, if available, has the added benefits of reducing patient radiation exposure due to the short physical half-lives of the PET perfusion tracers and of absolute quantification of myocardial blood flow. PET rMPI appears to have higher diagnostic accuracy than SPECT MPI, but literature is more limited for PET than for SPECT. The availability of PET rMPI is somewhat limited by the short physical half-lives of the available radioisotopes and PET scanner availability for cardiac imaging.
