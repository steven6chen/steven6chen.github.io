Thus, it is not uncommon for patients with active or recent URI to present for elective or emergency surgery. An acute viral URI may result in a variety of signs and symptoms, including sneezing, nasal congestion and discharge (rhinorrhea), sore throat, cough, low-grade fever, headache, and malaise (ie, the &quot;common cold&quot;), as well as sinusitis or simple bronchitis. Implications for patients undergoing general anesthesia depend on the anatomical involvement of the infection, patient comorbidities, and the planned surgical procedure or intervention.</p><p>This topic will discuss anesthetic risks for adult patients with acute or recent URI, as well as management to prevent perioperative complications. Anesthetic management of children with acute or recent URI is addressed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-the-child-with-a-recent-upper-respiratory-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for the child with a recent upper respiratory infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>General principles for diagnosis and treatment of URI or acute bronchitis in adults are discussed separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-common-cold-in-adults-diagnosis-and-clinical-features\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The common cold in adults: Diagnosis and clinical features&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-common-cold-in-adults-treatment-and-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The common cold in adults: Treatment and prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-bronchitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute bronchitis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2326389723\"><span class=\"h1\">RISKS OF GENERAL ANESTHESIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of studies addressing anesthetic management in patients with a URI have included only children, due to a higher incidence of respiratory complications in the pediatric population compared with adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-adults-with-upper-respiratory-infection/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Although data guiding anesthetic management of adults with a URI are sparse, decisions are individualized to balance risks and benefits of proceeding with general anesthesia or another anesthetic technique against potential risks of postponing the procedure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3596572216\"><span class=\"h2\">Upper airway effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Similar to pediatric patients, the major risks for adult patients with acute or recent URI are due to upper airway hyperreactivity, particularly development of laryngospasm during induction or emergence from general anesthesia. However, laryngospasm may occur at any time during the procedure if a supraglottic airway (SGA) device, such as a laryngeal mask airway, is selected. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-the-child-with-a-recent-upper-respiratory-infection#H1413148270\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for the child with a recent upper respiratory infection&quot;, section on 'Risks of anesthesia for the child with an upper respiratory infection'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1025990486\"><span class=\"h2\">Lower airway effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A URI also increases bronchial hyperreactivity due to increased vagal tone and decreased function of inhibitory M2 muscarinic receptors on lower airway parasympathetic nerve endings. These effects potentiate reflex bronchoconstriction and airway hyperresponsiveness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-adults-with-upper-respiratory-infection/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. For these reasons, monitoring for clinical signs and symptoms of bronchoconstriction should continue throughout the procedure and in the early postoperative period.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2260630426\"><span class=\"h1\">PREANESTHETIC EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preoperative anesthetic assessment and planning differ for elective versus <span class=\"nowrap\">urgent/emergency</span> surgery in a patient with acute or recent URI.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3407709863\"><span class=\"h2\">Elective surgery</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1867253281\"><span class=\"h3\">Preoperative assessment</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History &ndash; The history should include the onset and any current symptoms suggestive of URI, as well as the presence of pulmonary comorbidities such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical examination &ndash; Patients are examined for obvious signs of a URI such as nasal discharge, repeated coughing, a sick appearance, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fever. Assessment of the upper airway for evidence of inflamed laryngeal mucosa or pronounced tonsillar enlargement is particularly important. Also, the chest should be auscultated for wheezing, crackles, rhonchi, or pulmonary rales as possible signs of lower respiratory infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory and radiological examination &ndash; If an infection such as pneumonia or sinusitis is suspected, a complete blood cell count (CBC) with differential is obtained to exclude systemic involvement. Although not routinely performed, a rapid viral test may be obtained to confirm viral etiology (eg, during seasonal influenza epidemics). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A preoperative chest radiograph (CXR) is unnecessary in the majority of surgical patients, including those with a recent URI (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-preoperative-pulmonary-risk#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of preoperative pulmonary risk&quot;, section on 'Chest radiographs'</a>). However, we would obtain a CXR in patients with chronic lung disease and a new exacerbation of respiratory symptoms or new lung auscultation findings to rule out active pulmonary infection <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> heart failure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-patients-with-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease#H643896351\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&quot;, section on 'Chest radiograph'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3522264221\"><span class=\"h3\">Timing of elective procedures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Timing of anesthesia and elective surgery depends on the acuity of the URI, the persistence and severity of symptoms, any exacerbation of chronic symptoms in a patient with respiratory disease, as well as the risks of delaying the planned procedure. </p><p/><p>In otherwise healthy adult patients with acute symptomatic URI or any evidence of systemic involvement, we postpone most surgical procedures until one to two weeks after symptoms subside. For patients with recent URI who are currently asymptomatic, we do not usually postpone a procedure. However, we recognize that airway hyperreactivity may last for two to six weeks after a URI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-adults-with-upper-respiratory-infection/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Similarly, in adult asthmatic patients with acute URI, we postpone an elective surgical procedure until one to two weeks after symptoms subside. Perioperative bronchospasm or laryngospasm is uncommon in patients with well-controlled asthma, even after recent URI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-adults-with-upper-respiratory-infection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, the effects of general anesthesia in patients with a URI combined with asthma have not been described. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-adult-patients-with-asthma#H435169636\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for adult patients with asthma&quot;, section on 'Recent upper respiratory infection'</a>.)</p><p>For patients with moderate or severe COPD, elective surgery is postponed if there are any signs and symptoms of acute URI and treatment is initiated (eg, inhaled bronchodilators, systemic glucocorticoid therapy, antibiotics if indicated). Timing for return to baseline after a COPD exacerbation is variable; thus, duration of postponement is individualized. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-patients-with-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease#H396784837\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&quot;, section on 'History and physical examination'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-patients-with-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease#H396784969\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&quot;, section on 'Preoperative interventions for optimizing pulmonary function'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4171503927\"><span class=\"h2\">Urgent or emergency surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urgent or emergency surgical procedures may be necessary in adult patients with acute URI. Except in truly life-threatening emergencies, there is usually time to conduct a basic upper and lower airway evaluation, and to administer an inhaled bronchodilator in a patient with wheezing due to URI <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a history of asthma or COPD.

However, patient- or procedure-specific factors may necessitate securing the airway. In such cases, airway management considerations in adults with a URI are similar to those in adults with asthma.

Recruitment maneuvers are performed only when indicated to improve oxygenation (eg, obese patients; during open abdominal surgery; and before, during, and after insufflation for laparoscopy and thoracoscopy), and in specific circumstances (eg, after disconnect from the ventilator for suctioning). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanical-ventilation-during-anesthesia-in-adults#H3186383247\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanical ventilation during anesthesia in adults&quot;, section on 'Lung protective ventilation during anesthesia'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H547028579\"><span class=\"h3\">Emergence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Emergence should be planned to avoid airway irritation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ventilator dyssynchrony. Laryngospasm, coughing and &quot;bucking&quot; on the ETT, or bronchospasm may occur prior to extubation, as the patient transitions through Stage II anesthetic depth to an awake state. Reflex airway reactions to the noxious stimulus of the ETT or airway suctioning may be attenuated by allowing spontaneous ventilation or by administering a small dose of intravenous opioid (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a> 50 mcg).

Laryngospasm is almost exclusively an intraoperative event and rarely occurs once the patient completely regains consciousness. However, oxygen desaturation, bronchospasm, and cough can occur in the recovery room and later in the postoperative course.
