Kidney failure, also called &quot;end-stage renal disease,&quot; is when the kidneys stop working completely.</p><p>If the kidneys stop working completely, people can choose between 3 different treatments to take over the job of the kidneys.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15947842\"><span class=\"h1\">What are my choices for renal replacement therapy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can choose between:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kidney transplant &ndash; A kidney transplant is surgery in which a doctor puts a healthy kidney in a person whose kidneys are diseased (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F59957\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59957 \">figure 2</a>). The healthy new kidney can then do the job of the diseased kidneys. (People need only 1 kidney to live).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A new kidney can come from a living donor (usually a family member or friend) or a dead donor. After a kidney transplant, people need to take medicines for the rest of their life to keep their body from reacting badly to the new kidney.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">More information about a kidney transplant can be found in other articles. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=planning-for-a-kidney-transplant-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">&quot;Patient education: Planning for a kidney transplant (The Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=kidney-transplant-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">&quot;Patient education: Kidney transplant (The Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peritoneal dialysis &ndash; Peritoneal dialysis is a procedure that people do at home every day. It involves piping a special fluid into the belly. This fluid collects waste and excess salt and water from the blood. Then, the used fluid drains out of the belly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F71539\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71539 \">figure 3</a>). Before people can have peritoneal dialysis, they need surgery to have a tube put in their belly. The tube allows the fluid to get in and out of the belly.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">More information about peritoneal dialysis can be found in another article. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peritoneal-dialysis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">&quot;Patient education: Peritoneal dialysis (The Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemodialysis &ndash; Hemodialysis is a procedure in which a dialysis machine takes over the job of the kidneys. The machine pumps blood out of the body, filters it, and returns it to the body (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F56992\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56992 \">figure 4</a>). Before people can have hemodialysis, they need surgery to create an &quot;access.&quot; An access is a way for the blood to leave and return to the body.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">People have hemodialysis at least 3 times a week. Most people can choose between having hemodialysis at a dialysis center (in a hospital or clinic) or at home.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">More information about hemodialysis can be found in other articles. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preparing-for-hemodialysis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">&quot;Patient education: Preparing for hemodialysis (The Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemodialysis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">&quot;Patient education: Hemodialysis (The Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15947857\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the benefits and downsides of the different treatments?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following table lists the benefits and downsides of a kidney transplant, peritoneal dialysis, and hemodialysis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F75453\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75453 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15947872\"><span class=\"h1\">How do I choose between the different treatment options?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You, your doctor, and your family will need to work together to find the treatment that's right for you. It will depend partly on your condition, overall health, and home situation. Your doctor can explain all of your options.</p><p>People usually benefit most from a kidney transplant. But a new kidney is not always available. Plus, not everyone who wants a kidney transplant can get one. People need to meet certain conditions to be able to get a kidney transplant.</p><p>When thinking about your choices, you should also know that:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you are on a list to get a kidney from a dead donor, you might need to wait a long time. You will most likely need to start peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis while you wait.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you start one type of dialysis and it doesn't work for you, you can switch to the other type of dialysis.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15947887\"><span class=\"h1\">Can I choose not to have any of these treatments?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes, you can choose not to have any renal replacement therapy. People usually live for days to a few months without treatment, depending on their kidneys, symptoms, and overall health.</p><p>If you don't have renal replacement therapy, waste will build up in your blood. This can make you feel tired, itchy, or sick to your stomach. Fluid will also build up in your body. This can cause swelling and trouble breathing. During this time, your doctor will give you medicines to treat your symptoms and make you more comfortable.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15947902\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=kidney-transplant-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Kidney transplant (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=planning-for-a-kidney-transplant-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Planning for a kidney transplant (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=peritoneal-dialysis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Peritoneal dialysis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=preparing-for-hemodialysis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Preparing for hemodialysis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemodialysis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hemodialysis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dialysis-and-diet-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Dialysis and diet (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-kidney-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chronic kidney disease (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dialysis-or-kidney-transplantation-which-is-right-for-me-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Dialysis or kidney transplantation &mdash; which is right for me?
