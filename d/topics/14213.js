The term AKI has largely replaced acute renal failure (ARF), as it more clearly defines renal dysfunction as a continuum rather than a discrete finding of failed kidney function. Pediatric AKI presents with a wide range of clinical manifestations from a minimal elevation in serum creatinine to anuric renal failure, arises from multiple causes, and occurs in a variety of clinical settings.</p><p>The prevention, management, and outcomes of AKI in children are presented in this topic review. The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of AKI in children, and the approach to AKI in newborns are presented separately.

It has been proposed that the ensuing decrease in energy requirement may be protective of renal tubule cells, which may be faced with a decrease in energy delivery due to renal hypoperfusion or injury. However, the available evidence does not support the routine use of diuretics as a preventive measure for AKI, and in some settings, diuretic use was associated with an increase in serum creatinine. In a retrospective analysis of 914 children admitted to a pediatric intensive care unit (PICU), furosemide was the most commonly administered nephrotoxic agents and its use was associated with a two-fold greater risk of developing AKI after adjusting for other factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Accurate initial assessment is required to determine if the child is hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic, and guides initial fluid management. Subsequent fluid therapy is based on careful follow-up with accurate records of fluid input and output, body weights, physical examinations (eg, blood pressure and pulse), and additional invasive monitoring as needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H535581842\"><span class=\"h3\">Hypovolemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A child with a clinical history and physical exam consistent with hypovolemia requires emergent intravenous (IV) fluid therapy given as a normal saline bolus (10 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> over 30 minutes, repeated twice as needed) in an attempt to restore renal function and prevent the progression of prerenal AKI to intrinsic AKI. If urine output does not increase and renal function fails to improve with the restoration of intravascular volume (ie, no decrease in serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen), bladder catheterization is recommended to confirm anuria. At this point, other forms of invasive monitoring, such as measuring central venous pressure, may be required to adequately assess the child&rsquo;s fluid status and help guide further therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H535581850\"><span class=\"h3\">Euvolemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In euvolemic children, ongoing fluid losses (insensible fluid [300 to 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/m<sup>2</sup></span> per day], urine, and gastrointestinal losses) should be balanced by administered fluids including medications and nutrition.

However, loop diuretic therapy does not significantly alter the natural course of AKI. The dissociation between increasing the urine output and not affecting the course of AKI with diuretic therapy probably reflects the ability of the diuretic to enhance the urine output in those few nephrons that are still functioning. However, there is no effect on nonfunctioning nephrons, and as a result, there is no effect on the course of the renal failure.

Furosemide should be promptly discontinued if the bolus doses do not result in a diuretic response within two hours of bolus administration. The risk of ototoxicity and renal toxicity from furosemide use in this setting is significant due to potential elevated serum levels.

Hyperventilation by the patient resulting in respiratory alkalosis may provide some correction of the acidosis but aggressive mechanical ventilation should be avoided, as hyperventilation results in compromise to cerebral blood flow with the potential for ischemia resulting in worse outcomes.

Several contributing factors may cause an elevation in blood pressure including fluid overload and renin-mediated hypertension, often seen in children with glomerulonephritis. Initial management is typically administration of a diuretic. Subsequent management is determined by the severity of hypertension, cause of hypertension, and response to initial therapy (such as diuretics).

Adequate nutrition includes normal maintenance requirements and supplemental calories to address the catabolic needs of the patient. However, the optimal nutritional requirements and nutrient intake composition in AKI remain uncertain, and are based largely on expert opinion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Nutrient needs of patients with AKI are highly heterogeneous, depending on etiology, catabolic rate, acute and chronic comorbidities, and RRT modalities. No validated guidelines for the nutritional management of the critically-ill child with AKI are currently available. It has been suggested that a caloric intake of approximately 30 percent above the maintenance requirements should provide adequate calories in most children with AKI without a substantial risk of overfeeding. Thus, infants should receive at least 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">Kcal/kg</span> per day, and in older children, nutritional intake should be at least 150 percent of maintenance needs. Tight glucose control is recommended, especially since hyperglycemia and insulin resistance are common in critically-ill children and associated with AKI and longer length of PICU stays [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>In critically-ill children, AKI is associated with abnormal amino acid synthesis and increased protein catabolism. In addition, renal replacement therapy results in amino acid losses, which often leads to negative nitrogen balance when a standard intake of 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> of protein is provided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure-in-children/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Therefore, it has been recommended that daily protein intake should be increased to a minimum of 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> per day in critically-ill children with AKI, and additional amino acid supplementation (approximately 20 percent) should be given to children on hemodialysis or continuous renal replacement therapy to compensate for amino acid loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure-in-children/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Some experts suggest that protein intake should be targeted to maintain blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at the 40 to 80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> range as an indication of positive nitrogen balance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure-in-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>If feasible, the enteral route is preferred over the parenteral route for nutritional support. Enteral feeding promotes gut mucosal integrity, restores immune responses, prevents gut atrophy, reduces the risk of nosocomial infection, and is more cost-effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure-in-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-parenteral-nutrition-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Total parenteral nutrition</a> (TPN) should be considered only if enteral feeding cannot be established after five to seven days in the PICU or if the child is severely malnourished. In a multicenter randomized trial involving 1440 critically-ill children, patients in whom TPN was withheld for one week versus those who received earlier TPN had lower rates of infection and RRT, and shorter durations of mechanical ventilation, and PICU and hospital stay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prevention-and-management-of-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure-in-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. If adequate protein and calorie nutrition cannot be achieved because of fluid restriction, RRT should be instituted early in the course of the illness.

The next step is to review the patient&rsquo;s medication list to determine if dosing adjustments are warranted based on the estimated GFR. Dose reductions are generally necessary for renally excreted drugs when GFR falls below 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. Medication dosing should be revisited regularly throughout the child&rsquo;s illness and readjustments should be made as warranted if renal function improves or declines. In addition, drug levels should be routinely monitored for medications for which therapeutic monitoring is available (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">vancomycin</a>, aminoglycosides, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enoxaparin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">enoxaparin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">digoxin</a>).
