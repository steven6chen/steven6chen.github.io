However, some women prefer to initiate pharmacologic therapy sooner and we do so without extensive evaluation or invasive testing if the symptoms are clearly and predominantly urgency-related.

In one multicenter randomized controlled trial, addition of a behavioral training and exercise program (eg, training and practicing pelvic floor muscle exercises and adaptive response to a sensation of urgency) to anticholinergic therapy was not shown to improve the ability to discontinue medications at 10 weeks; however, combination therapy did have a beneficial effect on patient satisfaction, self-reported improvement, and reduction of other bladder symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-urgency-incontinence-overactive-bladder-in-women/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3964900742\"><span class=\"h1\">EXERCISES, LIFESTYLE AND CONSERVATIVE THERAPIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The same conservative therapies that are applied to other types of urinary incontinence are applicable to urgency <span class=\"nowrap\">incontinence/overactive</span> bladder (OAB), including modifying contributory medical (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F101070\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101070 \">table 1</a>) and lifestyle (eg, obesity) factors, initiating pelvic floor (Kegel) exercises (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-floor-muscle-exercises-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Pelvic floor muscle exercises (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>) and bladder training (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F71150\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71150 \">table 2</a>), and treating vaginal atrophy (if present) with topical estrogen therapy (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-genitourinary-syndrome-of-menopause-vulvovaginal-atrophy#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of genitourinary syndrome of menopause (vulvovaginal atrophy)&quot;, section on 'Vaginal estrogen therapy'</a>).

The choice of initial agent depends upon side effect profile and also on insurance coverage, which may guide a patient toward a generic antimuscarinic as initial therapy. Antimuscarinic agents are an appropriate pharmacotherapy for most women with urgency incontinence. Another option, beta-adrenergic therapy (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mirabegron-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mirabegron</a>), can be used as initial therapy and as an alternative for women who cannot tolerate or do not have sufficient improvement on antimuscarinics. Some women benefit from a combination of an antimuscarinic and mirabegron [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-urgency-incontinence-overactive-bladder-in-women/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2398772505\"><span class=\"h2\">Antimuscarinics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Generally, antimuscarinics are the most commonly prescribed medication, and some insurance plans require an initial trial of antimuscarinics prior to covering other medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-urgency-incontinence-overactive-bladder-in-women/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

In our practice, we consider a PVR <span class=\"nowrap\">&gt;1/3</span> of the total voided volume to be abnormal (eg, 150 mL residual after a void of 300 mL); however, it is reasonable to continue therapy unless voiding difficulty, urinary infection, or worsening OAB occurs.

Because efficacy across the various formulations is similar, selection of the appropriate drug for an individual patient is primarily dictated by side effect profile, tolerability, medical comorbidities, or insurance coverage.

The procedure includes a test phase and a second-stage implantation phase. The test phase can be done with temporary percutaneous leads, usually placed bilaterally in the outpatient clinic setting. However, due to high rates of migration of the percutaneous wires and failed test phases with this technique, we prefer a staged approach, performed in a surgical setting, in which a permanent lead wire is placed into one S3 foramen (or rarely, both) and tunneled under the skin to connect to a temporary stimulation device. In both settings, patients are asked to maintain voiding diaries to document their urinary urgency, frequency, and leakage severity at baseline for three days prior to the test phase and then daily during the two-week testing period. If greater than 50 percent improvement in any of these parameters is confirmed, the patient can elect permanent implantation with a pacemaker-like stimulator placed under the skin of the upper buttock.
