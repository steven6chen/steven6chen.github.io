Normal parathyroid anatomy is reviewed elsewhere (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-anatomy-of-the-parathyroid-glands\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical anatomy of the parathyroid glands&quot;</a>).

The choice further depends upon whether the patient has a compelling reason to avoid the possibility of a neck reoperation.</p><p>Total parathyroidectomy without autotransplantation should be avoided in this setting because it is associated with the highest risk of postoperative permanent hypocalcemia, which is more difficult to treat once the patient is no longer dialysis dependent after renal transplantation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2813041412\"><span class=\"h4\">Patients without contraindications to reoperative neck surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For most patients who have no contraindications to reoperative neck surgery, we typically perform a sub- or near-total parathyroidectomy rather than a total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation. </p><p>A sub- or near-total parathyroidectomy has a lower risk of postoperative permanent hypocalcemia because the remnant is attached to its original blood supply. Compared with an autograft supplied only by neovascularization, an anatomic parathyroid remnant is more resilient to ischemia and less likely to fail.

Examples of such reasons include thyroid conditions that potentially require additional surgical procedures, prior history of repeated neck surgery, known recurrent laryngeal nerve injury, significant medical comorbidities, or intolerance of general anesthesia.</p><p>Total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation negates the risk of a major neck reoperation by relocating the surviving parathyroid remnant to a site where recurrent hyperparathyroidism (HPT) may be detected and treated more conveniently. However, there is an increased risk of temporary and permanent hypocalcemia.

In addition, patients who have calciphylaxis should also undergo total parathyroidectomy without autotransplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroidectomy-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. Calciphylaxis is a serious disorder that most commonly occurs in ESRD patients. It is characterized by calcification of dermal arterioles and classically presents with skin ischemia and necrosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calciphylaxis-calcific-uremic-arteriolopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Calciphylaxis (calcific uremic arteriolopathy)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients excluded from renal transplantation require continued dialysis, which exposes them to a high risk of developing recurrent HPT. Total parathyroidectomy without autotransplantation is the most effective surgical treatment for severe refractory HPT in this group of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroidectomy-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

The choice of techniques is dictated by whether the patient is a candidate for a renal transplant as detailed above (see <a href=\"#H3048786118\" class=\"local\">'Choosing a surgical technique'</a> above). Whenever feasible, a thymectomy and parathyroid tissue cryopreservation should be performed with the primary procedure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30749482\"><span class=\"h2\">General principles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For ESRD patients with four enlarged glands, parathyroid surgery should be conducted in an orderly sequence as detailed below. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3254532318\"><span class=\"h3\">Four-gland exploration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>First, all parathyroid glands should be exposed after a thorough bilateral neck exploration via a transverse cervical incision.

Marking the remnant with a titanium clip facilitates its localization in the event of a reoperation. Alternatively, the remnant can be marked with a long permanent suture buried just below the strap muscles, to be traced back to the remnant during a reoperation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1714844237\"><span class=\"h3\">Search for the missing gland(s)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, identification of fewer than four parathyroid glands in ESRD patients should prompt a search for the missing gland(s). The search should follow an organized and deliberate sequence, including searching the retroesophageal and deep paratracheal spaces, the carotid artery and jugular venous sheaths, potential intrathyroidal locations, and the thymus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroidectomy-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/16,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,23</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=parathyroid-exploration-for-primary-hyperparathyroidism#H1352796\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Parathyroid exploration for primary hyperparathyroidism&quot;, section on 'Missing gland'</a>.)</p><p>Intrathyroidal parathyroid glands in ESRD patients can be sizeable and mimic thyroid nodules. If a thyroid nodule is suspected to be of parathyroid origin, parathyroid hormone (PTH) measurement of fluid obtained from the nodule by needle aspiration may be confirmatory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroidectomy-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4264387098\"><span class=\"h3\">Cervical thymectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If an inferior parathyroid gland is missing, it is most likely located in one of the intrathymic locations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroidectomy-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Thymectomy is an important component of parathyroid surgery for ESRD patients who have missing inferior parathyroid glands because retained intrathymic glands can be the source of persistent or recurrent disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroidectomy-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In one study, adding a cervical thymectomy increased the overall cure rate of HPT from 89 to 94 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroidectomy-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. </p><p>Cervical thymectomy must be performed with care. Many ESRD patients have friable cervical tissues <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> atrophic thymus. In addition, if a parathyroid remnant is inferiorly based, it is susceptible to devascularization by a cervical thymectomy performed in its vicinity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2325999813\"><span class=\"h3\">Resect abnormal glands with intraoperative PTH monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite a thorough search for the missing glands, some patients may only have two or three identifiable abnormal parathyroid glands. Intraoperative PTH monitoring may aid in the management of such patients. </p><p>Intraoperative PTH monitoring helps to guide the surgical decision-making process. In patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, established protocols (eg, the Miami protocol for primary HPT) provide assurance that all hyperfunctioning parathyroid tissue has been removed before surgery is concluded. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intraoperative-parathyroid-hormone-assays#H32846719\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intraoperative parathyroid hormone assays&quot;, section on 'Intraoperative PTH monitoring protocols'</a>.)</p><p>However, an established intraoperative PTH monitoring protocol does not exist for ESRD-related HPT, and protocols validated in other patient populations do not apply to ESRD patients because of delayed renal clearance of PTH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroidectomy-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/50-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-53</a>]. In one study, the half-life of PTH was 6.6 minutes in ESRD patients, compared with 2.2 minutes in patients with normal renal function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroidectomy-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. </p><p>Nevertheless, intraoperative PTH monitoring is used in parathyroid surgery for ESRD patients. Typically, the PTH value measured after excision is completed is compared with the baseline value. In one study, a decline of 80 percent predicted cure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroidectomy-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Conversely, a postresection PTH level that is high or fails to decrease suggests the presence of additional abnormal glands and mandates further exploration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroidectomy-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/5,50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,50,51</a>]. Additionally, the laterality of a missing gland can also be determined by comparing the PTH levels of blood samples obtained from bilateral jugular veins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroidectomy-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/55-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">55-58</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2372341997\"><span class=\"h3\">Cryopreservation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Even with careful surgery, a small percentage of patients may develop postoperative hypoparathyroidism due to either ischemic necrosis of the parathyroid remnant or early failure of an autograft. Permanent hypoparathyroidism could potentially be prevented if there is cryopreservation of parathyroid tissue at the time of the original surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroidectomy-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=parathyroid-surgery-for-inherited-syndromes#H22965911\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Parathyroid surgery for inherited syndromes&quot;, section on 'Cryopreservation'</a>.)</p><p>Our technique of preparing parathyroid tissue for cryopreservation is illustrated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F107531\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef107531 \">picture 1</a>). However, fewer than 30 percent of surgeons have access to a facility that allows cryopreservation of parathyroid tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroidectomy-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. In the absence of cryopreservation, the surgeon must carefully calibrate the size of the parathyroid remnant or autograft to avoid permanent hypoparathyroidism. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30749489\"><span class=\"h2\">Subtotal parathyroidectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The basic concept of this operation is to remove nearly all abnormal parathyroid glands, leaving only a well-vascularized remnant of one gland in its anatomic location. Thus, in patients with four abnormal parathyroid glands, three are completely removed, and the fourth one is crafted into the parathyroid remnant. Near-total parathyroidectomy leaves a smaller remnant than subtotal parathyroidectomy. (See <a href=\"#H2923052153\" class=\"local\">'Create a parathyroid remnant'</a> above.)</p><p>Subtotal parathyroidectomy is associated with a low rate of postoperative permanent hypocalcemia but a risk of potentially having to reoperate in the neck when recurrent HPT develops, reportedly in 5 to 30 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroidectomy-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/32,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,45</a>]. The risk of reoperative neck surgery can be reduced but not eliminated by performing a near-total parathyroidectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroidectomy-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2813041412\" class=\"local\">'Patients without contraindications to reoperative neck surgery'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2458327\"><span class=\"h3\">Creating a parathyroid remnant</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The volume of the only remaining gland is reduced to create the parathyroid remnant. Experienced surgeons can estimate the weight of a parathyroid gland in situ prior to resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroidectomy-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The weight in milligrams is approximately the same as the volume in cubic millimeters calculated as an ellipsoid (eg, a 8 x 4 x 4 mm fragment is 64 mg) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F107528\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef107528 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroidectomy-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/5,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,18,19</a>]. </p><p>In general, the aim is to leave approximately 50 to 100 mg of residual parathyroid tissue, equivalent to the size of two normal parathyroid glands. Remnants as small as 50 mg can be created if more extensive (eg, near-total) parathyroid excision is desired. A larger remnant (eg, &gt;100 mg) may be used to avoid postoperative hypocalcemia in patients who are noncompliant with medications or are expected to have severe postoperative bone hunger but is associated with a greater risk of disease recurrence. </p><p>Most abnormal parathyroid glands in ESRD patients weigh between 500 and 1000 mg, larger than those in patients with any other types of HPT. Thus, the traditional subtotal, or <span class=\"nowrap\">&quot;3+1/2</span> gland&quot; parathyroidectomy, which leaves 50 percent of an abnormal parathyroid gland as the remnant, may not be appropriate for ESRD patients.</p><p>A 75 percent resection of the remnant gland (near-total parathyroidectomy) has been used for ESRD patients. A more aggressive resection can be attempted when parathyroid cryopreservation is available; when cryopreservation is not available, accurate assessment of remnant size is crucial to avoid postoperative permanent hypocalcemia. </p><p>The parathyroid remnant should be created from a gland that is most readily accessible (eg, inferior glands) should a reoperation be needed. In addition, glands with well-defined vascular pedicles are preferred as remnants over those with globular or calcified features. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30749496\"><span class=\"h2\">Total parathyroidectomy with heterotopic autotransplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This procedure removes all cervical parathyroid glands that can be identified and simultaneously autotransplants a small portion of a gland to a new, nonanatomic site. </p><p>Although some have suggested a lower rate of recurrence after total, rather than subtotal, parathyroidectomy, the observed incidence of recurrence is still quite high (17 percent at 10 years after surgery), especially in cases of prolonged patient survival with long-term dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroidectomy-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. However, autograft recurrences are easier to treat than neck recurrences.

Permanent hypoparathyroidism can be countered by autotransplantation of cryopreserved parathyroid tissue (where available) at a later date, although the ideal shelf life of cryopreserved tissue is limited to under two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroidectomy-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>].

Variations of this technique have been described, including inserting each piece into an individual pocket, inserting several pieces into a pocket, or injecting a suspension of fragments into a muscle with a syringe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroidectomy-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12708812\"><span class=\"h3\">Autograft sites</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of different sites have been utilized to host autotransplanted parathyroid tissue, including neck, chest, and forearm. The nondominant forearm is our preferred site of parathyroid autotransplantation. At each site, autografts can be placed either intramuscularly or subcutaneously. </p><p>In general, subcutaneous implantation and explantation of parathyroid autografts are simpler to perform than intramuscular procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroidectomy-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. Subcutaneous implantation also permits a more radical excision than intramuscular implantation in case of a recurrent hyperparathyroidism. In one study, intramuscular autografts were more likely to require removal than subcutaneous autografts (23 versus 2 percent), but subcutaneous autografts were removed sooner after than intramuscular autografts (3.3 versus 6.6 years after implantation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroidectomy-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>Regardless of implantation sites, parathyroid fragments are sturdy and can survive in any tissue environment. Furthermore, they are small and can migrate or disperse in unpredictable directions such that resection of all foci can be challenging regardless of where the autograft is originally placed. As an example, local problems, such as parathyromatosis, have been found to complicate intramuscular implantation and subsequent resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroidectomy-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12708831\"><span class=\"h4\">Forearm</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The nondominant forearm is our preferred site of parathyroid autotransplantation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F107532\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef107532 \">picture 2</a>). The advantage of implanting parathyroid tissue into the nondominant forearm is that re-exploration, if needed for recurrent HPT, can be easily carried out under local anesthesia. Forearm autotransplantation also provides the ability to determine if an autograft is functional by comparing PTH levels of blood samples drawn from the antecubital vein of the implanted arm versus the contralateral arm.</p><p>In ESRD patients who may require parathyroid autotransplantation to the forearm, it is important to identify the nondominant arm preoperatively and to protect any present or potential future sites of dialysis access (ie, arteriovenous fistula or graft) in that forearm.

It is widely practiced in countries such as Japan. </p><p>In a randomized trial of 100 patients who developed (secondary) HPT when on long-term (59&plusmn;37 months) dialysis, total parathyroidectomy with or without autotransplantation resulted in comparable perioperative outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroidectomy-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. At three years, patients who underwent total parathyroidectomy <strong>without</strong> autotransplant had lower PTH levels (31.7&plusmn;43.6 versus 98.2&plusmn;156.8) and lower rates of persistent (1.9 versus 4.1 percent) or recurrent (0 versus 8.3 percent) HPT. Although parathyroid tissue was cryopreserved, no patients in either group required delayed autotransplantation for permanent hypoparathyroidism. Approximately 50 and 85 percent of patients required oral calcium and vitamin D supplementation, respectively. Approximately one-quarter of patients in each group received a renal transplant within the study follow-up period. This trial suggested that total parathyroidectomy without autotransplantation may be as safe and effective for patients with ESRD as total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation.</p><p>In the United States, the preferred surgical treatment of HPT in patients with ESRD depends heavily on whether they are excluded from renal transplant and varies by local practices. Because total parathyroidectomy without autotransplantation has the highest risk of causing permanent hypocalcemia, it should be reserved for patients who suffer from severe complications of HPT due to lifelong dialysis (eg, bone osteodystrophy) and should be performed with parathyroid cryopreservation whenever possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroidectomy-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/61,62,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62,65</a>].

Therefore, prior to a reoperative procedure, the surgeon should examine all available medical records, especially operative and pathology reports, to determine the most likely site(s) of recurrences. Preoperative imaging studies can help localize the recurrences as well. For patients who have previously undergone autotransplantation of parathyroid tissue, all known sites of autografts (eg, forearm) should be included in the field of view of the imaging studies. Vocal cord examination by laryngoscopy or ultrasound is also recommended prior to reoperation to exclude an occult recurrent laryngeal nerve injury from prior surgery. (See <a href=\"#H1290321033\" class=\"local\">'Imaging for parathyroid localization'</a> below.)</p><p>At reoperation, a targeted exploration of the recurrence site(s) guided by preoperative imaging is preferred to blind bilateral neck exploration. For patients with a forearm autograft, it is not unusual to require several reoperations to completely remove autografts from the forearm because of regrowth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroidectomy-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H30749376\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H30749383\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=refractory-hyperparathyroidism-and-indications-for-parathyroidectomy-in-dialysis-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Refractory hyperparathyroidism and indications for parathyroidectomy in dialysis patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients with ESRD have multigland hyperplasia and for initial parathyroid surgery, therefore, require subtotal or total parathyroidectomy after identifying all four glands, rather than targeted parathyroidectomy. (See <a href=\"#H22524990\" class=\"local\">'For the initial parathyroid surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For ESRD patients with an existing or planned renal transplant, we perform either a subtotal parathyroidectomy or a total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation. Total parathyroidectomy without autotransplantation should be avoided in this setting because it is associated with the highest risk of postoperative permanent hypocalcemia, which is difficult to treat once the patient is no longer dialysis dependent after renal transplantation. (See <a href=\"#H2319374743\" class=\"local\">'Patients with existing or planned renal transplant'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">During a subtotal parathyroidectomy, a parathyroid remnant equivalent to the size of two normal parathyroid glands (approximately 50 to 100 mg) should be created from a gland that is most accessible and has the best possible blood supply before the other glands are resected. (See <a href=\"#H30749489\" class=\"local\">'Subtotal parathyroidectomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">During a total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation, the autograft can be placed subcutaneously or intramuscularly in the neck (sternocleidomastoid muscle), chest, or nondominant forearm by surgeon preference. (See <a href=\"#H30749496\" class=\"local\">'Total parathyroidectomy with heterotopic autotransplantation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients excluded from renal transplant, we suggest performing a total parathyroidectomy without autotransplantation rather than the other surgical options (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Total parathyroidectomy without autotransplantation is the most effective surgical treatment for severe refractory hyperparathyroidism, which commonly occurs in this group of patients. (See <a href=\"#H1229732470\" class=\"local\">'Patients excluded from renal transplant'</a> above and <a href=\"#H30749503\" class=\"local\">'Total parathyroidectomy without autotransplantation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For ESRD patients with recurrent hyperparathyroidism, we perform a targeted exploration of recurrent sites (including autograft sites), guided by preoperative imaging studies and intraoperative PTH assays, rather than blind bilateral neck exploration. (See <a href=\"#H17504617\" class=\"local\">'Reoperative parathyroid surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Compared with patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, ESRD patients are more likely to develop transient hypocalcemia after parathyroid surgery due to hungry bone syndrome. Thus, many institutions have protocols in place to administer intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">calcium gluconate</a> along with oral calcium, magnesium, and vitamin D (calcitriol) when necessary. Patients are discharged home on an aggressive regimen of oral calcium and vitamin D replacement. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3538067361\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Dr. Benjamin O Lawson, who contributed significantly to this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/parathyroidectomy-in-end-stage-renal-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Sharma J, Weber C.
