They occur when forces striking the head exceed the mechanical integrity of the calvarium. Significant skull fractures are often accompanied by moderate or severe intracranial injury and extracranial injuries associated with high-energy trauma, such as cervical and other spine fractures and thoracoabdominal injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skull-fractures-in-adults/abstract/2-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-9</a>].</p><p>The epidemiology, mechanisms, clinical presentation, associated complications, and initial management of skull fractures in adults are reviewed here. Skull fractures in children and intracranial injuries are discussed separately.

The parietal bone is most frequently fractured, followed by the temporal, occipital, and frontal bones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skull-fractures-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Linear fractures are the most common, followed by depressed and basilar skull fractures. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Definition and presentation of skull fracture types'</a> below.)</p><p>Much of the data on skull fractures in adults come from studies of traumatic brain injury (TBI). Each year, approximately 2.8 million people sustain head injuries in the United States alone, resulting in 2.5 million undergoing emergency evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skull-fractures-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>According to one retrospective study of 207 head-injured patients, 37 percent of those with associated intracranial pathology sustained a linear skull fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skull-fractures-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. According to another retrospective study of 2254 cases of head trauma from assault, approximately one-third sustained a skull fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skull-fractures-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The most common causes of head injury in adults include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Falls</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assaults</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Motor vehicle collisions</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Penetrating missiles</p><p/><p>Although skull fractures themselves may or may not indicate the presence of significant TBI, certain skull fracture types, such as depressed skull fractures, basilar skull fractures with associated cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) leak, and fractures of the temporal-parietal bone that traverse the middle meningeal artery and vein, are associated with significant morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skull-fractures-in-adults/abstract/2-5,8,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5,8,14,15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY AND MECHANISM OF INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The skull is made up of the frontal, ethmoid, sphenoid, and occipital bones, two parietal bones, and two temporal bones (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F72739\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72739 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82226\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82226 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F60967\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60967 \">figure 3</a>). The unique layered architecture of these bones enhances the skull's strength. Each bone consists of solid inner and outer layers, separated by a layer of cancellous bone (the diplo&euml;). In adults, the bones of the skull average between 2 and 6 mm in thickness; the bones in the temporal region are usually the thinnest and therefore at the greatest risk of fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skull-fractures-in-adults/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p>Patients who sustain a fracture of the temporal bone are at high risk for extra-axial hematoma (ie, bleeding beneath the skull but outside the brain parenchyma). This is due to the temporal bone's relative weakness and the proximity of the middle meningeal artery and vein. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intracranial-epidural-hematoma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intracranial epidural hematoma in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=subdural-hematoma-in-adults-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Subdural hematoma in adults: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Fractures involving the frontal sinus are also considered high risk; they are frequently associated with contusions to the anterior portion of the frontal lobes and with dural tears. The thin cribriform plate is often shattered. Other high risk fractures include those over the transverse or sagittal sinus, due to the increased risk of major bleeding, and basilar skull fractures resulting in CSF otorrhea or rhinorrhea. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Basilar skull fracture'</a> below.)</p><p>Skull fractures occur from direct trauma to the head [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skull-fractures-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The amount and dispersion of the kinetic energy involved primarily determine whether a skull fracture is linear or depressed. The smaller the area receiving the blow and the greater the energy delivered, the more likely that a depressed fracture will result.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PREHOSPITAL MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The priorities of prehospital trauma management remain unchanged in patients with skull fractures. These are discussed in detail separately. Special considerations in the patient with a skull fracture are described below. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prehospital-care-of-the-adult-trauma-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prehospital care of the adult trauma patient&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Prehospital personnel should assume a skull fracture exists in any patient who has sustained a significant head injury or other major trauma. High kinetic energy is needed to cause a skull fracture. Therefore, maintaining immobilization of the cervical and thoracic spine is of great importance.</p><p>Open or closed skull fractures can be associated with large scalp lacerations with profuse bleeding that can be difficult to control. Initial management consists of steady direct pressure at the source of bleeding. A dressing held in place by a circumferential head bandage is often NOT sufficient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial assessment of any trauma patient is focused on the rapid identification and stabilization of life-threatening injuries. Patients with major head trauma may require airway protection. Bleeding from wounds associated with skull fractures can be profuse. Direct pressure is the initial treatment. Occasionally, large scalp lacerations require the placement of Raney Clips, which compress the small blood vessels feeding the lacerated portion of the scalp, thereby preventing bleeding (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F52581\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52581 \">picture 1</a>). Alternatively, large sutures may be placed in the scalp to control bleeding. Commercial hemostatic agents (eg, QuikClot) are becoming more widely available. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fibrin-sealants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fibrin sealants&quot;</a>.)</p><p>After the primary trauma survey is performed and life-threatening issues are addressed, the emergency physician or trauma surgeon performs a secondary survey that may reveal findings suggestive of a skull fracture or intracranial injury. Such findings may include depressed mental status, focal cranial nerve or other neurologic deficits, scalp lacerations or contusions, bony step-off of the skull, or periorbital or retroauricular ecchymosis. Scalp wounds should NOT be probed. When examining potential skull fracture sites, the clinician should take care to avoid injury from bone edges or fragments.</p><p>The blunt force required to cause a skull fracture is substantial. Therefore, it is essential to rule out underlying traumatic brain injury. The emergency department work-up of patients with suspected skull fractures, or deemed to be at significant risk for intracranial injury based upon clinical assessment, is primarily radiographic. Clinical assessment of the patient with a minor head injury, including decision rules for imaging, is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-mild-traumatic-brain-injury-concussion-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute mild traumatic brain injury (concussion) in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Noncontrast computed tomography (CT) scan (including bone windows) is the imaging modality of choice for patients with a suspected skull fracture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F83506\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef83506 \">image 1</a>). Although research on the subject is scant, multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) using thin slices and three dimensional reconstructions appears to enable identification of virtually all clinically significant skull fractures. Tissue windows simultaneously allow for the identification of parenchymal injury (eg, cerebral contusion) as well as other forms of intracranial hemorrhage (eg, subdural hematoma).</p><p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is useful when vascular or ligamentous injury is suspected, but should be considered an ancillary study to CT.</p><p>Little evidence exists to guide the use of CT angiography or other types of angiography in the setting of skull fracture. If MDCT reveals findings suggestive of a basilar skull fracture involving the petrous portion of the temporal bone, it is reasonable to obtain CT angiography to assess for vascular injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skull-fractures-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In one observational study, 13 of 71 patients with a basilar skull fracture sustained a cerebrovascular injury identified by angiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skull-fractures-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. It is generally best to discuss the need for angiography with a radiologist to determine the best approach.</p><p>Skull radiographs are of no benefit if a CT scan is to be performed. If CT is unavailable, skull radiographs using two views should be performed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F83505\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef83505 \">image 2</a>). However, fractures, especially depressed skull fractures, may be difficult to see on plain radiographs. Tangential views of the skull may improve detection. A CT should be obtained if plain radiographs reveal a skull fracture, in order to determine the presence of an intracranial hemorrhage. Although negative plain radiographs in a low risk clinical setting (eg, minor mechanism, normal neurologic examination) are reassuring, they cannot rule out intracranial injury.</p><p>Between 5 to 15 percent of patients with skull fractures also sustain cervical spine fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skull-fractures-in-adults/abstract/5,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,21</a>]. A careful assessment for spinal and other concurrent injuries is essential. The circumstances of the injury and the patient's history and clinical presentation provide the basis for further diagnostic work-up. A toxicologic screen may be useful to assist in the assessment of a patient with altered mental status. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-acute-management-of-cervical-spinal-column-injuries-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and acute management of cervical spinal column injuries in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION AND PRESENTATION OF SKULL FRACTURE TYPES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Skull fractures can be categorized as linear, depressed, or basilar. In open skull fractures, lacerations of the scalp allow direct contact between the environment and the brain parenchyma, thereby increasing the risk of infection. In closed skull fractures, intact scalp tissue provides an effective barrier between the environment and the skull and brain tissue.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Linear skull fracture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A linear skull fracture is a single fracture that most often extends through the entire thickness of the calvarium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F83506\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef83506 \">image 1</a>). They occur most often in the temporoparietal, frontal, and occipital regions.</p><p>The great majority of linear skull fractures have minimal or no clinical significance. However, fractures that cross the middle meningeal groove in the temporal bone or major venous dural sinuses may disturb these vascular structures causing significant extra axial bleeding (ie, bleeding beneath the skull but outside the brain parenchyma). Separation (ie, diastasis) of skull sutures can occur following trauma and most often involves the coronal or lambdoid sutures.</p><p>Adults with simple, closed linear skull fractures usually present without neurologic symptoms. On examination, they may have swelling overlying the fracture site. The minority of patients who develop significant intracranial hemorrhage can present with depressed mental status, headache, vomiting, cranial nerve deficits, or other findings.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Depressed skull fracture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Depressed skull fractures occur when trauma of significant force drives a segment of the skull below the level of the adjacent skull (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51743\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef51743 \">image 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F59474\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef59474 \">image 4</a>). These fractures often involve injury to the brain parenchyma and place patients at significant risk for central nervous system infection, seizures, and death if not identified early and managed appropriately [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skull-fractures-in-adults/abstract/22-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-26</a>]. Mortality appears to be high among patients with depressed fractures who present with a significant decline in mental status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skull-fractures-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. No large prospective epidemiological studies exist to determine the incidence of depressed skull fractures. Of 1075 patients evaluated for head trauma at one major trauma center, 63 were noted to have a depressed skull fracture sustained through a nonpenetrating mechanism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skull-fractures-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Depressed skull fractures may be closed or open. Closed (or simple) depressed fractures exist when no scalp laceration is present over or adjacent to the fracture. Open (or compound) depressed skull fractures exist when a scalp laceration lies over or adjacent to the fracture site. The majority of depressed skull fractures are open, and clinicians should assume that any depressed skull fracture is open until it is proven otherwise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skull-fractures-in-adults/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p>The degree of underlying brain injury determines the clinical presentation of patients with depressed skull fractures. About 25 percent of patients sustain at least a brief loss of consciousness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skull-fractures-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Wounds that may be associated with a depressed skull fracture should be inspected, and the external region around such wounds may be carefully palpated (although the usefulness of palpation is often limited due to swelling). However, the wound itself should NOT be blindly probed.</p><p>The force necessary to create a depressed skull fracture is significant and results from direct trauma from an object, such as a bat or club onto a small area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skull-fractures-in-adults/abstract/10,25,26,30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,25,26,30,31</a>]. Such mechanisms of injury can dislodge bone fragments or result in a portion of the skull becoming lodged beneath another segment. Bone fragments and the edges of depressed skull segments can easily lacerate the adjacent dura mater, creating a portal of entry into the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), thereby increasing the risk of central nervous system (CNS) infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Basilar skull fracture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Basilar skull fractures involve at least one of the five bones that comprise the base of the skull: cribriform plate of the ethmoid bone, orbital plate of the frontal bone, petrous and squamous portion of the temporal bone, and the sphenoid and occipital bones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skull-fractures-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Basilar skull fractures occur most commonly through the temporal bone and thus, are at high risk for extra-axial hematomas, particularly epidural hematomas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F50231\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef50231 \">image 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F71123\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef71123 \">image 6</a>). This is due to the temporal bone's relative weakness and the proximity of the middle meningeal artery and vein.</p><p>Basilar skull fractures can cause a dural tear, creating a communication between the subarachnoid space, the paranasal sinuses, and the middle ear. CSF leaks develop in approximately 11 to 45 percent of basilar skull fractures according to retrospective studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skull-fractures-in-adults/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>]. These leaks can develop within one or up to several days following injury and may manifest as otorrhea or rhinorrhea, which are considered pathognomonic for a basilar skull fracture. Most traumatic CSF leaks resolve spontaneously within seven days, but in rare instances they can persist for as long as several months.</p><p>The degree of underlying brain tissue and cranial nerve injury determines the neurologic presentation. Patients often develop nausea and vomiting due to the proximity of the brainstem centers involved in stimulating nausea and managing vestibular function. Oculomotor deficits from injuries to cranial nerves III, IV, or VI can occur, as may facial nerve palsies or hearing loss from injury to cranial nerves VII and VIII, respectively.</p><p>Clinical signs can often be used to diagnose basilar skull fractures and include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Retroauricular or mastoid ecchymosis (ie, Battle sign) typically appears one to three days after the fracture is sustained (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F69660\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69660 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skull-fractures-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Raccoon eyes&quot; is a common term for periorbital ecchymosis, which suggests a basilar skull fracture or anterior or middle fossa facial trauma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F68268\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68268 \">picture 3</a>). Like Battle sign, raccoon eyes are typically NOT present during the examination immediately following the injury but appear one to three days later.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clear rhinorrhea or otorrhea is found in up to 20 percent of temporal bone fractures. Such leaks may be detected within hours or up to several days after trauma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemotympanum is blood behind the tympanic membrane. It is a common finding in basilar skull fractures that involve the petrous ridge of the temporal bone and generally appears within hours of injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skull-fractures-in-adults/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Hemotympanum is detected by otoscopy, which reveals the blue to purple hue taken on by the tympanic membrane (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F75382\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75382 \">picture 4</a>).</p><p/><p>According to research performed to validate the Canadian Head CT rule, the signs of basilar skull fracture (ie, Battle sign, raccoon eyes, hemotympanum, <span class=\"nowrap\">otorrhea/rhinorrhea)</span> are collectively highly predictive of a clinically important head injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skull-fractures-in-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Smaller observational studies confirm the high predictive value of these findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skull-fractures-in-adults/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>].</p><p>There are reports of tympanic membrane perforation in association with temporal and basilar skull fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skull-fractures-in-adults/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Direct bleeding from the ear&nbsp;may occur in this situation. Any patient who is assessed to be at high risk for a temporal bone or basilar skull fracture and has bleeding from his ear should undergo a computed tomography (CT) scan of the head with thin cuts in the region of the temporal and basilar skull.</p><p>A rare but significant complication of a basilar skull fracture is traumatic carotid cavernous fistula (TCCF). According to a retrospective review, the overall incidence of TCCF in basilar skull fractures is 3.8 percent, with middle fossa basilar skull fractures having the highest association [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skull-fractures-in-adults/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Other examples of uncommon injuries sustained by the carotid artery that may occur following basilar skull fractures, particularly those involving the carotid canal, include thrombosis and dissection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skull-fractures-in-adults/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Penetrating skull fracture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Penetrating injuries of the skull occur as a result of gunshot wounds, stab wounds, and blast injuries. They generally involve significant brain injury and intracranial hemorrhage. Emergency neurosurgical consultation is needed to determine management.</p><p>Tangential skull fractures warrant special mention. They are caused by an impact that occurs at an oblique angle to the skull. In one study, 24 percent of patients with tangential gunshot wounds (GSW) to the head sustained intracranial hemorrhage, while 16 percent had skull fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skull-fractures-in-adults/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Any patient with a tangential GSW to the scalp should undergo CT scanning of the head because of this high association with intracranial injuries.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT OF SPECIFIC INJURIES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Linear fractures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No specific intervention is necessary for linear skull fractures if a noncontrast computed tomography (CT) scan reveals no underlying brain injury. Emergency neurosurgical consultation is obtained for patients with intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) associated with a linear skull fracture.</p><p>Patients are admitted for observation if there is any suspicion or clinical evidence of brain injury. The goal of observation is to detect any worsening of neurologic function as a delayed complication of ICH. Such findings usually appear within 24 hours of injury. Patients with linear skull fractures and evidence of ICH on CT should be observed in facilities with neurosurgery.</p><p>Patients with linear skull fractures but no evidence on CT of ICH should be observed in the emergency department (ED) for four to six hours prior to discharge to detect delayed complications of trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skull-fractures-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. If the patient is neurologically intact and there are no significant extracranial injuries, the patient may then be discharged, provided there is adequate supervision at home for the subsequent 24 hours. Clear discharge instructions must be provided, including instructions to return to the ED immediately should symptoms suggestive of intracranial injury (eg, headache, vomiting, lethargy) develop.</p><p>Adult patients with simple linear skull fractures do not require long term follow-up unless they also demonstrate concussive symptoms or other evidence of mild traumatic brain injury.

Emergency elevation is generally recommended if there is a dural tear, pneumocephalus, an underlying hematoma, or a grossly contaminated wound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skull-fractures-in-adults/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Most skull fractures that are depressed more than 1 cm are managed with early surgery to reduce the risk of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skull-fractures-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Nevertheless, open, depressed skull fractures without evidence of dural penetration or significant complications (eg, intracranial hematoma, severe wound contamination, frontal sinus involvement) on CT may be managed nonoperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skull-fractures-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Uncomplicated, closed, depressed skull fractures may also be managed nonoperatively.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Basilar fractures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intracranial hemorrhage caused by a basilar skull fracture frequently represents a surgical emergency and requires immediate neurosurgical consultation. All patients with basilar skull fractures require admission for observation, regardless of the need for surgical intervention. Clinicians should be suspicious of an epidural&nbsp;hematoma&nbsp;in patients with a temporal bone basilar skull fracture, and close neurologic monitoring is required. An emergency non-contrast CT scan&nbsp;of the head should be obtained for any noticeable change in mental status. </p><p>Basilar skull fractures can produce a dural tear, which can cause a cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) leak. Clinically, this is suggested by the presence of clear or blood-tinged rhinorrhea or otorrhea in a head-injured patient. If the fluid is blood tinged, the &quot;halo&quot; sign (also called the &quot;ring&quot; or &quot;target&quot; sign) may be useful to determine the presence of CSF. To perform the test, a drop of the fluid is placed on a tissue or filter paper. A rapidly expanding ring of clear fluid around red blood defines a positive test. Of note, the halo test does <strong>NOT</strong> differentiate among CSF, saline, saliva, and other clear fluids and has not been formally studied in a clinical setting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-facial-trauma-in-adults#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of facial trauma in adults&quot;, section on 'Examination of specific body parts'</a>.)</p><p>CSF can be distinguished from local nasal secretions more accurately by the presence of beta-trace protein, which is found in high concentrations in CSF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skull-fractures-in-adults/abstract/27,34,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,34,36</a>], or beta-2 transferrin, which is found only in CSF, perilymph, and aqueous humor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skull-fractures-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The availability of both beta-trace proteins and beta-2 transferrin laboratory techniques may be limited in many hospitals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skull-fractures-in-adults/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. </p><p>The majority of CSF leaks resolve spontaneously within one week of injury and without CNS complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skull-fractures-in-adults/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. A systematic review and meta-analysis of five randomized trials and 17 other studies (involving over 2000 patients) of antibiotic prophylaxis following basilar skull fracture concluded that routine prophylaxis is not supported by the available evidence, but noted that this evidence contains methodological shortcomings and is therefore not conclusive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skull-fractures-in-adults/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. We generally do not give prophylactic antibiotics initially for basilar skull fractures. In some cases, prophylaxis may be indicated, but this is best determined in consultation with the neurosurgeon and infectious disease specialist. </p><p>The incidence of bacterial meningitis rises substantially if a leak persists past seven days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skull-fractures-in-adults/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. In such cases, we suggest immediate consultation with neurosurgery to determine the need for expedited repair of the leak. Further, consultation with infectious disease is prudent to determine whether treatment with antibiotics is warranted. When necessary, antibiotic selection is identical to that for penetrating head trauma. Patients with a CSF leak may also require pneumococcal vaccination. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Penetrating injuries'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumococcal-vaccination-in-adults#H3536748441\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pneumococcal vaccination in adults&quot;, section on 'Indications'</a>.)</p><p>Cranial nerve palsies are a delayed complication of basilar skull fractures. They generally present two to three days following injury and are due to nerve compression or contusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skull-fractures-in-adults/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>]. These palsies may respond to treatment with glucocorticoids, although no large clinical trials have been performed to support this approach. Common treatment regimens are similar to those used for nontraumatic palsies (eg, Bell's palsy). We suggest starting such treatment in consultation with otolaryngology or neurosurgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bells-palsy-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bell's palsy: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Facial nerve palsies that appear acutely in association with basilar skull fractures are due to nerve transections. These injuries do NOT respond to glucocorticoid therapy and carry a poor prognosis for recovery of nerve function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skull-fractures-in-adults/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Anticoagulated patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Observational studies of patients taking anticoagulants (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a>) who sustain minor head trauma without a skull fracture suggest such patients are at high risk of intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) and that signs of neurologic deterioration may not appear for up to six hours following injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skull-fractures-in-adults/abstract/52-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-54</a>]. Therefore, patients taking anticoagulants and who sustain head trauma of sufficient force to cause a skull fracture, particularly a basilar skull fracture, are at even greater risk for ICH. Such risk may be greatest among elderly patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skull-fractures-in-adults/abstract/55-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">55-57</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-of-intracerebral-bleeding-in-patients-treated-with-anticoagulants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk of intracerebral bleeding in patients treated with anticoagulants&quot;</a>.)</p><p>We suggest that all patients who are anticoagulated and have sustained a skull fracture be admitted to a facility with neurosurgery for a minimum of 24 hours of observation. Patients should be admitted to a hospital unit capable of performing hourly neurologic reassessments for a minimum of six hours. Thereafter, neurologic reassessment can be performed every two to four hours for the remainder of the observation period. An emergency head CT should be obtained if any sign of neurologic deterioration develops [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skull-fractures-in-adults/abstract/58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Initial evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The blunt force required to cause a skull fracture is substantial. Therefore, it is essential to rule out underlying traumatic brain injury. Multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) using thin slices and three dimensional reconstructions enables identification of clinically significant skull fractures and intracranial hemorrhage. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The great majority of isolated linear skull fractures have no clinical significance. Fractures that cross the middle meningeal groove in the temporal bone or major venous dural sinuses may cause significant extra-axial bleeding. Adults with simple, closed linear skull fractures usually present without neurologic symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Linear skull fracture'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No specific intervention is necessary for linear skull fractures if a noncontrast computed tomography (CT) scan reveals no underlying brain injury. Such patients can be discharged after four to six hours of observation, assuming the absence of neurologic findings and significant noncranial injuries. Emergency neurosurgical consultation is obtained for patients with intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) associated with a linear skull fracture. Patients are admitted for observation if there is any suspicion or clinical evidence of brain injury.

These fractures often involve injury to the brain parenchyma and place patients at significant risk for central nervous system infection, seizures, and death.

(See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Depressed skull fracture'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with depressed skull fractures are admitted to a neurosurgery service. They should receive tetanus prophylaxis as appropriate. We suggest they also be treated with prophylactic antibiotics for five to seven days (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Suggested antibiotics are identical to those used for penetrating head trauma (see <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Penetrating injuries'</a> above).
