It is also referred to as congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI), familial hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia, and primary islet cell hypertrophy (nesidioblastosis). We prefer the term PHHI, as it most accurately describes the clinical manifestation in affected infants and children. The term nesidioblastosis should not be used as it also describes the histology of the newborn pancreas. </p><p>PHHI is a genetic disorder with both familial and sporadic forms, characterized by dysregulation of insulin secretion. Despite its genetic cause, some cases do not present at birth. Early recognition, diagnosis, and treatment are necessary to prevent or minimize neurologic damage from recurrent or prolonged episodes of hypoglycemia. </p><p>PHHI is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-persistent-hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemia-of-infancy/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. The clinical manifestations range from life-threatening hypoglycemia presenting on the first day of life to only mildly symptomatic hypoglycemia in a child or adolescent that may be difficult to identify. The response to medical and surgical therapy also varies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-persistent-hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemia-of-infancy/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>An overview of the pathology, genetics, clinical features, and diagnosis of PHHI will be presented here. The treatment and complications of PHHI and a review on islet cell tumors (insulinomas), which have similar clinical and biochemical features to PHHI, are discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-complications-of-persistent-hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemia-of-infancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and complications of persistent hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia of infancy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Insulinoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of PHHI in individuals of northern European extraction is approximately 1:30,000 live births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-persistent-hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemia-of-infancy/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>]. The incidence is increased in genetically isolated populations with a high prevalence of consanguinity or a founder effect (eg, 1:2675 in Saudi Arabia and 1:3200 in central Finland) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-persistent-hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemia-of-infancy/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When the plasma glucose concentration decreases to below 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (3.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> in children who do not have PHHI, insulin secretion is suppressed. In children who have PHHI, the normal relationship between plasma glucose concentration and insulin secretion is disturbed, so that insulin is inappropriately released even during periods of hypoglycemia. This disturbance of the normal feedback relationship between the plasma glucose concentration and insulin secretion can be caused by a variety of genetic mutations, as discussed below, most commonly by mutations causing abnormal function or regulation of the ATP-dependent potassium (K<sub>ATP</sub>) channel of the pancreatic beta cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F107383\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef107383 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-persistent-hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemia-of-infancy/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>].

Autosomal dominant disease usually is caused by activating mutations in the GCK gene or regulatory mutations in <em>GLUD1</em> gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-persistent-hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemia-of-infancy/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].

In addition, loss of genetic material in the maternal chromosome 11p15 region can cause focal pancreatic lesions. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Paternal uniparental disomy'</a> below.)</p><p>Identification of the genetic subtype of PHHI is helpful because this information can guide clinical management. For example, patients with the most common genetic mutations (<em>ABCC8 </em>and <em>KCNJ11</em> genes) are unlikely to respond to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazoxide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">diazoxide</a> treatment, as compared with those with <em>GLUD1</em>, <em>HNF4A</em>, and <em>HADH</em> mutations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63247\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63247 \">figure 2</a>). In addition, the form of PHHI caused by paternal uniparental disomy (insertion of paternal DNA into the maternal allele in a patient with a specific <em>ABCC8</em><span class=\"nowrap\">/<em>KCNJ11</em></span> mutation) can result in focal rather than diffuse disease. Focal lesions can be surgically resected, which corrects the hypoglycemia. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">KATP channel defects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ATP-sensitive potassium channel (K<sub>ATP</sub> channel) regulates the release of insulin from pancreatic beta cells. It is composed of four regulatory subunits (SUR1, encoded by the <em>ABCC8 </em>gene) and a small subunit (Kir6.2, encoded by the <em>KCNJ11</em> gene) that surrounds a central pore. Inactivating mutations in either of these genes reduce the number of open K<sub>ATP</sub> channels, resulting in depolarization of the beta cells and persistent hypersecretion of insulin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-persistent-hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemia-of-infancy/abstract/10-13,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13,18</a>]. There is some evidence that these mutations also lead to constitutive activation of the mTOR pathway (mammalian target of rapamycin complex), which promotes beta cell proliferation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-persistent-hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemia-of-infancy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. This could explain the diffuse nature of the islet abnormalities in these children.

Alternatively, DNA should be analyzed for a paternally inherited <em>ABCC8</em> or <em>KCNJ11</em> mutation. If a paternal mutation is identified, the clinician should be highly suspicious of a focal lesion in the child and appropriate diagnostic and therapeutic steps taken to optimize the patient's care.

These mutations cause a gain of function in glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of glutamate to alpha-ketoglutarate and ammonia, resulting in increased insulin secretion and hyperammonemia.

The focal form typically responds well to partial pancreatectomy if the lesion(s) can be identified and completely resected, thus sparing pancreatic mass and preserving a functional mass of normal islets. By contrast, diffuse disease requires a near-total pancreatectomy. The distinction between focal and diffuse disease cannot be made on clinical grounds. Focal lesions are too small to be detected by radiographic procedures such as celiac arteriography, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and computed tomography (CT).
