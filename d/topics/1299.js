Symptoms include vaginal discharge, odor, pruritus, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> discomfort. These symptoms are extremely common and frequently lead to self-diagnosis and therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-women-with-symptoms-of-vaginitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In a telephone survey of random women in the United States, 8 percent of Caucasian women and 18 percent of African American women reported an episode of vaginal symptoms of any severity in the previous year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-women-with-symptoms-of-vaginitis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. A healthcare professional was consulted in 55 and 83 percent of cases, respectively, and most women purchased an over-the-counter antifungal preparation to treat their symptoms, whether or not they saw a physician.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H635661\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES OF VAGINITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common infections responsible for vaginal discharge, odor, pruritus, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> discomfort are bacterial vaginosis, <em>Candida </em>vulvovaginitis, and trichomoniasis. These disorders account for over 90 percent of infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-women-with-symptoms-of-vaginitis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bacterial-vaginosis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bacterial vaginosis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=candida-vulvovaginitis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Candida vulvovaginitis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trichomoniasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trichomoniasis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p> However common causes of these symptoms include vaginal <span class=\"nowrap\">atrophy/atrophic</span> vaginitis in postmenopausal women, cervicitis, foreign body, irritants and allergens, and several rarer entities, including some systemic medical disorders. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1860628\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The nonkeratinized stratified squamous epithelium of the vagina in premenopausal women is rich in glycogen. Glycogen from sloughed cells is the substrate for D&ouml;derlein's lactobacilli, which convert glucose into lactic acid, thereby creating an acidic vaginal environment (pH 4.0 to 4.5). This acidity helps maintain the normal vaginal flora and inhibits growth of pathogenic organisms. Disruption of the normal ecosystem can lead to conditions favorable for development of vaginitis. Some of these potentially disruptive factors include phase of the menstrual cycle, sexual activity, contraceptive choice, pregnancy, foreign bodies, estrogen level, sexually transmitted diseases, and use of hygienic products or antibiotics. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H635499\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with vaginitis typically present with one or more of the following vulvovaginal symptoms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Change in the volume, color, or odor of vaginal discharge</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pruritus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Burning</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Irritation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Erythema</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dyspareunia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spotting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dysuria</p><p/><p>Vaginal discharge is a prominent symptom of vaginitis, but may be difficult to distinguish from normal vaginal discharge. In reproductive aged women, normal vaginal discharge consists of 1 to 4 mL fluid (per 24 hours), which is white or transparent, thick or thin, and mostly odorless. This physiologic discharge is formed by mucoid endocervical secretions in combination with sloughing epithelial cells, normal vaginal flora, and vaginal transudate. The discharge may become more noticeable at times (&ldquo;physiological leukorrhea&rdquo;), such as at midmenstrual cycle close to the time of ovulation or during pregnancy or use of estrogen-progestin contraceptives. Diet, sexual activity, medication, and stress can also affect the volume and character of normal vaginal discharge. Although normal discharge may be yellowish, slightly malodorous, and accompanied by mild irritative symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-women-with-symptoms-of-vaginitis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], it is not accompanied by pruritus, pain, burning or significant irritation, erythema, local erosions, or cervical or vaginal friability. The absence of these signs and symptoms helps to distinguish normal vaginal discharge from discharge related to a pathological process, such as vaginitis or cervicitis. (See <a href=\"#H186474307\" class=\"local\">'Management of physiological leukorrhea'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H635637\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laboratory documentation of the etiology of vaginitis is mandatory before initiating therapy, given the nonspecific nature of the symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-women-with-symptoms-of-vaginitis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Diagnostic testing enables targeted treatment, increases therapeutic compliance, and increases the likelihood of partner notification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-women-with-symptoms-of-vaginitis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Empiric therapy based on history and physical examination alone should be avoided because of frequent misdiagnosis and inappropriate therapy. However, 25 to 40 percent of patients with genital symptoms do not have a specific cause identified after initial diagnostic testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-women-with-symptoms-of-vaginitis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. These women tend to have a noninfectious etiology of symptoms.</p><p>The three main steps in the evaluation of women with symptoms of vaginitis are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obtain a history and perform a physical examination. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3894620\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Test for bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and trichomoniasis since these disorders account for over 90 percent of vaginitis in premenopausal women and can be diagnosed by pH testing, microscopy, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> culture (or rapid antigen and nucleic acid amplification tests) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-women-with-symptoms-of-vaginitis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic studies'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If this evaluation does not lead to a diagnosis, then evaluate for less common and rare causes of vaginitis. (See <a href=\"#H12175230\" class=\"local\">'Women without a diagnosis after the initial evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Patients who continue to exhibit symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> have positive tests for sexually transmitted infections after treatment are most likely to have been re-infected by their sexual partner [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-women-with-symptoms-of-vaginitis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>None of the findings from the history allows a definitive diagnosis since there is considerable overlap in symptoms among the different etiologies of vaginitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-women-with-symptoms-of-vaginitis/abstract/4,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8</a>]. Thus, all women with suspected vaginitis should undergo a physical examination and some diagnostic studies. </p><p>The history often suggests a particular diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F81449\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81449 \">table 1</a>), which must be confirmed in the office by examination of vaginal secretions and, if necessary, culture (or rapid antigen and nucleic acid amplification tests). A literature review concluded that the initial office evaluation (history and physical examination; pH, wet mount microscopy, and whiff test of vaginal discharge) correctly diagnosed 60 percent of candidal vulvovaginitis, 70 percent of trichomoniasis, and 90 percent of bacterial vaginosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-women-with-symptoms-of-vaginitis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3894620\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The key questions on history are to determine the patient&rsquo;s symptoms. If discharge is present, what is the quantity, color, consistency, and odor? Is there burning or other discomfort? Vaginal bleeding? Dysuria or dyspareunia?</p><p>The severity of symptoms correlates with the extent of inflammation. <em>Candida</em> vulvovaginitis often presents with marked inflammatory symptoms (pruritus and soreness), but scant discharge (thick, white, odorless, and curd-like). In contrast, bacterial vaginosis is associated with only minimal inflammation and minimal irritative symptoms, but the thin, gray or yellow, malodorous discharge is a prominent complaint. Trichomoniasis is characterized by purulent, malodorous, thin discharge, which may be accompanied by burning, pruritus, dysuria, frequency, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dyspareunia. The vulva is affected by candidiasis and sometimes by trichomoniasis, but not by bacterial vaginosis. Vaginal dryness and dyspareunia are common features of atrophic vaginitis. Symptoms of candidal vulvovaginitis often occur in the premenstrual period, while symptoms of trichomoniasis and bacterial vaginosis often occur during or immediately after the menstrual period.</p><p>However, as discussed above, none of the findings from the history allows a definitive diagnosis since there is considerable overlap in symptoms among the different etiologies of vaginitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-women-with-symptoms-of-vaginitis/abstract/4,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The physical examination is focused upon the degree of vulvovaginal inflammation and the characteristics of the vaginal discharge, as well as the presence of lesions or foreign bodies. Other potentially significant findings include signs of cervical inflammation and pelvic or cervical motion tenderness. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The vulva usually appears normal in bacterial vaginosis, whereas erythema, edema, or fissures suggest candidiasis, trichomoniasis, or dermatitis. Atrophic changes are caused by hypoestrogenemia, and suggest the possibility of atrophic vaginitis. Changes in vulvovaginal architecture (eg, scarring) may be caused by a chronic inflammatory process, such as erosive lichen planus, as well as lichen sclerosus, or mucous membrane pemphigoid, rather than vaginitis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Speculum examination may reveal a lesion. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A foreign body (eg, retained tampon) is easily detected and is often associated with vaginal discharge, intermittent bleeding or spotting, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an unpleasant odor due to inflammation and secondary infection. Removal of the foreign body is generally adequate treatment. Antibiotics are rarely indicated.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Vaginal warts are skin-colored or pink, and range from smooth flattened papules to a verrucous, papilliform appearance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F51759\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51759 \">picture 1</a>). When extensive, they can be associated with vaginal discharge, pruritus, bleeding, burning, tenderness, and pain.

Trichomoniasis is classically associated with a greenish-yellow purulent discharge; candidiasis with a thick, white, adherent, &quot;cottage cheese-like&quot; discharge; and bacterial vaginosis with a thin, homogeneous, &quot;fishy smelling&quot; gray discharge. Inflammation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> necrosis related to malignancy of the lower or upper genital tract can result in watery, mucoid, purulent, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bloody vaginal discharge.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, the appearance of the discharge is unreliable and should never form the basis for diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-women-with-symptoms-of-vaginitis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cervical inflammation with a normal vagina is suggestive of cervicitis, rather than vaginitis. The cervix in women with cervicitis is usually erythematous and friable, with a mucopurulent discharge (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F67848\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67848 \">picture 3</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-cervicitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute cervicitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Cervical erythema in cervicitis should be distinguished from ectropion, which represents the normal physiologic presence of endocervical glandular tissue on the exocervix. Ectropion is more common in women taking estrogen-progestin contraceptives and during pregnancy. Ectropion may increase the volume of normal vaginal discharge.

A pH test stick (or pH paper if available) is applied for a few seconds to the vaginal sidewall (to avoid contamination by blood, semen, or cervical mucus which pool in the posterior fornix and distort results). Alternatively, the vaginal sidewall can be swabbed with a dry swab and then the swab rolled onto pH paper (if available). The pH of the specimen is stable for about two to five minutes at room temperature. The swab should not be pre-moistened, as the moistening liquid can affect pH.</p><p>Narrow range pH paper (4.0 to 5.5) is easier to interpret than broad range paper (4.5 to 7.5). An elevated pH in a premenopausal woman suggests infections such as bacterial vaginosis (pH&gt;4.5) or trichomoniasis (pH 5 to 6), and helps to exclude <em>Candida</em> vulvovaginitis (pH 4 to 4.5). </p><p>The pH of the normal vaginal secretions in premenopausal women is 4.0 to 4.5 because these women have relatively high estrogen levels. Under the influence of estrogen, the normal vaginal epithelium cornifies and produces glycogen, which is the substrate for lactic acid production by lactobacilli. In premenarchal and postmenopausal women in whom estrogen levels are low, the pH of the normal vaginal secretions is &ge;4.7. The higher pH is due to less glycogen in epithelial cells, reduced colonization of lactobacilli, and reduced lactic acid production. Thus measurement of pH for diagnosis of bacterial vaginosis, trichomoniasis, or candidiasis is less useful at the extremes of age. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-genitourinary-syndrome-of-menopause-vulvovaginal-atrophy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of genitourinary syndrome of menopause (vulvovaginal atrophy)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Vaginal pH may be altered (usually to a higher pH) by contamination with lubricating gels, semen, douches, and intravaginal medications. In pregnant women, leakage of amniotic fluid raises vaginal pH. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Microscopy</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H87576964\"><span class=\"h4\">Saline wet mount</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vaginal discharge is generally sampled with a plastic or wood <span class=\"nowrap\">vaginal/cervical</span> scraper or a cotton-tipped swab. The sample of vaginal discharge is mixed with one to two drops of 0.9 percent normal saline solution at room temperature on a glass slide. Cover slips are then placed on the slides, which are examined under a microscope at low and high power. Microscopy should be performed within 10 to 20 minutes of obtaining the sample to reduce the possibility of loss of motility of any trichomonads. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trichomoniasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trichomoniasis&quot;</a>.) &#160;</p><p>Microscopic examination of normal vaginal discharge reveals a predominance of squamous epithelial cells, rare polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs), and <em>Lactobacillus</em> species morphotype (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F68759\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68759 \">table 2</a>).

Atrophic vaginitis is a common cause of vaginitis in hypoestrogenic women. In premenopausal women, hypoestrogenic settings include the postpartum period, lactation, and during administration of antiestrogenic drugs (and sometimes with low estrogen levels related to contraceptives). Menopausal women receiving hormone therapy may not have adequate estrogen levels for vaginal health and thus remain prone to atrophic vaginitis.

An acute process is likely to have an infectious etiology; a chronic process is more likely from inflammation unrelated to infection. If the woman has had recurrent episodes of vaginitis, look up the results of past diagnostic testing, the type of therapy she received, and her response to this therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Associated symptoms</strong> - Does the patient have pelvic pain or systemic symptoms (eg, fever, nausea)? Pelvic pain is suggestive of pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) and suprapubic pain is suggestive of cystitis; both are rare with vaginitis. The common causes of vaginitis are not associated with systemic symptoms.

What is the gender of her sex partner? Women who have sex with women are at increased risk of bacterial vaginosis. Has there been exposure to a new sexual partner? A new sexual partner increases the risk of acquiring sexually transmitted infections such as Trichomonas vaginalis, or cervicitis related to Neisseria gonorrhoeae or Chlamydia trachomatis. Is there a history of sexually transmitted infection?

Some clinicians believe it has a pathogenic role in vulvovaginitis and report an ameliorative effect on vulvovaginal symptoms with antibiotic treatment (oral penicillin or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> cream). We and most experts do not believe this organism has a pathogenic role in symptomatic vulvovaginitis and that positive culture results merely reflect colonization, which is facilitated by disruption of the normal vaginal bacterial environment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-women-with-symptoms-of-vaginitis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

Signs and symptoms are similar, irrespective of the underlying etiology. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H635661\" class=\"local\">'Causes of vaginitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women with vaginitis typically present with one or more of the following: change in vaginal discharge, pruritus, burning, irritation, erythema, dyspareunia, spotting, and dysuria. (See <a href=\"#H635499\" class=\"local\">'Patient presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnostic evaluation for bacterial vaginosis, vulvovaginal candidiasis, and trichomoniasis is important since these disorders account for over 90 percent of infection-related vaginitis in premenopausal women. (See <a href=\"#H635661\" class=\"local\">'Causes of vaginitis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H635637\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical findings may suggest a particular diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F81449\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81449 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F68759\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68759 \">table 2</a>). Measurement of vaginal pH is the single most important finding that drives the diagnostic process and should always be determined. Laboratory documentation of the etiology of vaginitis is mandatory before initiating therapy, given the nonspecific nature of the symptoms. Empiric therapy should be avoided because of frequent misdiagnosis and inappropriate therapy when assessment is based on history and physical examination alone. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trichomonas is classically associated with a greenish-yellow purulent discharge; candidiasis with a thick, white, adherent, &quot;cottage cheese-like&quot; discharge; and bacterial vaginosis with a thin, homogeneous, &quot;fishy smelling&quot; gray discharge. However, the appearance of the discharge is not a reliable basis for diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Saline microscopy should be performed to look for candidal yeast buds or hyphae (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F59030\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59030 \">picture 5</a>), motile trichomonads (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F71667\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71667 \">picture 6</a>), epithelial cells studded with adherent coccobacilli (clue cells suggesting bacterial vaginosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F73248\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73248 \">picture 8</a>)), and polymorphonuclear cells. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Microscopy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial office evaluation (history and physical examination, vaginal pH, wet mount microscopy, whiff test) correctly diagnoses 60 percent of <em>Candida</em> vulvovaginitis, 70 percent of trichomoniasis, and 90 percent of bacterial vaginosis. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest culture for <em>Candida</em> species for either <em>Candida</em> or <em>Trichomonas </em>(or a rapid antigen and nucleic acid amplification test), as indicated by clinical findings, if microscopy is negative because microscopy is not sufficiently sensitive to exclude these diagnoses in symptomatic patients. Bacterial cultures are rarely indicated in women with vaginal discharge. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Vaginal culture or NAAT'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the woman had minimal symptoms at the time of initial evaluation and the evaluation was nondiagnostic, the evaluation should be repeated at a second visit when she is symptomatic. In other cases, less common and rare infectious and inflammatory disorders need to be considered.
