Following decades of research, the relationship between fat intake and these health outcomes is becoming clearer. While recommendations from several authoritative United States organizations over the past two decades have emphasized decreasing the total amount of fat in the diet, the overall body of research indicates that the type of fat is far more important than the proportion of calories from total fat. Consistent with this, the 2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee recommended no upper limit on the percentage of calories from total fat.</p><p>Issues regarding dietary fat are reviewed here. The management of patients with hypercholesterolemia and the role of diet and dietary supplements in lipid lowering are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-elevated-low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol-ldl-c-in-primary-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of elevated low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lipid-lowering-with-diet-or-dietary-supplements\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lipid lowering with diet or dietary supplements&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H626354751\"><span class=\"h1\">RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients who do not require special diets for existing diseases (eg, chronic kidney disease, celiac disease, eating disorder), it is reasonable to suggest that patients:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not focus on trying to restrict total fat intake; instead, increase consumption of minimally processed, bioactive-rich foods like fruits, nuts, vegetables, legumes, and whole-grain products, which are natural alternatives to foods high in animal and hydrogenated fats, starch, and sugars.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid consumption of low-fat or &quot;fat-free&quot; varieties of naturally high-fat foods (eg, snack foods) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-fat/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. These foods increase intake of refined carbohydrates, which have been associated with higher triglyceride-rich lipoproteins and lower high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-fat/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], a possible increase in the incidence of type 2 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-fat/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>] and obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-fat/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], and failure to gain the benefits of more healthful alternatives.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduce the intake of industrially produced trans fatty acids by avoiding foods containing partially hydrogenated vegetable oils (eg, vanaspati or stick margarine, commercially baked goods, deep-fried fast foods, and street vendor foods). In the United States, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has determined that partially hydrogenated vegetable oils are no longer &ldquo;generally regarded as safe&rdquo; (GRAS) and has recommended they be removed from the food supply by mid-2018 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-fat/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When fats are needed for cooking, spreads, and other uses, use oils from fruits, seeds, and nuts with high amounts of monounsaturated <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> polyunsaturated fatty acids, especially n-3 polyunsaturated fats, including canola oil, soybean oil, and olive oil (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F51635\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51635 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Choose foods rich in healthy fats including nuts, seeds, avocadoes, and fish.</p><p/><p>These suggestions are generally consistent with the 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-fat/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H154632527\" class=\"local\">'Guidelines'</a> below.)</p><p>Health effects of dairy fats remain uncertain and controversial. Most guidelines, including the 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, continue to recommend low-fat dairy products.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TOTAL FAT INTAKE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several reasons to be circumspect regarding strong recommendations to reduce total fat intake to below 30, or perhaps even 35, percent of energy. First, the evidence that a high total fat intake is harmful is weak [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-fat/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Furthermore, the recommendation to limit fat intake was based upon research of its effects on total blood cholesterol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-fat/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The subsequent emphasis on fat intake has thus tended to limit our vision of a disease-protecting diet to those factors which affect atherosclerosis. We are now aware of many other pathways by which components in the diet can affect not only atherosclerosis, but also thrombosis as well as other chronic diseases of adulthood. Such factors include the quantity and quality of the other macronutrients (carbohydrate, protein), antioxidants, folate and its cofactors, and other vitamins and minerals.</p><p>Other issues with regard to the recommendation for a low-fat diet include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The role of dietary fat in the etiology of obesity is unclear.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is difficult to communicate to patients how to achieve a target level of fat intake.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The message to reduce dietary fat has been translated by food manufacturers and consumers into a potentially harmful set of food choices, particularly those rich in starch and sugar, which appear to have contributed to the obesity epidemic.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Effects of dietary fat intake</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evidence is weak that a high intake of fat per se is harmful in terms of heart disease, cancer, or obesity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Heart disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Populations with a higher total fat intake do not always have more heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-fat/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. In the Seven Countries Study, for example, the locations with the lowest incidence of coronary heart disease were Crete and Japan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-fat/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, the Japanese had a very low fat intake, while individuals in Crete typically had a high total fat intake, chiefly composed of monounsaturated fats from vegetable sources (olive oil).</p><p>Comparisons across populations can be confounded by other factors. However, even cohort studies within a population have not produced compelling evidence that total fat intake is associated with the incidence of coronary heart disease. As an example, in an analysis from the Nurses' Health Study involving 20-year follow-up of 80,000 women, the multivariate adjusted relative risk (RR) of coronary heart disease for the highest quintile of dietary fat compared with the lowest was 0.92 (95% CI 0.77-1.09) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-fat/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. A meta-analysis of cohort studies, including the Nurses' Health Study, revealed no association of total fat intake with either coronary events or death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-fat/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Only a small number of randomized trials have examined the effect of changing diet upon cardiovascular end points, and few have achieved substantial differences in total fat intake between the intervention and control diets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-fat/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>]. The largest such study, the Women's Health Initiative, randomly assigned 48,835 women (97 percent with no history of cardiovascular disease) to an intensive behavior-modification group, with a goal of reducing total fat intake to 20 percent of calories and increasing daily intake of vegetables and grains, or to a control group who received dietary education materials; mean follow-up was 8.1 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-fat/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. After six years, women in the intervention group had decreased total fat intake compared with the control group (28.8 versus 37.0 percent of calories from fat), but the intervention had no effect on overall coronary heart disease (hazard ratio [HR] 0.94, 95% CI 0.86-1.02) or stroke (HR 1.02, CI 0.90-1.17). Although the intervention group reduced the potentially harmful saturated and trans fats, they also reduced the potentially beneficial monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-fat/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Type of fat'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The relationship between fat intake and the development of cancer is even less well-documented than that of coronary heart disease. Some cross-cultural studies have suggested a role for high total fat intake in the genesis of breast, colon, and prostate cancers, but these studies, like those of heart disease, could be confounded by other factors.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Case-control studies of diet and breast cancer have suggested a modest role for total fat intake. In one summary of results from 12 case-control studies, the relative risk of breast cancer was estimated to be 1.35 for each 100 g increment in daily intake of fat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-fat/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. By contrast, cohort studies, which do not have the inherent recall bias of case-control studies, have generally not found this association. In a pooled analysis of seven cohort studies, for example, each 25 g increment of fat intake, adjusted for energy intake, was associated with a relative risk of breast cancer of only 1.05 (95 percent confidence interval 0.94 to 1.11) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-fat/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Furthermore, in an analysis of the Nurses' Health Study, a prospective cohort study of 88,795 women, there was no evidence that either lower total fat intake or lower intake of specific types of fat decreased the risk of breast cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-fat/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Associations between fat intake and colon cancer may be explained by red meat consumption rather than total fat intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-fat/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The bulk of epidemiologic evidence supports a role for dietary fat in the pathogenesis of prostate cancer, although the data are inconclusive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-fat/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The association may be stronger with animal than with vegetable fat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-fat/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perhaps most importantly, the Women's Health Initiative trial described above found that, at a mean follow-up of 8.1 years, the intervention to reduce total fat intake had no meaningful effect on risk of colorectal cancer (HR 1.08, 95% CI 0.90-1.29) or breast cancer (HR 0.91, CI 0.83-1.01) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-fat/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Obesity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of obesity in the United States has been rising for decades [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-fat/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>], prompting researchers to examine the role of dietary constituents in promoting an increase in body fat.</p><p>The comparative roles of different diet compositions, including low-fat diets, in reducing weight are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obesity-in-adults-dietary-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obesity in adults: Dietary therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPE OF FAT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The type of fat consumed may be considerably more important than total fat intake (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F75539\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75539 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-fat/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In general, industrial trans fats should be avoided. Substituting polyunsaturated for saturated fats appears to lower cardiovascular risk, whereas substituting carbohydrates for saturated fat does not reduce risk (and may cause excess weight gain). (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Polyunsaturated fatty acids'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Trans fatty acids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some trans fatty acids occur naturally in foods, especially those of animal origin, although most trans fatty acid consumption is a result of the industrial hydrogenation of polyunsaturated fatty acids. Trans fatty acids from this source appear to confer harmful cardiovascular effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-fat/abstract/30-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-36</a>].</p><p>The chemical configuration of these trans fatty acids adversely affect blood low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-fat/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. An outpatient feeding study compared effects of six diets containing different types of fat, but with total fat kept at 30 percent of energy, among 18 women and 18 men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-fat/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Compared with a butter-enriched diet, diets relatively higher in trans fat resulted in smaller reductions in LDL cholesterol and larger reductions in HDL cholesterol (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F56524\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56524 \">table 2</a>). The stick margarine diet, highest in trans fatty acids, resulted in a total:HDL cholesterol ratio that was 4 percent higher than the high saturated fat diet. The diets with the most favorable lipid profiles were the soybean and liquid margarine diets, characterized by low amounts of both saturated and trans fatty acids.</p><p>By comparison, consumption of saturated fats also raises the LDL cholesterol concentration but does not lower HDL (see <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Saturated fatty acids'</a> below). Thus, while saturated fats adversely affect the lipid profile, they may not be as harmful as trans fatty acids.</p><p>Trans fatty acids may also interfere with the desaturation and elongation of n-3 (omega-3) fatty acids. These are important for the prevention of heart disease and complications of pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Heart disease'</a> below.)</p><p>Some studies have linked the consumption of trans fatty acids, or foods that contain them, with adverse cardiovascular outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-fat/abstract/30-35,38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-35,38,39</a>]. In an analysis from the Nurses' Health Study, for each increase of 2 percent of energy from trans fat, the relative risk for incident coronary heart disease was 1.93 (95% CI 1.43-2.61) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-fat/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Calculations suggest that replacement of trans fatty acids with other sources of fat, even saturated fatty acids, can reduce coronary risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-fat/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>Today's margarines, which are generally softer than the older varieties, contain less trans fatty acids than previously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-fat/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. However, trans fatty acids are still a component of many commercial baked goods, such as cookies and cakes, and most deep-fried foods. A clue to their presence is the words &quot;partially hydrogenated&quot; on the list of package ingredients. Partial hydrogenation results in fats that are easier to cook with and spoil less easily than naturally occurring oils: &quot;They keep our pastries firm and our margarine stiff at room temperature&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-fat/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>Starting in 2006, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required that Nutrition Facts labels portray trans fat content. Several areas in the United States and Europe have passed legislation to restrict trans fats from foods served commercially [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-fat/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. Some evidence suggests that food manufacturers have responded by reducing trans fat content of products sold in restaurants and stores [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-fat/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Observational evidence also suggests that in the United States, consumption of trans fat decreased between 1999 to 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-fat/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. In June 2015, the FDA released its final determination that partially hydrogenated vegetable oils are no longer &ldquo;generally regarded as safe&rdquo; (GRAS) and has recommended they be removed from the food supply by mid-2018 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-fat/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>In contrast to most trans fatty acids discussed above, trans-palmitoleic acid is a trans fatty acid derived from naturally occurring dairy and other ruminant trans fats, consumption of which is not associated with higher cardiovascular risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-fat/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>] and may confer benefit by decreasing insulin resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-fat/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-type-2-diabetes-mellitus#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Dairy products'</a>.)</p><p>Despite the possible benefit of trans-palmitoleic acid, it seems reasonable to reduce overall consumption of trans fatty acids given their adverse effects on cardiovascular outcomes discussed above.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Saturated fatty acids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Saturated fat, derived chiefly from animal products, raises the total serum cholesterol. Saturated fatty acids with carbon chain lengths of 14 (myristic) and 16 (palmitic), chiefly found in dairy products and red meats, appear most potent in increasing the serum cholesterol. Stearic acid (18 carbons), another component of beef and the chief fatty acid of cocoa butter, is relatively less cholesterolemic.</p><p>Studies have shown a continuous, graded relationship between the total serum cholesterol concentration and coronary heart disease events and mortality (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F60146\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60146 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-fat/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. However, a 2014 systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective observational studies and randomized trials found no association between intake of saturated fat and risk for coronary heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-fat/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Many faulted this analysis as it did not focus on what dietary component(s) replaced saturated fat in the individual studies. Other systematic reviews and meta-analyses have found that replacing saturated fats with polyunsaturated fats (instead of carbohydrates or monounsaturated fats) may decrease the risk of coronary heart disease events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-fat/abstract/50-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">50-53</a>]. For example, a 2015 systematic review and meta-analysis of 15 randomized trials found that decreasing saturated fat intake was associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular events (relative risk [RR] 0.83, 95% CI 0.72-0.96) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-fat/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Subgroup analysis suggested that the reduction was seen primarily when saturated fat was replaced with polyunsaturated fat but not with carbohydrates or protein. However, another study, using data from the Nurse&rsquo;s Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study, did find a decrease in the hazard ratio for coronary disease when 1 percent of energy from palmitic acid (the most abundant saturated fatty acid) was replaced with polyunsaturated fat, whole-grain carbohydrates, or plant proteins (but not with monounsaturated fat) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-fat/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p>Both HDL and LDL cholesterol may be reduced if saturated fats are replaced by carbohydrates, while triglyceride-rich lipoproteins such as very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL) and chylomicron remnants may be increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-fat/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Less reduction in HDL cholesterol is apparent if saturated fats are replaced by unsaturated fats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-fat/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Also, replacing saturated fatty acids with trans fatty acids, which lower HDL cholesterol and raise LDL cholesterol, may be harmful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-fat/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Monounsaturated fatty acids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no consensus on recommendations for the consumption of monounsaturated fatty acids in the diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-fat/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. A 2014 meta-analysis of prospective observational studies found no association between intake of monounsaturated fat and risk for coronary heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-fat/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Similarly, a 2014 meta-analysis of randomized trials of dietary fatty acid modification for secondary prevention found no relationship between monounsaturated fatty acid intake and coronary heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-fat/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p>Based on observational data and biologic plausibility, some authors recommend an increase in monounsaturated fatty acids when saturated fatty acids are decreased, leading to no net decrease in total fat. Good vegetable sources of monounsaturated fats include olive oil and canola oil.</p><p>Replacing saturated fats with monounsaturated fats may decrease LDL cholesterol and triglycerides as well as maintain HDL cholesterol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-fat/abstract/55,59,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,59,60</a>]. Monounsaturated fatty acids can also decrease the oxidation of LDL cholesterol, a key step in atherosclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-fat/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. The in vivo implications of these findings are not yet clear, in part because much of the monounsaturated fats in the United States diet have come from animal rather than vegetable sources, and studies have not been able to distinguish the two sources. There is no consensus on recommendations for the consumption of monounsaturated fatty acids in the diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-fat/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lipoprotein-classification-metabolism-and-role-in-atherosclerosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lipoprotein classification, metabolism, and role in atherosclerosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In cross-cultural studies, Mediterranean populations that consume high amounts of monounsaturated fats from extra-virgin olive and nuts appear to be protected against heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-fat/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. A randomized trial evaluating this hypothesis demonstrated that extra virgin olive oil and mixed nuts, in combination with a traditional Mediterranean-type diet, reduced risk of heart attacks, stroke, and death by about 30 percent (from approximately 11 to 8 events per 1000 person-years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-fat/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. In patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, change from a polyunsaturated to monounsaturated diet reduces insulin resistance and restores endothelium-dependent vasodilatation, providing a possible mechanism by which a &quot;Mediterranean diet&quot; reduces the risk of atherosclerotic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-fat/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>].
