The progression of growth is interpreted within the context of the genetic potential for a particular child [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-growth-patterns-in-infants-and-prepubertal-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Normal growth is a reflection of overall health and nutritional status. Understanding the normal patterns of growth enables the early detection of pathologic deviations (eg, poor weight gain due to a metabolic disorder, short stature due to inflammatory bowel disease) and can prevent the unnecessary evaluation of children with acceptable normal variations in growth.</p><p>A review of normal growth patterns during infancy and childhood will be provided below. Growth during puberty is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-puberty\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal puberty&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DETERMINANTS OF NORMAL GROWTH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Somatic growth and biologic maturation are influenced by several factors that act independently and in concert to modify a child's genetic growth potential. The influence of maternal nutrition and intrauterine environment are reflected primarily in the growth parameters at the time of birth and during the first month of life, whereas genetic factors have a later influence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-growth-patterns-in-infants-and-prepubertal-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The correlation coefficient between length and adult height is only 0.25 at birth, but increases to 0.8 at two years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-growth-patterns-in-infants-and-prepubertal-children/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>Although primarily reflected in the growth parameters at birth, long-term influences of maternal nutrition and intrauterine environment on subsequent growth and pubertal development have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-growth-patterns-in-infants-and-prepubertal-children/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Studies in various populations have demonstrated an association between catch-up growth or rapid growth in infancy or early childhood and subsequent obesity, suggesting that mechanisms that signal and regulate catch-up growth in the postnatal period may play a role in the development of obesity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-epidemiology-and-etiology-of-obesity-in-children-and-adolescents#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition; epidemiology; and etiology of obesity in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Metabolic programming'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">NORMAL PATTERNS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most healthy infants and children grow in a predictable fashion, following a typical pattern of progression in weight, length, and head circumference. Normal human growth is pulsatile; periods of rapid growth (&quot;growth spurts&quot;) are separated by periods of no measurable growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-growth-patterns-in-infants-and-prepubertal-children/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. Growth is also seasonal, with growth velocities increased during the spring and summer months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-growth-patterns-in-infants-and-prepubertal-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Growth velocity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Growth velocity, the change in growth over time, is a more sensitive index of growth than is a single measurement.

Nonetheless, their weight, length, and body mass index (BMI) usually are less than those of singletons during the first 2.5 years of life, even after correcting for gestational age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-growth-patterns-in-infants-and-prepubertal-children/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].

Although the weights of breastfed and formula-fed infants are similar by 12 to 23 months of age, the typical pattern of slowed weight gain after three to four months among breastfed infants may lead to early introduction of solid foods or cessation of breastfeeding if the slowed weight gain is perceived as lactational inadequacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-growth-patterns-in-infants-and-prepubertal-children/abstract/24,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,27</a>]. The use of a weight chart derived from a population of breastfed infants may prevent this misperception.

Periods of rapid growth are separated by periods of no measurable growth. Growth is also seasonal, with growth velocities increased during the spring and summer months. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Normal patterns'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Growth velocity, the change in growth over time, is a more sensitive index of growth than is a single measurement. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Growth velocity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Compared with formula-fed infants, breastfed infants gain weight relatively rapidly during the first three to four months of life and relatively slowly thereafter. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Method of feeding'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight and height should be plotted on the appropriate growth chart at each well-child visit. Head circumference and weight-for-length should be plotted for children younger than two years of age and body mass index for children older than two years. The accurate charting of growth may prevent the unnecessary evaluation or intervention of a child who has a normal pattern of growth. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Growth charts'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The <a href=\"http://www.who.int/childgrowth/standards/en/&amp;token=6GtnCt1znE2nk6FXrg7/qWC6dFaE2HggSfkiCt8RyMy3AMNvca6NYPtJ4Gd8FaPIii+Rc5+14ln/6vbHaSk7ig==&amp;TOPIC_ID=2845\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">World Health Organization growth charts</a> should be used for infants and children &lt;24 months of age, regardless of method of feeding. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'WHO growth charts'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The growth of preterm infants can be plotted on the standard growth charts. However, there is no consensus about how long to continue such correction. The rate and duration of &quot;catch-up growth&quot; may vary depending upon gestational age, birth weight, <span class=\"nowrap\">race/ethnicity,</span> and other factors. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Correcting for prematurity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Assessment of proportionality is useful as a screen of nutritional status, to diagnose overweight and obesity, and in generating a differential diagnosis for short or tall stature.
