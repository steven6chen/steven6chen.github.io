The destruction of alveolar walls causes loss of elastic recoil, early airway closure during exhalation, and air trapping in the distal air spaces. Alveolar wall destruction with formation of emphysematous blebs and bullae leads to loss of gas exchanging surface (also known as increased physiologic dead space). In addition, air trapping and hyperinflation press the diaphragm into a flat configuration, rather than its normal domed shape, and place all the muscles of respiration at a mechanical overstretch disadvantage. In combination, these processes lead to refractory dyspnea.</p><p>Lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS, also called reduction pneumoplasty or bilateral pneumectomy) is a surgical treatment for patients with advanced emphysema whose dyspnea is poorly controlled with the usual therapies (eg, short and long acting bronchodilators, inhaled glucocorticoids, supplemental oxygen, and pulmonary rehabilitation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-copd-bronchoscopic-treatment-of-emphysema/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. LVRS entails reducing the lung volume by wedge excisions of emphysematous tissue. However, surgical morbidity is high and non-pulmonary comorbidities may preclude surgery.</p><p>Bronchoscopic lung volume reduction (bLVR) refers to techniques developed to treat hyperinflation due to emphysema via a flexible bronchoscope.</p><p>The devices and techniques for bLVR will be reviewed here. The general management of COPD, an overview of flexible bronchoscopy, and the roles of lung volume reduction surgery, bullectomy, and lung transplantation in the management of advanced COPD are discussed separately.

However, it is believed that the removal of diseased, hyperinflated areas of lung would have the following benefits: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As overall hyperinflation decreases, diaphragm and chest wall mechanics would improve and work of breathing would decrease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The remaining lung tissue would have more normal elastic recoil pressure, thereby restoring the outward circumferential pull on the bronchioles and increasing expiratory airflow.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With improved expiratory airflow, the amount of hyperinflation associated with exercise (also known as dynamic hyperinflation) would decrease, and thereby reduce exercise related dyspnea.

However, the morbidity of LVRS is substantial. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-volume-reduction-surgery-in-copd#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lung volume reduction surgery in COPD&quot;, section on 'Primary endpoints'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-volume-reduction-surgery-in-copd#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lung volume reduction surgery in COPD&quot;, section on 'Complications'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-volume-reduction-surgery-in-copd#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lung volume reduction surgery in COPD&quot;, section on 'Long-term outcomes'</a>.)</p><p>The rationale for bronchoscopic LVR (bLVR) is that the use of endoscopic methods (eg, valves, sealants, thermal ablation) to collapse areas of overinflated emphysematous lung would have a beneficial effect similar to resecting these areas during LVRS, but without the morbidity of surgery. Thus, patients who are not good surgical candidates might be able to undergo bLVR. Several bLVR techniques are reversible, which may contribute to increased safety. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-volume-reduction-surgery-in-copd#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lung volume reduction surgery in COPD&quot;, section on 'Rationale of LVRS'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12785496\"><span class=\"h1\">PROPOSED TECHNIQUES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Proposed techniques for bronchoscopic lung volume reduction (bLVR) include endobronchial placement of one-way valves, plugs and blockers, endobronchial instillation of biologic sealants, thermal airway ablation, and airway stents for decompression of bullae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-copd-bronchoscopic-treatment-of-emphysema/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. None of these techniques have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration, and none are available for general clinical use. Endobronchial plugs and blockers were the initial method developed to promote resorption atelectasis, but the high rate of post-obstructive pneumonia and migration of the plugs and blockers has led to abandonment of these devices.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12785503\"><span class=\"h2\">Valves</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One-way valves have been designed for bronchoscopic placement based on the hypothesis that they will allow air and mucus to exit the treated area, but not allow air to re-enter. The goal of this treatment is to facilitate atelectasis of the emphysematous, hyperinflated lung distal to the valve.</p><p>Two valve designs, called endobronchial and intrabronchial, are under investigation for the endoscopic treatment of emphysema. They differ in the design by which the one-way valve is created; the endobronchial valve uses a duckbill shape (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F76276%7EPULM%2F64484\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76276 graphicRef64484 \">picture 1A-B</a>) and the intrabronchial valve uses an umbrella shape (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F55269\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55269 \">picture 2</a>). Both valves are deployed within the bronchus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12785510\"><span class=\"h3\">Endobronchial valves</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial design of the endobronchial valve (EBV) system (Pulmonx) was that of a nitinol skeleton and a silicone body with a &quot;duckbill&quot; valve on the proximal end. The first two designs were deployed in an over-the-wire technique, meaning that the guidewire was placed in the target airway under bronchoscopic guidance, the bronchoscope was removed leaving the guidewire in place, and the delivery catheter passed over the guidewire to insert the valve. The third and most recent version of the EBV, known as the Zephyr valve, maintains the &quot;duckbill&quot; mechanism, but its deployment catheter can be inserted through the working channel of a bronchoscope under direct vision (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F76276%7EPULM%2F64484\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76276 graphicRef64484 \">picture 1A-B</a>). The deployment catheter also acts as a sizing mechanism, enabling the bronchoscopist to select the size valve that will best fit that bronchus. Three sizes of valve are available (4.0 low profile, 4.0, and 5.5, corresponding to the minimum width of the subsegment to be treated).</p><p>Several case series, a multicenter registry, and randomized trials have reported modest improvements in symptoms and lung function after bLVR with placement of Zephyr valves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-copd-bronchoscopic-treatment-of-emphysema/abstract/5-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-12</a>]. Inclusion and exclusion criteria have been similar to the National Emphysema Treatment Trial (NETT) protocol (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F69501\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69501 \">table 1</a>); patients with a forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) less than 20 percent of predicted, hypercapnia, pulmonary hypertension, or a low diffusing capacity (DLCO) (less than 25 percent of predicted) were excluded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-copd-bronchoscopic-treatment-of-emphysema/abstract/1,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7,8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-volume-reduction-surgery-in-copd#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lung volume reduction surgery in COPD&quot;, section on 'National Emphysema Treatment Trial'</a>.)</p><p>It appears that the best candidates are patients with intact interlobar fissures and no evidence of collateral ventilation that would prevent resorption atelectasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-copd-bronchoscopic-treatment-of-emphysema/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>]. Without atelectasis of the emphysematous areas, hyperinflation is unlikely to improve. Thus, a specialized catheter has been developed for bronchoscopic assessment of collateral ventilation, known as the Chartis System [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-copd-bronchoscopic-treatment-of-emphysema/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Endobronchial Valve for Emphysema Palliation Trial (VENT) was performed to evaluate unilateral treatment with endobronchial valves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-copd-bronchoscopic-treatment-of-emphysema/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. The trial randomly assigned 321 patients with severe heterogeneous emphysema (FEV<sub>1</sub> 15 to 45 percent of predicted value) to bronchoscopic placement of Zephyr endobronchial valves or standard medical care in a 2:1 ratio. High resolution computed tomography (HRCT) was used to target the areas of greatest heterogeneity (ie, the difference in the proportion of pixels of less than -910 Hounsfield units between the targeted lobe and ipsilateral adjacent nontargeted lobe) for valve placement. The valves were placed under moderate sedation or general anesthesia in lobar, segmental, and subsegmental bronchi to completely isolate the targeted lobe. At six months, the mean between group difference for FEV<sub>1</sub> was 6.8 percent (95% CI 2.1-11.5) and for six-minute walk distance (6MWD) 5.8 percent (95% CI 0.5-11.2). Modest improvements in dyspnea and quality of life were also noted. The frequency of adverse events was higher in the endobronchial valve group and included pneumonia, hemoptysis, pneumothorax, and exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) requiring hospitalization. Among patients with a radiographically complete lobar fissure, a clinically important improvement in FEV<sub>1</sub> was more likely. Similar findings were noted in the European VENT study cohort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-copd-bronchoscopic-treatment-of-emphysema/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a follow-up to the VENT trials described above, the STELVIO trial recruited 84 patients with severe emphysema (baseline FEV<sub>1</sub> 29 &plusmn;7 percent of predicted) and an HRCT finding of fissure integrity between the target lobe and the adjacent lobe (suggesting low likelihood of collateral ventilation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-copd-bronchoscopic-treatment-of-emphysema/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Flexible bronchoscopy was performed to determine physiologically whether collateral ventilation was present based on results of occlusion of the target lobe; 16 patients were excluded because of collateral ventilation or unfavorable airway anatomy. The 68 remaining study subjects were randomly assigned to receive bronchoscopic Zephyr endobronchial valve placement (average four per lobe) or standard medical care. After six months, the increases in lung function and exercise tolerance in the endobronchial valve group were greater than in the usual care group: by 140 mL for FEV<sub>1</sub> (95% CI 55-225), by 347 mL for FVC (95% CI 107-588) and by 74 m for the 6MWD (95% CI 47-100). However, serious adverse events occurred in the valve group including one death, pneumothoraces in six (18 percent) patients, and the need to remove valves in seven (20 percent) patients due to adverse events, while five serious adverse events occurred in the usual care group. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The multicenter IMPACT trial examined the effect of endobronchial valve placement under Chartis guidance in 93 patients with severe, homogeneous emphysema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-copd-bronchoscopic-treatment-of-emphysema/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Participants were randomly assigned to endobronchial valve placement plus standard of care or standard of care alone (without a sham procedure). At three months, FEV<sub>1</sub> had improved in the valve group relative to control (mean between group difference 17 percent, 95% CI 8.1-25.8). The six-minute walk distance increased by 40 meters (95% CI 15-65). Quality of life also improved, although the COPD Assessment Test (CAT) did not improve. Pneumothorax occurred in 11 participants (25.6 percent), requiring hospitalization and chest tube drainage. Valve removal or replacement was needed in five participants. Longer term follow-up of these patients is planned.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12785517\"><span class=\"h3\">Intrabronchial valves</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The second valve design to undergo investigation in the United States was the Spiration implantable Intrabronchial Valve (IBV valve; Spiration). This device is an umbrella-shaped nitinol framed prosthesis with a synthetic polymer cover. The flexible nitinol frame allows for the valve to maintain contact with the airway wall and prevent air from passing inwards while allowing for mucus and air to escape. This creates a one-way valve effect with the intent of redirecting airflow to more normal areas <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> inducing atelectasis of the emphysematous area blocked by the valve.</p><p>The valve can be deployed through the working channel of a flexible bronchoscope under direct vision. Valve sizes range from 5 to 7 mm. After the appropriate airways are selected, a calibrated balloon is used to determine the valve with the best fit for the airway. Then, under direct vision, the valve deployment device is passed through the working channel of the bronchoscope and the valve is deployed. If the valve needs to be repositioned or removed, a standard biopsy forceps is used to grab the central rod; when the rod is pulled, the umbrella collapses and can be removed. Several small modifications have been made on this valve, but the basic design has changed little (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F55269\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55269 \">picture 2</a>).</p><p>In a multicenter trial, 73 patients with severe emphysema were randomly assigned to Spiration IBV placement or sham bronchoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-copd-bronchoscopic-treatment-of-emphysema/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. At three months, eight patients in the IBV group had a significant improvement on a quality of life questionnaire and a lobar volume shift (decrease in upper lobes and compensatory increase in the nontreated lobes &ge;7.5 percent) by computed tomography, while none of the sham-treated patients improved. The procedure was well-tolerated, but not effective in the majority of patients. </p><p>The Spiration IBV was also evaluated in a multicenter, prospective, open-enrollment cohort study which enrolled 30 patients in five centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-copd-bronchoscopic-treatment-of-emphysema/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Patients enrolled met criteria for LVRS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F69501\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69501 \">table 1</a>). Criteria for exclusion were prior listing for LVRS or transplant, high risk according to the NETT protocol, significant bronchospasm, or copious respiratory secretions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-copd-bronchoscopic-treatment-of-emphysema/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. No significant improvements were seen in physiological testing, including exercise capacity, pulmonary function testing, or gas exchange. However, a clinically and statistically significant improvement was noted in quality of life as measured by the St. George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) (an improvement of 6.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">[+/-</span> 14.3] units at six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-copd-bronchoscopic-treatment-of-emphysema/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]). This study showed that this procedure is feasible and can be performed without significant adverse events.</p><p>A multicenter trial that randomly assigned 277 subjects to IBV treatment versus sham bronchoscopy has been completed, but the results are not yet available. The primary outcome measures were improvement in the SGRQ and regional lung volume changes on computed tomography at six months. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4992606\"><span class=\"h2\">Coils</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nitinol coils behave like springs. They are passed through the working channel of a flexible bronchoscope in a straightened configuration into subsegmental airways and out into the lung parenchyma. As they are deployed, they resume their coiled shape and thereby collect and collapse the lung tissue in that area (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F93172\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef93172 \">image 1</a>). A potential advantage may be that collateral ventilation would have no effect on this technique, as opposed to the valve techniques described above. (See <a href=\"#H12785503\" class=\"local\">'Valves'</a> above.)</p><p>A few clinical trials have examined the effect of endobronchial coils in severe emphysema and have found a variable degree of benefit.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A multicenter trial randomly assigned 315 patients with predominantly homogeneous emphysema and severe hyperinflation to one of two groups: usual care, including guideline based medications and pulmonary rehabilitation, or usual care plus bilateral placement of endobronchial coils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-copd-bronchoscopic-treatment-of-emphysema/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. For participants receiving coils, 10 to 14 coils were placed in one lung in the first procedure; four months later the procedure was repeated, placing 10 to 14 coils in the other lung. After one year, the group receiving coils experienced a small increase in their six-minute walk test distance and a small increase in FEV<sub>1</sub>; both changes were below the level considered clinically significant. Major complications occurred in 35 percent of the coil group versus 19 percent of the usual care group. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a multicenter trial, 100 patients with severe emphysema (FEV<sub>1</sub> &lt;50 percent of predicted and residual volume &gt;220 percent of predicted) were randomly assigned to undergo endobronchial deployment of nitinol coils (approximately 10 coils per lobe in two lobes, one on each side) or usual care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-copd-bronchoscopic-treatment-of-emphysema/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Two-thirds of the patients had homogeneous emphysema, considered an unfavorable pattern for surgical LVRS. At six months, 36 percent of the coil group experienced more than a 54 m improvement in the six-minute walk distance, compared with 18 percent in the control group. The improvements in FEV<sub>1</sub> and lung function at 6 and 12 months were significantly greater in the coil group. Pneumonia was the most frequent serious adverse event, occurring in 18 percent of the coil group and 4 percent of the control group.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a multicenter, observational study, 60 patients with severe heterogeneous emphysema (mean FEV<sub>1</sub> 30.2 percent predicted) underwent bronchoscopic placement of nitinol coils (55 bilateral, 5 unilateral) with a median of 10 coils per lobe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-copd-bronchoscopic-treatment-of-emphysema/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Serious adverse events included seven COPD exacerbations, four pneumothoraces, and one episode of hemoptysis. After 6 and 12 months, modest but sustained improvements were noted in quality of life, FEV<sub>1</sub> (approximately 110 mL at both time points), and six-minute walk distance (approximately 30 and 51 meters, respectively).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In two smaller observational studies with a combined total of 23 patients, coil placement was associated with improved pulmonary function and exercise tolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-copd-bronchoscopic-treatment-of-emphysema/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. Adverse effects included hemoptysis (12 patients), transient chest pain (4 patients), dyspnea (10 patients), exacerbation of COPD (3 patients), and pneumothorax (1 patient). </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12785524\"><span class=\"h2\">Biologic lung volume reduction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Biologic lung volume reduction uses direct application of a <span class=\"nowrap\">sealant/remodeling</span> system to collapse areas of emphysema. The initial method applied fibrin-thrombin mixtures to selected endobronchial locations to collapse hyperinflated areas of emphysematous lung through resorptive atelectasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-copd-bronchoscopic-treatment-of-emphysema/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. Although this method was partially successful, a revised technique, called BioLVR, was developed, adding chondroitin sulfate and poly-L-lysine to the fibrin mixture. A hydrogel is created when the fibrin and thrombin solutions mix, theoretically providing a scaffold for fibroblast attachment and collagen synthesis that promotes scarring and prevents future recanalization and ventilation of the treated area. It is thought that the hydrogel sealant will block the interalveolar and bronchiolar-alveolar pores and channels, eradicating collateral ventilation, and thus promoting resorptive atelectasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-copd-bronchoscopic-treatment-of-emphysema/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. An alternative method uses a synthetic polymeric foam sealant called emphysematous lung sealant (ELS).</p><p>The procedure is performed under conscious sedation via flexible bronchoscopy. The bronchoscope is introduced into an airway leading to emphysematous alveoli and moved into wedged position, completely occluding the segment or subsegment to be treated. Suction is applied through the bronchoscope to collapse the distal airways in that segment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-copd-bronchoscopic-treatment-of-emphysema/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. An enzymatic primer solution (eg, porcine trypsin) is instilled to promote detachment of epithelial cells from the target region. After two minutes, the primer is removed by suction and 10 mL of cell culture media is used to wash out residual primer. Next, a dual lumen catheter with the thrombin mixture in one lumen and the fibrin mixture in the other is placed through the wedged bronchoscope. The contents of the two lumens are instilled, followed by 60 mL of air to push the solutions distally. The solutions mix as they are simultaneously delivered to the distal airway and alveoli. The liquid component is thought to fill the alveoli prior to complete polymerization, thus blocking collateral ventilation. Each subsegmental application takes approximately 10 minutes and four to eight subsegments are treated during a single procedure. </p><p>The technique has been used in a sheep model of papain induced emphysema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-copd-bronchoscopic-treatment-of-emphysema/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. After BioLVR, a 16 percent reduction in total lung capacity and a 55 percent reduction in residual volume were noted. At autopsy, no evidence was found of the abscess formation, infection, or granulomas. Scar formation was seen in 91 percent of treated segments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-copd-bronchoscopic-treatment-of-emphysema/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. </p><p>In a preliminary human study of biologic lung volume reduction, 22 patients with upper lobe predominant emphysema were treated with 20 mL of <span class=\"nowrap\">hydrogel/subsegment</span> and 28 with 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/subsegment</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-copd-bronchoscopic-treatment-of-emphysema/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The six month follow-up revealed a greater improvement in FVC, FEV<sub>1</sub>, and RV in the higher dose group compared with the low dose. No significant change in the six-minute walk test was seen in either group, compared with baseline. Chest computed tomography at six months revealed scarring and atelectasis in the previously hyperinflated area in the high-dose, but not the low dose group (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F57927\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef57927 \">image 2</a>). Similar findings were reported in a study of 25 patients with bilateral homogeneous emphysema in whom high or low dose hydrogel was administered to eight subsegments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-copd-bronchoscopic-treatment-of-emphysema/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>A separate observational study compared the effect of contiguous single lobe versus scattered double lobe BioLVR for upper lobe predominant emphysema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-copd-bronchoscopic-treatment-of-emphysema/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Targeting a single lobe led to a greater improvement in forced expiratory volume in one second at 12 weeks after the procedure, than treating scattered subsegments in both upper lobes. It is hypothesized that full treatment of one lobe prevented collateral ventilation leading to sustained lobar collapse and a better functional result [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-copd-bronchoscopic-treatment-of-emphysema/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Phase III studies of BioLVR are not planned.</p><p>Initial tests of the ELS (AeriSeal) were performed in 25 patients with heterogeneous emphysema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-copd-bronchoscopic-treatment-of-emphysema/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]; modest improvements in air trapping and gas transfer were noted among patients with GOLD stage III, but not among those with GOLD stage IV (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F82690\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82690 \">table 2</a>). The number of subsegment sites treated at one time varied from two to four. Five patients underwent a second instillation of ELS and additional clinical benefit was noted in two. In a randomized trial, 57 patients were randomly assigned to ELS (two subsegments in each upper lobe) plus medical therapy or medical therapy alone and followed for six months. Significant improvements from baseline were noted in lung function, dyspnea, and quality of life at three months when compared to control, and the benefits persisted for six months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-copd-bronchoscopic-treatment-of-emphysema/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. However, clinically important adverse events requiring hospitalization occurred in 44 percent of the treatment group in addition to two deaths. The study was terminated early due to financial problems.</p><p>Over 90 percent of patients treated with biologic lung volume reduction experience flu-like symptoms, such as fever, dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, nausea, headache, malaise, and leukocytosis within 24 hours of the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-copd-bronchoscopic-treatment-of-emphysema/abstract/33,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,39</a>].

The procedure utilizes a reusable vapor generator with a disposable bronchoscopic catheter that delivers heated water vapor to the targeted airways. During the procedure, a vapor occlusion balloon is inflated to protect other airways from the heated vapor. The goal is to induce an inflammatory response that will result in occlusion and atelectasis of that segment. It is hoped that the complication rate will be lower than with bronchial valve techniques, as no foreign body is left in place. The procedure is typically performed under general anesthesia.</p><p>In a multicenter observational study, 44 patients with upper lobe predominant emphysema underwent unilateral bronchoscopic thermal airway ablation or sham bronchoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-copd-bronchoscopic-treatment-of-emphysema/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. At six months, FEV<sub>1</sub> was improved by 141 <span class=\"nowrap\">+/-</span> 26 mL over baseline; exercise tolerance and quality of life also improved. Adverse events included exacerbations of COPD, pneumonia, lower respiratory tract infection, and hemoptysis. One patient died during an exacerbation of COPD, two months after the procedure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12785531\"><span class=\"h2\">Airway bypass procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Airway bypass or extra anatomic bronchial fenestration is a technique used to decompress areas of emphysema by placing a drug eluting stent through a bronchial wall into an area with severe emphysematous disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F68661\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68661 \">picture 3</a>). Because of collateral ventilation, emphysematous alveoli receive ventilation through interalveolar pores, accessory respiratory bronchioles, and interlobar pathways across fissures, despite airways obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-copd-bronchoscopic-treatment-of-emphysema/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The degree of collateral ventilation is thought to increase as homogeneity of emphysema increases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-copd-bronchoscopic-treatment-of-emphysema/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. The airway bypass technique was developed with the idea that decompression of emphysematous areas would lead to decreased trapped gas and hyperinflation, and allow the chest to resume normal shape and muscle capacity, resulting in better lung function and decreased dyspnea.</p><p>A preclinical study using explanted emphysematous lungs found that expiratory airflow almost doubled with placement of five stents and was approximately 50 percent greater than control with three stents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-copd-bronchoscopic-treatment-of-emphysema/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. In an animal model, most airway bypass stents became occluded within one week, so drug eluting stents were developed, first <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mitomycin</a> and then <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paclitaxel</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-copd-bronchoscopic-treatment-of-emphysema/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>].</p><p>The airway bypass procedure is performed under general anesthesia using a flexible bronchoscope. First, the bronchoscope is passed to an area of known emphysema and a Doppler probe is used to identify a segmental bronchus that is free of blood vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-copd-bronchoscopic-treatment-of-emphysema/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Next, a special transbronchial balloon dilation needle is passed through the wall of the bronchus into the adjacent alveolus, creating a fenestration. Finally, a delivery catheter carrying a drug-eluting stent is passed through the fenestration, and the stent is deployed to maintain patency of the fenestration. </p><p>Despite evidence of benefit in a preliminary study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-copd-bronchoscopic-treatment-of-emphysema/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>], a multicenter randomized trial (Exhale Airway Stents for Emphysema [EASE trial]) that included 208 subjects with severe homogeneous emphysema did not demonstrate benefit in the co-primary endpoints (improvement in forced vital capacity or modified Medical Research Council dyspnea scale) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-copd-bronchoscopic-treatment-of-emphysema/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].

As the main goal is to reduce dyspnea and improve quality of life, measures of dyspnea, performance of activities of daily living, and quality of life are key. Radiographic, static and dynamic lung volume measures should also be assessed, as these are objective end-points and as most devices aim to improve lung function by reducing hyperinflation.

Bronchoscopic lung volume reduction (bLVR) was developed to collapse areas of emphysematous lung in hopes of having the same effect on respiratory function as LVRS, but without the morbidity and mortality of surgery. (See <a href=\"#H12785482\" class=\"local\">'Rationale for lung volume reduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who might be considered for bLVR in the future would likely have to meet inclusion and exclusion criteria similar to those of the National Emphysema Treatment Trial (NETT) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F69501\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69501 \">table 1</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Proposed techniques for bLVR include endobronchial placement of one-way valves, plugs, and coils; biologic sealants; thermal ablation; and airway stents for decompression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emerging-therapies-for-copd-bronchoscopic-treatment-of-emphysema/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. None of these have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for treatment of emphysema. The use of plugs and blockers has been abandoned due to adverse effects. (See <a href=\"#H12785496\" class=\"local\">'Proposed techniques'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One-way valves have been designed for bronchoscopic placement with the idea that they will allow air and mucus to exit the treated area, but not allow air to re-enter. The endobronchial valve, known as the Zephyr valve, uses a &quot;duckbill&quot; mechanism that allows air and secretions to pass through a central orifice that opens during exhalation and closes on inhalation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F76276\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76276 \">picture 1A</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F64484\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64484 \">picture 1B</a>). The IntraBronchial Valve (IBV) is umbrella-shaped and expands on inhalation and contracts on exhalation to prevent air from entering the bronchus during inhalation, but allow air and secretions to pass around the device during exhalation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F55269\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55269 \">picture 2</a>).
