Alternatively, patients with renal tumors &lt;4 cm may be candidates for active surveillance, particularly if they have a limited life expectancy or significant comorbidities that preclude surgical intervention. (See <a href=\"#H1133245402\" class=\"local\">'Alternative nephron-sparing approaches'</a> below and <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'Active surveillance'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Radical nephrectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with RCC limited to the kidney, a radical nephrectomy results in a five-year cancer-specific survival rate between 80 and 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitive-surgical-management-of-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. However, patients are at risk for long-term renal dysfunction as a result of the procedure, with the reported risk exceeding 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitive-surgical-management-of-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Hospitals and surgeons doing a higher volume of nephrectomies have lower mortality compared with those institutions with lower volumes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitive-surgical-management-of-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>Radical nephrectomy consists of ligation of the renal artery and vein, removal of the kidney and Gerota fascia, and on occasion the ipsilateral adrenal gland. However, in the absence of high risk of local invasion of the adrenal gland, resection of the adrenal gland should be omitted because the incidence of adrenal metastases is uncommon (10 percent or less) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitive-surgical-management-of-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H107035807\" class=\"local\">'Adrenal gland involvement'</a> below.)</p><p>Early ligation of the vascular pedicle is important to prevent tumor dissemination at surgery. Of the various approaches described (eg, thoracoabdominal, extrapleural, and anterior transabdominal), we prefer the anterior transabdominal approach because it offers the ability to remove the tumor through a relatively small incision. However, with large upper-pole tumors, the thoracoabdominal incision may be preferable, allowing palpation of the ipsilateral lung cavity and mediastinum. In addition, this allows the exposure required to resect a pulmonary metastasis if it is identified intraoperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitive-surgical-management-of-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>].</p><p>A radical nephrectomy can be performed as an open surgical procedure or <span class=\"nowrap\">laparoscopically/robotically</span>. The choice of surgical technique should be based on patient-specific considerations (eg, tumor location and size) and the technical expertise available. Regardless of the technique, every effort should be made to remove the specimen intact [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitive-surgical-management-of-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In most institutions, laparoscopic nephrectomy has replaced open radical nephrectomy for many patients, especially if the tumor size is less than 10 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitive-surgical-management-of-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/2,13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,13-15</a>]. </p><p>The oncologic outcome with laparoscopic radical nephrectomy is equivalent to that with open surgery. As an example, in one series of 116 patients, there was no difference in cancer-specific survival at five years with laparoscopic versus open radical nephrectomy (91 versus 93 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitive-surgical-management-of-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Laparoscopic radical nephrectomy is associated with less blood loss and a shorter recovery period compared with open radical nephrectomy.</p><p>The first robotic radical nephrectomy was performed in 2000. According to a large United States database study, the percentage of radical nephrectomies performed robotically increased from 1.5 percent in 2003 to 27 percent in 2015; the use of robotic technology was not associated with a lower overall or major complication rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitive-surgical-management-of-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. On the contrary, the use of the robot for radical nephrectomy has raised concerns about higher cost, longer global operative times, absence of force feedback, and difficulties with conversion for vascular complications. In a systematic review, the authors found no advantage for robotic over standard laparoscopic radical nephrectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitive-surgical-management-of-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Although robotic assistance does not appear to offer any incremental benefit over conventional laparoscopic surgery in radical nephrectomy, such benefit does exist in partial nephrectomy. (See <a href=\"#H387391471\" class=\"local\">'Partial nephrectomy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H387391471\"><span class=\"h2\">Partial nephrectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with tumors &le;7 cm and those at risk for a significant loss of renal function should be managed with a partial nephrectomy if it is technically feasible. Partial nephrectomy results in similar oncologic outcomes compared with radical nephrectomy. In addition, it is associated with a significantly lower risk of chronic renal dysfunction. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitive-surgical-management-of-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/3,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,18,19</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Overview of the surgical approach'</a> above and <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Partial versus radical nephrectomy'</a> below.)</p><p>As with radical nephrectomy, both open and <span class=\"nowrap\">laparoscopic/robotic</span> techniques are utilized and result in comparable outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitive-surgical-management-of-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Although laparoscopic partial nephrectomy is technically difficult, robotic-assisted, laparoscopic partial nephrectomy has evolved as a technique that offers similar outcomes to open partial nephrectomy yet has the advantage of precision and maneuverability to minimize ischemia times [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitive-surgical-management-of-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In a meta-analysis of robotic versus open partial nephrectomy that analyzed 3418 patients, robotic partial nephrectomy had a longer operative time, but less blood loss, shorter length of stay, and fewer complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitive-surgical-management-of-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=robot-assisted-laparoscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Robot-assisted laparoscopy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H115569580\" class=\"local\">'Solitary kidney'</a> below.)</p><p>During partial nephrectomy, the kidney should be carefully examined to exclude a synchronous tumor. The importance of this was illustrated in a series of 112 patients with sporadic renal masses who underwent partial nephrectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitive-surgical-management-of-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. A second lesion was identified in 37 cases and eight (7 percent of the entire series) were malignant. In addition, conversion to a radical nephrectomy may be necessary based on intraoperative findings. For example, most urologists convert the surgery to radical nephrectomy in cases with renal vein invasion or sarcomatoid histology on frozen section. </p><p>For patients who are candidates for a partial nephrectomy, concomitant adrenalectomy is not routinely indicated. This was illustrated in a series of 2065 patients undergoing partial nephrectomy at a single institution, of whom a concomitant adrenalectomy was performed in 48 cases (2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitive-surgical-management-of-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. At final pathology, only 3 of the 48 patients (7 percent) had adrenal invasion or metastasis and three others had a separate adrenal neoplasm.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H89702150\"><span class=\"h3\">Significance of margin status</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A positive surgical margin does not necessarily predict recurrence.</p><p>The overall risk of recurrence is low, but there are conflicting data regarding the prognostic implications of a positive surgical margin, particularly in high-risk patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitive-surgical-management-of-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one study involving almost 1344 patients who underwent nephron-sparing surgery, surgical margins were positive in 77 cases (5.5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitive-surgical-management-of-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Compared with patients with negative surgical margins, those who had positive margins had equivalent rates of local recurrence-free survival (97 versus 98 percent) and metastases-free survival (95 percent in both groups) at five years. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another multi-institutional review of 1240 patients who underwent partial nephrectomy for localized RCC, positive surgical margins were identified in 97 cases (7.8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitive-surgical-management-of-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. A positive surgical margin was associated with an increased risk of recurrence compared with those with negative surgical margins for those classified as high risk (pathologic T2-T3a or Fuhrman grade III-IV disease; hazard ratio 7.4, CI 95% CI 2.75-20.34 on multivariate analysis). In patients with low-risk disease (pathologic T1 and Fuhrman grade I-II), no increased risk of recurrence was detected.</p><p/><p>Our approach is to proceed with surveillance following partial nephrectomy in all patients with RCC, regardless of the margin status. Other options would include repeat excision, completion radical nephrectomy, or thermal ablation. However, since local recurrence is uncommon, surveillance is the preferable option. (See <a href=\"#H30\" class=\"local\">'Posttreatment surveillance'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3085862568\"><span class=\"h3\">Role of frozen section</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who undergo a partial nephrectomy for RCC are at risk that surgery will not completely remove tumor and that positive margins may be identified at final pathology. Whether a frozen section should be performed in these patients is controversial. While a frozen section reduces the risk of a positive margin (and therefore, leaving tumor behind), the limited data suggest that performing a frozen section does not influence survival outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitive-surgical-management-of-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. </p><p>If an open surgical procedure is done, our approach is to perform a frozen section because it allows further tissue resection if necessary and increases the likelihood the entire tumor has been removed. When these procedures are being done laparoscopically or robotically, the opportunity to resect further tumor is more limited. In those circumstances, a frozen section is not usually performed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Partial versus radical nephrectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The oncologic outcomes reported for observational studies and one randomized trial appear to be very similar for those managed with partial nephrectomy compared with radical nephrectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitive-surgical-management-of-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/3,30-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,30-34</a>].</p><p>In the randomized trial, 541 patients with clinical stage T1 or T2 RCC were randomly assigned to partial or radical nephrectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitive-surgical-management-of-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There were 12 recurrences in 268 patients managed with partial nephrectomy (4.5 percent) compared with 9 of 273 (3 percent) in those managed with radical nephrectomy. The number of patients who developed distant metastases was low in both groups (7 and 6 patients, respectively).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The 10-year overall survival rate was lower with partial nephrectomy (76 versus 81 percent, hazard ratio [HR] 1.50, 95% CI 1.03-2.16), but only 12 of the 117 deaths in the entire study population were due to RCC.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25776916\"><span class=\"h2\">Retroperitoneal lymph nodes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our approach is to perform an extended lymphadenectomy for patients deemed to be at an increased risk for lymph node involvement (eg, tumor grade 3 or 4, sarcomatoid histology, T3 or T4 tumor, presence of coagulative necrosis) and in patients with suspected nodal metastases on preoperative imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitive-surgical-management-of-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. For patients with no preoperative evidence of abdominal node involvement and not at an increased risk of nodal metastases, we typically limit the lymphadenectomy to the renal hilum, as there is no apparent benefit to an extended lymphadenectomy. </p><p>The only data from a randomized trial, from the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) 30881 trial, evaluated 772 patients who were assigned to radical nephrectomy alone or radical nephrectomy with lymph node dissection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/definitive-surgical-management-of-renal-cell-carcinoma/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. At a median follow-up of over 12 years, there were no differences in overall survival or deaths due to cancer in the two treatment arms.

This size criterion was derived from studies in patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease, in whom preservation of renal parenchyma is critically important because of the high likelihood of additional subsequent renal lesions.
