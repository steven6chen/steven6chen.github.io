Management of patients with active rabies and prevention of infection are discussed separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rabies-immune-globulin-and-vaccine\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rabies immune globulin and vaccine&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=when-to-use-rabies-prophylaxis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;When to use rabies prophylaxis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-rabies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of rabies&quot;</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2006908\"><span class=\"h1\">VIROLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although it was initially thought that a single virus was responsible for all rabies cases, rabies appears to be caused by a number of different species of neurotropic viruses in the Rhabdoviridae Family, genus Lyssavirus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rabies/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Antigenic and molecular genetic techniques have demonstrated that several viruses within this genus cause diseases clinically similar to rabies. Genetic sequencing of virus can help to determine the probable vector of transmission, such as a silver-haired bat or a raccoon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rabies/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>The bullet-shaped, Lyssavirus virion contains a single-stranded RNA genome encoding five structural proteins. One of these genes encodes for an outer glycoprotein, which is a primary target for virus-neutralizing antibodies. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the gene that codes for the inner nucleoprotein enables the identification of the various rabies virus variants and their associated host species.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2006933\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2006958\"><span class=\"h2\">Viral tropism and dissemination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lyssaviruses have a predilection for neural tissue and spread via peripheral nerves to the central nervous system (CNS). The mechanism by which rabies causes severe CNS disease is unclear. Lyssaviruses may produce neuronal dysfunction, such as autonomic instability, rather than neuronal death. Oxidative stress caused by dysfunction of mitochondria in neurons and other cells of the CNS may also be a pathway leading to the abnormalities observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rabies/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>Viruses amplify near the site of inoculation in muscle cells and subsequently enter local motor and sensory nerves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rabies/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Each virion is surrounded by a lipoprotein envelope studded with glycoprotein spikes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rabies/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. After inoculation, these glycoprotein projections attach to the nicotinic acetylcholine receptors of the plasma membrane of muscle cells to enter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rabies/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The viruses then enter nerve cells. However, since neurons do not express acetylcholine receptors, other unidentified receptors may exist to allow cell entry.</p><p>Viruses then migrate centrally in a retrograde direction within the axoplasm of peripheral nerves at approximately 50 to 100 mm per day until reaching the dorsal root ganglia of the spinal cord [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rabies/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Rabies viruses then ascend rapidly up the spinal cord to the brain, initially infecting the diencephalon, hippocampus, and brainstem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rabies/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Centrifugal spread of viruses along somatic and autonomic nerves results in widespread dissemination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rabies/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Productive viral replication and shedding occurs in highly innervated areas, such as the salivary glands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rabies/abstract/7,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10</a>]. </p><p>Although many neurons are infected by virus, the neuropathological findings are quite mild compared with those caused by other infectious etiologies of encephalitis, such as herpes simplex virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rabies/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. As an example, on autopsy, findings include mild cerebral edema and vascular congestion. Microscopic changes associated with infection include perivascular cuffing with mononuclear cell infiltration and microglial activation; occasional neuronophagia (destruction of nerve cells by phagocytes) may be seen. Dense, ovoid, intracytoplasmic inclusions, (ie, Negri bodies), may be observed within neurons of the CNS in areas devoid of inflammation or degeneration. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2006965\"><span class=\"h2\">Host susceptibility to infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A patient's susceptibility to rabies infection is related to several factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rabies/abstract/10,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,12</a>]. As an example, a bite with prominent salivary contamination on exposed skin of the face and head is more likely to result in a productive infection than a bite through clothing where saliva may be absorbed.</p><p>Other factors that may increase host susceptibility to infection include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The virus variant</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The size of the viral inoculum</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The degree of innervation at the site of the bite </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Host immunity and genetics</p><p/><p>All mammals are believed susceptible to rabies virus infection, although species differ in relative susceptibility. For example, foxes, coyotes, wolves, and jackals are quite susceptible whereas opossums are relatively resistant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rabies/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2006280\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9913634\"><span class=\"h2\">Geographic distribution</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rabies has a worldwide distribution with few exceptions, including Antarctica, New Zealand, Japan, Sweden, Norway, Spain and some Caribbean Islands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rabies/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Rabies is found throughout the United States, except in Hawaii [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rabies/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Despite the development of the first <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rabies-virus-vaccine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rabies vaccine</a> in 1885 by Louis Pasteur, the World Health Organization estimates that worldwide between 30,000 and 70,000 people die of rabies each year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rabies/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Most of these deaths occur in developing countries because of inadequate control of rabies in domesticated animals. </p><p>In the United States, there were 83 human cases of rabies reported from 1980 through 2015, with an average of two to three reported per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rabies/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. Among these cases, 25 (30 percent) were related to imported rabies in people who were exposed to rabid animals in endemic areas (eg, El Salvador, Haiti, the Philippines, Afghanistan), and five cases were in tissue or organ transplant recipients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Transmission</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most rabies is acquired through exposure to saliva from an animal bite. In rare cases, rabies results from a non-bite exposure (eg, aerosolized virus in bat caves or in laboratories handling the virus), or transplantation of tissue or organs from a donor with unrecognized rabies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rabies/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>].</p><p>No transmission of rabies has been documented from infected patients to health care personnel or household contacts or by fomites or environmental surfaces [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rabies/abstract/13,14,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14,23</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-rabies#H4006599958\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of rabies&quot;, section on 'Infection prevention'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9913641\"><span class=\"h3\">Animal reservoirs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In developing countries, rabid dogs account for 90 percent or more of reported cases of rabies transmitted to humans. In the United States, canine rabies was responsible for most human deaths prior to the 1950s, but was largely eliminated as an endemic source by the 1970s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rabies/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. By the late 1960s, wild animals emerged as the most likely source of human exposure in the United States. </p><p>Rabies surveillance in the United States has identified the four major animal reservoirs as bats, raccoons, skunks, and foxes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rabies/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. The leading source for human cases has been bats, based up genetic characterization of the infecting rabies virus strain. From 1980 through 2015, bat strains of rabies virus accounted for 46 of 53 (87 percent) of indigenously acquired human rabies cases that were not due to tissue or organ transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rabies/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. However, many patients did not have a history of a bat bite, or only recalled being in the same vicinity as a bat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rabies/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p>Although small rodents, such as gerbils, chipmunks, guinea pigs, squirrels, rats, mice, and rabbits are susceptible to infection, rabies is uncommon in these animals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rabies/abstract/25,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,28,29</a>]. An additional discussion of the epidemiology of animal rabies is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=when-to-use-rabies-prophylaxis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;When to use rabies prophylaxis&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9913648\"><span class=\"h3\">Tissue or organ transplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rabies virus transmission can occur through transplantation of tissues or organs from donors with undiagnosed rabies at the time of tissue procurement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rabies/abstract/22,30-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,30-33</a>]. As an example, encephalitis developed in four patients who received a kidney, an arterial segment, and a liver from a common organ donor who died of encephalitis of unknown cause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rabies/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Immunohistochemical and direct fluorescence antibody staining demonstrated rabies virus in multiple tissues from all recipients. Histopathological findings in brain tissue from the transplant recipients demonstrated intracytoplasmic viral inclusions, suggestive of Negri bodies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F59999\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59999 \">picture 1</a>). Antibodies against rabies virus were present in three of the four recipients and in the donor, who had a history of a bat bite. </p><p>Pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis appear to reduce the risk of developing infection as illustrated in the following cases:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a series of rabies cases related to solid organ transplantations from an infected donor, all the recipients died except one who had a history of rabies immunization in the past [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rabies/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. During the course of the investigation, two additional patients who received corneal transplants were immunized against rabies and remained healthy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In 2015, two patients who received a kidney transplant from a donor who died of a rabies-like illness developed signs and symptoms of rabies 42 and 48 days after transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rabies/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In contrast, two cornea recipients who received post-exposure prophylaxis remained well for at least eight months.</p><p/><p>More detailed information on the use of rabies prophylaxis is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rabies-immune-globulin-and-vaccine\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rabies immune globulin and vaccine&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4962721\"><span class=\"h1\">INCUBATION PERIOD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The average incubation period of rabies is one to three months, but can range from several days to many years after an exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rabies/abstract/12,15,16,35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,15,16,35,36</a>]. As an example, in one series of 32 patients with rabies who reported a definite animal bite, the median incubation period was 85 days (range, 53 to 150 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rabies/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In another case, human rabies was attributed to an exposure from a dog in Brazil eight years earlier; viral latent infection <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> slow replication were hypothesized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rabies/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. </p><p>In transplant patients, the duration of time between transplantation of infected organs and symptoms in the recipient can vary. In one report, encephalitis developed in four recipients within 30 days after transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rabies/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In another case where rabies was transmitted from a donor to a transplant recipient, the recipient died from rabies 18 months after transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rabies/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p>The incubation period is shorter in patients with an exposure that occurs in richly innervated areas (eg, the face versus the extremities). Longer incubation periods may also be related to inadequate rabies prophylaxis, or an unknown new exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rabies/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4962713\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the patient has exhibited clinical signs of disease, rabies usually leads to progressive encephalopathy and death, with rare exception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rabies/abstract/37,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,39</a>].

This stage lasts from a few days to approximately one week [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rabies/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p>Paresthesias radiating proximally from the site of a known wound would be suggestive of rabies infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rabies/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The patient may describe a variety of symptoms including pain, tenderness, tingling, itching, burning, abnormal localized temperature sensation, or numbness at the site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rabies/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. In addition, percussion myoedema (mounding of the muscle at the percussion site) may be present during the prodrome and throughout the illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rabies/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4962794\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical rabies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infection may evolve into two major forms of disease including encephalitic (&quot;furious&quot;) rabies or paralytic (&quot;dumb&quot;) rabies, both starting with nonspecific prodromal symptoms as described above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rabies/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Encephalitic rabies is more common (ie, 80 percent of cases). </p><p>Occasionally, atypical cases have also been described in association with bat rabies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rabies/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Atypical features include sensory or motor deficits, choreiform movements of the bitten limb during the prodromal phase, focal brainstem signs, cranial nerve palsies, myoclonus, and seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rabies/abstract/8,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,43</a>].</p><p>The course of disease is heavily influenced by the extent of the bites, proximity to the head, and amount of secretions that were encountered. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4962763\"><span class=\"h3\">Encephalitic rabies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The classic presentation of encephalitic rabies includes fever, hydrophobia, pharyngeal spasms, and hyperactivity subsiding to paralysis, coma and death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rabies/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The following symptoms and signs are classic for this form of rabies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rabies/abstract/3,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,41</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hydrophobia is the most characteristic clinical feature of rabies, occurring in 33 to 50 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rabies/abstract/3,41,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,41,44</a>]. After some preliminary feeling of discomfort in the throat or dysphagia, the patient suddenly develops an overwhelming terror of water based on involuntary pharyngeal muscle spasms during attempts to drink. Later in the disease, even the sight or mention of water may trigger these involuntary spasms. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aerophobia is also pathognomonic of rabies although it occurs less often than hydrophobia (approximately 9 percent in one series) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rabies/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Pharyngeal spasms are triggered upon feeling a draft of air and can last approximately 5 to 15 seconds. Painful inspiratory spasms of the diaphragm and accessory inspiratory muscles can lead to aspiration, coughing, choking, vomiting and hiccups; when severe, these spasms can lead to asphyxiation and respiratory arrest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rabies/abstract/8,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,12</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The facial muscles may contract leading to a grimace and the neck and back can become hyperextended with muscle spasticity (referred to as opisthotonos). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Autonomic instability is observed in approximately 25 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rabies/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Signs of overactivity of the autonomic nervous system include hypersalivation, lacrimation, sweating, &quot;goose flesh&quot; and dilatation of the pupils. Hyperpyrexia alternating with hypothermia has been described. Tachycardia and cardiac arrhythmias are common and may be related to myocarditis from direct viral injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rabies/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients may exhibit dysarthria, dysphagia or may complain of diplopia or vertigo.

Intermittently, the patient may display symptoms of generalized arousal or hyperexcitability associated with disorientation, fluctuating consciousness, restlessness, agitation, and visual or auditory hallucinations. Patients may become aggressive and maniacal followed by periods of calm. </p><p/><p>The physical examination is notable for mental status changes, increased muscular tone and tendon reflexes with extensor plantar responses and fasciculations. Nuchal rigidity may be present. Once the patient develops coma, flaccid paralysis with generalized areflexia is usually noted.

Paralysis is usually most prominent in the bitten limb, and then spreads symmetrically or asymmetrically. The physical examination is notable for fasciculations; deep tendon and plantar reflexes are lost. </p><p>The patient may complain of headache and pain in the affected muscles with mild sensory disturbance. Nuchal rigidity and cranial nerve palsies are occasionally seen, while hydrophobia is unusual.</p><p>As the paralysis ascends, there is onset of dense paraplegia with loss of sphincter tone and subsequent paralysis of the muscles of deglutition and respiration, leading to death. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4962899\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with rabies die within two weeks after the onset of coma, although longer courses have been described with intensive care support [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rabies/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In addition, a few cases of survival after clinical rabies have been reported since 2004. </p><p>Patients often die of complications, such as asphyxiation and respiratory arrest secondary to muscular spasms or uncontrolled generalized seizures in encephalitic rabies or respiratory paralysis in paralytic rabies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rabies/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>Supraventricular arrhythmias, atrioventricular block, sinus bradycardia and sinus arrest with non-specific ST segment and T-wave changes have all been reported.

Paresthesias surrounding an animal bite site are suggestive of rabies. Before death, the diagnosis can be made by virus-specific immunofluorescent staining of skin biopsy specimens, isolation of virus from the saliva, or detection of anti-rabies antibodies in serum or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The clinical evaluation also centers on ruling out other often more treatable illnesses (eg, herpes simplex virus encephalitis) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F79957\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef79957 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rabies/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

Encephalitic rabies should be suspected based upon hydrophobia and aerophobia. (See <a href=\"#H4962934\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>In developed countries, some patients may have an unrecognized exposure (eg, to a bat) or were unaware of the risks of an exposure and did not receive postexposure prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rabies/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. In the 52 cases of human rabies reported in the United States between 1990 and 2006, approximately 50 percent were diagnosed postmortem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rabies/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The clinical diagnosis of rabies is more straightforward in developing countries when a nonimmunized patient presents after a bite by a potentially or known rabid animal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antemortem diagnosis of rabies requires several specimens (eg, saliva, skin, serum, CSF) and multiple testing modalities, since the sensitivity of any single test is limited. Serum antibody titers, for example, may not test positive until rather late in the course of illness, if at all. However, the sensitivity of a combination of tests approaches 100 percent, depending upon specimen quality, timing of collection, and diagnostic expertise. </p><p>The accuracy of testing various biologic specimens in the diagnosis of rabies was assessed in a prospective longitudinal study of 51 patients with encephalitis from Madagascar, Cambodia, and France [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rabies/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. A total of 425 samples (including saliva, urine, serum, and skin biopsies) were obtained during the acute hospitalization or postmortem. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing of skin biopsies was associated with high sensitivity and specificity (98 and 98.3 percent, respectively), followed by saliva (63.2 and 70.2 percent, respectively). The sensitivity of saliva specimens was improved to 100 percent when at least three samples were obtained. The overall sensitivity of urine and serum samples was poor. </p><p>The interpretation of antibody titers to rabies will depend on the specific specimen and the history of immunization. For example, serum antibodies to rabies virus may not be present until several days after the onset of clinical signs and may appear even later in the CSF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rabies/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. If no vaccine or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rabies-immune-globulin-human-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rabies immune globulin</a> has been given, the presence of antibody to rabies virus in serum is diagnostic of infection. A patient who has been immunized will have rabies antibodies in serum. Thus, in the immunized patient, a second specimen should be obtained a few days later to see if antibody titers are rising, which would be indicative of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rabies/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, antibody to virus in a CSF specimen, regardless of immunization history, suggests infection.</p><p>Routine analysis of the CSF does not distinguish rabies from other encephalitides.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9914422\"><span class=\"h2\">Sample collection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Collection of samples for the diagnosis of rabies in the United States should be performed only after consultation with the state health department. If, after the consultation, it is deemed necessary to send human samples for testing to the Rabies Laboratory at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), samples should be frozen, stored if necessary at -80&ordm;C, and shipped on dry ice by an overnight courier. </p><p>All samples should be considered potentially infectious, and handled and packaged for shipment with appropriate care.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rabies is caused by a number of different species of neurotropic viruses in the Rhabdoviridae Family, Genus Lyssavirus. (See <a href=\"#H2006908\" class=\"local\">'Virology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lyssaviruses are first amplified near the site of inoculation and subsequently enter local motor and sensory nerves. Viruses then migrate centrally in a retrograde direction within the axoplasm of peripheral nerves until reaching the spinal cord and brain. (See <a href=\"#H2006933\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Almost all cases of rabies are transmitted from rabid animals through a bite. In developing countries, dogs account for 90 percent or more of reported cases transmitted to humans, whereas bats account for most rabies cases in the United States. In rare cases, rabies results from a non-bite exposure (eg, aerosolized virus) or via transplantation of tissue or organs from a donor with unrecognized rabies. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Transmission'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Factors that may affect host susceptibility to infection include the size of the inoculum, proximity of the bite to the central nervous system, and host genetic variations. (See <a href=\"#H2006965\" class=\"local\">'Host susceptibility to infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The average incubation period is one to three months. (See <a href=\"#H4962721\" class=\"local\">'Incubation period'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prodrome consists of nonspecific flu-like symptoms, including malaise, anorexia, irritability, low grade fever, sore throat, headache, nausea, and vomiting. There may also be specific neurologic signs and symptoms at the site of virus entry that are suggestive of rabies infection, including paresthesias, pain and pruritus. (See <a href=\"#H4962773\" class=\"local\">'Prodromal symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An acute neurologic syndrome of either encephalitic or paralytic rabies follows the prodrome and typically lasts for two to seven days. Manifestations may include hyperactivity, persistent fever, fluctuating consciousness, painful pharyngeal or inspiratory spasms, autonomic stimulation (hypersalivation), hydrophobia and seizures. Paralytic rabies is characterized by quadriparesis and sphincter involvement. (See <a href=\"#H4962713\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atypical rabies, which is less common than either classic form, has been most often described in patients with bat-associated rabies. Atypical features include neuropathic pain, choreiform movements of the bitten limb during the prodromal phase, focal brainstem signs, cranial nerve palsies, myoclonus, and seizures. (See <a href=\"#H4962794\" class=\"local\">'Clinical rabies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical diagnosis of rabies is straightforward in developing countries when a nonimmunized patient presents after a bite by a known rabid animal. In developed countries, many patients have an unrecognized exposure (eg, to a bat) and diagnosis is often delayed. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Clinical diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Before death, the diagnosis of rabies can be made by virus-specific immunofluorescent staining of skin biopsy specimens, isolation of virus from the saliva, or detection of anti-rabies antibodies in serum or cerebrospinal fluid. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Since the sensitivity of any single diagnostic test for rabies is limited, antemortem diagnosis of rabies requires several specimens of saliva, skin, serum, and cerebrospinal fluid and multiple testing modalities, depending on the specimen type as described above. (See <a href=\"#H9914422\" class=\"local\">'Sample collection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis varies, depending on whether the patient presents with encephalitic or paralytic rabies. The evaluation for these alternative diagnoses typically includes brain imaging a cerebrospinal fluid analysis.
