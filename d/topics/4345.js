It is not necessary to identify a microbiologic etiology in children who are well enough to be treated as outpatients. Decisions regarding empiric antimicrobial therapy for CAP in children are usually based upon age unless there are other overriding epidemiologic or clinical factors to suggest a specific etiologic agent. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infants younger than three to six months of age with suspected bacterial CAP or who are hypoxemic should be admitted to the hospital for management. Afebrile infants one to four months of age who are thought to have afebrile pneumonia of infancy (eg, <em>Chlamydia trachomatis</em>) can be treated in the outpatient setting if they are not hypoxemic and remain afebrile. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumonia-in-children-inpatient-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pneumonia in children: Inpatient treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlamydia-trachomatis-infections-in-the-newborn\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chlamydia trachomatis infections in the newborn&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend that empiric antibiotic therapy for CAP in children six months to five years of age who are thought to have bacterial pneumonia (eg, abrupt onset, moderate to severe respiratory distress, and supportive laboratory data if obtained (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52021\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52021 \">table 3</a>)) include coverage for <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae </em>(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F80561\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80561 \">table 2</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Children &lt;5 years'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We initiate macrolide antibiotics for initial empiric therapy for suspected atypical CAP (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52021\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52021 \">table 3</a>) in children &ge;5 years who are treated as outpatients. For children &ge;5 years with clinical features strongly suggestive of typical bacterial or <em>S. pneumoniae</em> pneumonia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52021\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52021 \">table 3</a>), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">amoxicillin</a> remains the drug of choice (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F80561\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80561 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Children &ge;5 years'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In infants and children six months and older, the usual duration of antimicrobial therapy is five days for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">azithromycin</a> and 7 to 10 days for other agents. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Duration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children who are treated for CAP as outpatients should have follow-up within 24 to 48 hours. Those whose condition has worsened at follow-up should be evaluated for potential complications and hospitalized. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring response'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumonia-in-children-inpatient-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pneumonia in children: Inpatient treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children recovering from CAP may continue to cough for several weeks to four months, depending upon the etiology. Those recovering from typical or atypical bacterial pneumonia may have moderate dyspnea on exertion for two to three months. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Clinical course'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Follow-up radiographs in children with uncomplicated CAP who remain asymptomatic are not needed. Follow-up radiographs two to three weeks after completion of therapy may be helpful in children with recurrent pneumonia, persistent symptoms, severe atelectasis, unusually located infiltrates, or round pneumonia. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Radiographs'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most otherwise healthy children who develop pneumonia recover without any long-term sequelae. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/community-acquired-pneumonia-in-children-outpatient-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Bradley JS, Byington CL, Shah SS, et al.
