In healthy individuals, the pericardial cavity contains 15 to 50 mL of an ultrafiltrate of plasma. Pericardial diseases are relatively common in clinical practice and may have different presentations either as isolated disease or as a manifestation of a systemic disorder. </p><p>Although the etiology is varied and complex, the pericardium has a relatively non-specific response to these different causes with inflammation of the pericardial layers and possible increased production of pericardial fluid. Chronic inflammation with fibrosis and calcification can lead to a rigid, usually thickened and calcified pericardium, with possible progression to pericardial constriction. In some cases, the clinical presentation of acute pericardial inflammation predominates, and the presence of excess pericardial fluid is clinically unimportant. In other cases, the effusion and its clinical consequences (ie, cardiac tamponade and constrictive pericarditis) are of primary importance.</p><p>Diseases of the pericardium present clinically in one of several ways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-pericardial-disease/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute and recurrent pericarditis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pericardial effusion without major hemodynamic compromise</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac tamponade</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Constrictive pericarditis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Effusive-constrictive pericarditis</p><p/><p>This topic will provide a brief overview of the major causes of pericardial disease.

However, in the absence of cardiac tamponade, most patients with a pericardial effusion have no symptoms specific to the effusion, but may have symptoms related to the underlying cause (eg, fever in the setting of pericarditis, etc). Thus, pericardial effusions are often discovered incidentally during evaluation of other cardiopulmonary diseases, and are typically diagnosed by echocardiography. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pericardial-effusion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and treatment of pericardial effusion&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-tamponade\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac tamponade&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Several case series have reported estimates of the frequency of specific causes of pericardial effusion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F78847\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78847 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-pericardial-disease/abstract/9-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-13</a>]. Not surprisingly, the distribution of causes varies with demographics and diagnostic strategies. For example, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is more sensitive for the detection of infection than cultures; therefore, a study employing PCR will likely have an increased incidence of infectious etiologies. The increased incidence of iatrogenic effusions in the more contemporary series (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F78847\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78847 \">table 3</a>) reflects the growing number of invasive cardiovascular procedures being performed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Hemorrhagic pericardial effusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with hemorrhagic pericardial effusions have a different distribution of causes than those with serous effusions, although there is considerable overlap.

Patients typically present months to years after an initial insult involving the pericardium, although the majority of patients with prior involvement of the pericardium do not develop constrictive pericarditis. While the diagnosis of constrictive pericarditis is often made by echocardiography, patients commonly undergo cardiac catheterization, during which invasive hemodynamic evaluation is important to confirm the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=constrictive-pericarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Constrictive pericarditis&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2995900527\"><span class=\"h2\">Effusive constrictive pericarditis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pericardial pathology consistent with constrictive pericarditis with a concomitant effusion is called effusive constrictive pericarditis. Most cases of effusive constrictive pericarditis are idiopathic, reflecting the frequency of idiopathic pericardial disease in general. Effusive constrictive pericarditis is relatively uncommon (similar to constrictive pericarditis). The diagnosis of effusive constrictive pericarditis often becomes apparent following pericardiocentesis in patients initially considered to have uncomplicated cardiac tamponade. In such cases, the right atrial pressure remains elevated after removal of the pericardial effusion due to underlying constriction.

In two series with a total of 331 patients with acute pericarditis, a specific diagnosis was established in only 16 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-pericardial-disease/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. The most common were neoplasia (6 percent), tuberculosis (4 percent), nontuberculous infection (2 percent), and collagen vascular disease (2 percent).</p><p>In patients with acute pericarditis in whom no cause is identified (idiopathic pericarditis), the etiology is frequently presumed to be viral or immune-mediated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-pericardial-disease/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>], but evidence for this is usually not sought because of the expense involved, the inaccessibility of pericardial <span class=\"nowrap\">tissue/fluid,</span> and the time delay and inaccuracy of viral titers. It is possible that many cases in which an identifiable cause exists are labeled &quot;idiopathic pericarditis&quot; as a result of an insufficiently rigorous diagnostic evaluation. However, a complex and exhaustive testing strategy is typically not justified in such patients given the limited implications for clinical management. One clinically important exception to this approach is the absence of a prompt and adequate response to standard treatment, in which case more aggressive efforts at establishing a diagnosis are warranted.</p><p><span class=\"nowrap\">Epicardial/pericardial</span> biopsy using pericardioscopy has improved the diagnostic yield, but it is not widely available. It may be useful for relapsing cardiac tamponade, suspected bacterial or neoplastic pericarditis, worsening pericarditis without a definitive diagnosis despite medical treatment, and symptomatic moderate to large pericardial effusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-pericardial-disease/abstract/2,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">INFECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Virtually any infectious organism can infect the pericardium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F67851\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67851 \">table 1</a>).

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=purulent-pericarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Purulent pericarditis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The frequency of specific pathogens in infectious pericardial disease has been changing in recent decades and continues to vary with geography. Tuberculous pericarditis has become much less common in developed countries, while HIV infection remains an important cause of pericardial disease in the developing world.</p><p>The clinical manifestations are often confined to the pericardium, as in viral pericarditis, but extrapericardial infection may be a prominent component of the clinical picture, as in pneumonia or empyema with associated pericardial involvement. In some cases, particularly with tuberculous or fungal infection, an infectious pericarditis can result in chronic constrictive pericarditis.

An exception to this may be patients with HIV, in whom pericardial effusion seems more prevalent. However, this high frequency may well be decreasing as more and more patients infected with HIV are receiving aggressive therapy.

Symptomatic pericarditis can occur with all of these disorders, while pericardial effusion, when present, is usually clinically silent. This is most likely to occur in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and rheumatoid arthritis. In SLE, for example, the pericardium is involved in almost one-half of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-pericardial-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=non-coronary-cardiac-manifestations-of-systemic-lupus-erythematosus-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Non-coronary cardiac manifestations of systemic lupus erythematosus in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Uremia and dialysis</strong> &ndash; Important causes of metabolic pericardial disease are uremia (which causes pericarditis in 6 to 10 percent of patients with advanced renal failure who are not being dialyzed) and dialysis-related pericardial effusion (occurring in approximately 13 percent of patients). Both inadequate dialysis (ie, uremic pericarditis) and fluid overload may contribute to the latter disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-pericardial-disease/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. An important clinical feature of uremic pericarditis is that the electrocardiogram does not usually show typical diffuse ST elevation, presumably because epicardial injury is uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-pericardial-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The presence of ST-T abnormalities suggests some other cause for the pericarditis.

The effusion is typically slow to accumulate, which frequently results in a large (hundreds of milliliters) effusion, which is rarely hemodynamically significant.
