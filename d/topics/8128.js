The liver is a big organ in the upper right side of the belly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F64960\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64960 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Hepatitis A is caused by a virus. When people have hepatitis A, the virus leaves their body in their bowel movements. If infected people do not wash their hands after they use the bathroom, they can have the virus on their hands. Then they can spread the virus to anything they touch, including food, water, and other people.</p><p>People all over the world can get hepatitis A.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29146080\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of hepatitis A?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In children, hepatitis A does not usually cause any symptoms. In adults, hepatitis A causes a flu-like illness that starts suddenly about a month after a person is infected.</p><p>At first, symptoms usually include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling tired</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea or vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having no appetite</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever higher than 100.4&deg;F (38&deg;C)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain under the ribs on the right side of the belly</p><p/><p>Later on, symptoms usually include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dark-colored urine</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Light-colored bowel movements</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Jaundice, which is when the skin or white part of the eyes turn yellow</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Itchy skin</p><p/><p>Rarely, hepatitis A can cause liver damage that can lead to death.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29146087\"><span class=\"h1\">How do people get hepatitis A?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People can get hepatitis A after they eat food or drink water with the virus in it. People can also get it if they touch something that has the virus on it and then touch their food or put their hands in their mouth.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29146094\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for hepatitis A?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. To check if you have hepatitis A, your doctor or nurse will do an exam and blood tests.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29146101\"><span class=\"h1\">How is hepatitis A treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most of the time, the infection will get better on its own. But there are things you can do at home to help your liver heal. You can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get plenty of rest &ndash; Do not return to work or school until your fever is gone, your appetite is back, and your skin and eyes are no longer yellow.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid drinking alcohol</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid certain medicines &ndash; Your doctor or nurse will tell you which prescription and over-the-counter medicines to avoid.</p><p/><p>In rare cases, people need to be treated in the hospital.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29146108\"><span class=\"h1\">When will I feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It can take a few months to feel better. Most people are completely better within 6 months of getting infected. Hepatitis A does <strong>not</strong> lead to lifelong liver problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29146115\"><span class=\"h1\">Can hepatitis A be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. To help prevent getting or spreading hepatitis A, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wash your hands after going to the bathroom, changing diapers, and touching garbage or dirty clothes. Also, be sure to wash your hands before preparing food and eating.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-a-vaccine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">hepatitis A vaccine</a> &ndash; Vaccines can prevent certain serious or deadly infections. Doctors recommend that adults get the hepatitis A vaccine if they have a higher than normal chance of getting the infection. This includes adults who plan to travel to certain countries or have certain medical conditions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Make sure that your child gets the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-a-vaccine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">hepatitis A vaccine</a> &ndash; Doctors recommend that all babies get the hepatitis A vaccine as one of their routine childhood vaccines.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pay attention to food safety (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F60529\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60529 \">table 1</a>):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Don't drink unpasteurized milk or foods made with it</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Wash fruits and vegetables well before eating them</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Keep the refrigerator colder than 40&deg;F (4.4&deg;C) and the freezer below 0&deg;F (-17.8&deg;C)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cook meat and seafood until well done</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cook eggs until the yolk is firm</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Wash hands, knives, and cutting boards after they touch raw food</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29146122\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I live with or was with someone who has hepatitis A?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you live with or were with someone who has hepatitis A, let your doctor or nurse know as soon as possible. If you never got the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-a-vaccine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">hepatitis A vaccine</a>, you might need to get it. Or your doctor might give you a shot of medicine to help prevent you from getting the infection.</p><p>You can catch hepatitis A from someone who is infected and is not yet having symptoms. You can also catch it from someone who has symptoms until the week after they develop jaundice (which is when the skin or white part of the eyes turn yellow).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29146129\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=staying-healthy-when-you-travel-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Staying healthy when you travel (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-travel-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines for travel (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-babies-and-children-age-0-to-6-years-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines for babies and children age 0 to 6 years (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-poisoning-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Food poisoning (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-b-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hepatitis B (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-c-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hepatitis C (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-a-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Hepatitis A (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-travel-advice-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: General travel advice (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
