The most common symptoms are itching and irritation of the vulva and around the opening of the vagina. Vaginal yeast infections usually occur as infrequent episodes, but can recur frequently and may cause chronic persistent symptoms.</p><p>Yeast infections occur mainly in women who are menstruating (having monthly periods). They are less common in postmenopausal women who do not use estrogen-containing hormone therapy and they are rare in girls who have not yet started menstruating. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">VAGINAL YEAST INFECTION SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common symptoms of a yeast infection include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Itching or irritation of the vulva and around the vaginal opening (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F53704\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53704 \">figure 1</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain with urination,</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vulvar soreness or irritation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain with intercourse</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reddened and swollen vulvar and vaginal tissues.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some women have no abnormal vaginal discharge. Others have white clumpy (curd-like) or watery vaginal discharge.</p><p/><p>Symptoms of a yeast infection are similar to a number of other conditions, including bacterial vaginosis (a bacterial infection of the vagina), trichomoniasis (a sexually transmitted infection), and dermatitis (irritated skin). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaginal-discharge-in-adult-women-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Vaginal discharge in adult women (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It is often not possible to know if itching is caused by yeast or other causes. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Self-diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">VAGINAL YEAST INFECTION CAUSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The fungus that causes yeast infections (named Candida) lives in the gastrointestinal tract and sometimes the vagina. Normally, Candida causes no symptoms. However, when there are changes in the environment of the gastrointestinal tract and vagina (which can be caused by medicines, injury, or stress to the immune system), Candida can overgrow and cause the symptoms described above.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">VAGINAL YEAST INFECTION RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most women, there is no underlying health problem that leads to a yeast infection. There are several risk factors that may increase the chances of developing an infection, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotics &ndash; Most antibiotics kill a wide variety of bacteria, including those that normally live in the vagina. These bacteria protect the vagina from the overgrowth of yeast. Some women are prone to yeast infections while taking antibiotics.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hormonal contraceptives (eg, birth control pills, patch, and vaginal ring) &ndash; The risk of yeast infections may be higher in women who use birth control methods that contain the hormone estrogen. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hormonal-methods-of-birth-control-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Hormonal methods of birth control (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contraceptive devices &ndash; Vaginal sponges, diaphragms, and intrauterine devices (IUDs) may increase the risk of yeast infections. Spermicides do not usually cause yeast infections, although they can cause vaginal or vulvar irritation in some women. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=birth-control-which-method-is-right-for-me-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Birth control; which method is right for me? (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weakened immune system &ndash; Yeast infections are more common in people who have a weakened immune system due to HIV or use of certain medications (steroids, chemotherapy, post-organ transplant medications).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pregnancy &ndash; Vaginal discharge becomes more noticeable during pregnancy, although yeast infection is not always the cause. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaginal-discharge-in-adult-women-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Vaginal discharge in adult women (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diabetes &ndash; Women with diabetes are at higher risk for yeast infections, especially if blood sugar is not well controlled.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sexual activity &ndash; Vaginal yeast infections are not a sexually transmitted infection. They can occur in women who have never been sexually active, but are more common in women who are sexually active.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">VAGINAL YEAST INFECTION DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To diagnose a yeast infection, your doctor or nurse will examine your vulva and vagina. He or she will also swab the vagina to get a sample of discharge, which will be examined under a microscope in a lab. Do not begin treatment at home until your doctor or nurse has confirmed that you have a yeast infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Self-diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with vulvar itching or vaginal discharge often assume that their symptoms are caused by a yeast infection and try to treat it themselves using over-the-counter medications. However, in one study, only 11 percent of women accurately diagnosed their infection; women with a previous yeast infection were only slightly more accurate (35 percent correct) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vaginal-yeast-infection-beyond-the-basics/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Diagnosing and treating yourself:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wastes money (on non-prescription treatment)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wastes time; you will not feel better until you use the right treatment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Can make you more itchy and irritated</p><p/><p>For these reasons, it's important to see your doctor or nurse to confirm that you actually have a yeast infection before beginning treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">VAGINAL YEAST INFECTION TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment may include a pill that you take by mouth or a vaginal treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Vaginal treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment for a vaginal yeast infection often includes a vaginal cream or tablet. You apply the cream or tablet inside the vagina at bedtime with an applicator. There are prescription and non-prescription treatments, so ask your doctor or nurse which to use. One, three, and seven-day treatments are equally effective. The length of treatment depends on how severe your infection is.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Oral treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A prescription pill called fluconazole (sample brand name: Diflucan) is another option for treating yeast infections. Most women only need one dose, although women with more complicated infections (such as those with underlying medical problems, recurrent yeast infections, or severe signs and symptoms) may require a second dose 72 hours (three days) after the first dose.</p><p>Side effects of fluconazole are mild and infrequent, but may include stomach upset, headache, and rash. Fluconazole interacts with a number of medications; ask your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist if you have concerns. Fluconazole is not recommended during pregnancy due to the potential risk of harm to the developing baby.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">When will I feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most yeast infections go away within a few days of starting treatment. However, you may continue to feel itchy and irritated, even after the infection is gone. If you do not get better within a few days after finishing treatment, call your doctor or nurse for advice.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">RECURRENT VAGINAL YEAST INFECTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Between 5 and 8 percent of women have recurrent yeast infections, defined as four or more infections per year.</p><p>There is no evidence that eating yogurt or other &quot;probiotic&quot; products containing live Lactobacillus acidophilus, or applying these products to the vagina, is of any benefit in women with recurrent vaginal yeast infections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As with initial yeast infections, it is important to correctly diagnose recurrent yeast infections. A woman who has frequent signs and symptoms of vulvar or vaginal irritation or itching should be seen by a healthcare provider to ensure that her symptoms are caused by yeast rather than other common problems (eg, other vaginal infections, allergic reaction or sensitivity, eczema). As with initial infections, self-diagnosis is not accurate enough to recommend treatment.</p><p>Most vaginal yeast infections are caused by a fungus called Candida albicans. Persistent or recurrent infections may be due to infection with one of the less common species of Candida, such as Candida glabrata or Candida krusei. In women with recurrent or persistent symptoms, vaginal cultures should always be obtained to confirm the diagnosis and identify these less common species, if present, since different medications are used to treat these infections. This involves testing a sample of vaginal discharge in a lab.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with persistent symptoms are usually given a longer course of treatment for infections. This might involve several doses of fluconazole taken a few days apart, followed by weekly doses for the next six months.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment of a sexual partner</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vaginal yeast infection is not a sexually transmitted infection, although the infection may rarely be passed from one partner to another. Experts do not recommend treatment of a sexual partner.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2489383\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sporadic attacks of vulvovaginal candidiasis usually occur without an identifiable precipitating factor. Nevertheless, a number of factors predispose to symptomatic infection:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diabetes mellitus &ndash; Women with diabetes mellitus who have poor glycemic (blood sugar) control are more prone to vulvovaginal candidiasis than women whose blood sugar is normal. Maintaining good glycemic control can help to prevent vaginal infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotics &ndash; One-quarter to one-third of women are prone to vulvovaginal candidiasis during or after taking broad spectrum antibiotics. These drugs inhibit normal bacterial flora, which favors growth of potential pathogens such as candida. In women susceptible to symptomatic yeast infections with antibiotic therapy, a dose of oral fluconazole at the start and end of antibiotic therapy may prevent postantibiotic vulvovaginitis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased estrogen levels &ndash; Vulvovaginal candidiasis appears to occur more often in the setting of increased estrogen levels, such as oral contraceptive use (especially when estrogen dose is high), pregnancy, and estrogen therapy, including topical or intravaginal estrogen therapy by postmenopausal women. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunosuppression &ndash; Candidal infections are more common people whose immune system is weaker than normal, such as those who take corticosteroids or have HIV infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contraceptive devices &ndash; Vaginal sponges, diaphragms, and intrauterine devices (IUDs) have been associated with vulvovaginal candidiasis, but not consistently. Spermicides are not associated with candida infection.</p><p/><p>There is no good evidence showing a link between vulvovaginal candidiasis and hygienic habits or wearing tight or synthetic clothing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vaginal yeast infections are a common problem in women.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Itching is the most common symptom of a vaginal yeast infection.
