Conservative care includes preventive care, and joint protection is a fundamental way to provide preventive joint care.</p><p>Joint protection for the upper limb is reviewed here. An overview of joint protection and the application of the principles of joint protection to the neck and lower limb are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-joint-protection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of joint protection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=joint-protection-program-for-the-neck\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Joint protection program for the neck&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=joint-protection-program-for-the-lower-limb\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Joint protection program for the lower limb&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PRINCIPLES OF JOINT PROTECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>These principles are derived from the simple, practical application of proper body mechanics, posture, and positioning of joints. Joint protection reduces local joint stress and preserves joint integrity. Joint protection is achieved through patient education, self-management, and problem-solving to promote behavior modification; energy conservation; exercise; and selective use of splints, adaptive devices, and modalities. Guiding patients to perform tasks in a manner that reduces stress on joints is generally preferred to prohibiting the task. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-joint-protection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of joint protection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Principles of joint protection include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Respect pain.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Balance rest and activity.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Participate in exercise or activity to maintain strength and range of motion.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use the minimum amount of force necessary to complete the job.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Simplify work.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use good posture and body mechanics and avoid positions which induce deformity.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Distribute the load over stronger joints <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> larger surface areas.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid maintaining the same joint position for prolonged periods.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">IDENTIFYING AGGRAVATING FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aggravating factors may be present when pain persists beyond the expected duration for a given problem, such as bursitis or tendinitis. Such factors include habits and activities that can initiate <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> perpetuate soft tissue or joint pain and disability. The patient's routine at work, at home, and in sports should be explored as the starting point for the identification of such factors so that the patient can appropriately modify their activities as a preventive strategy. Knowledge of specific risk factors for specific sports or activities can direct prevention recommendations. For swimming, risk factors with a moderate level of certainty for shoulder pain and injury include clinical joint laxity, instability, <span class=\"nowrap\">internal/external</span> rotation, previous history of pain and injury, and higher competitive level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-protection-program-for-the-upper-limb/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The patient's occupation can predispose to musculoskeletal issues. As an example, in a meta-analysis of dentists in India, 68.3 percent reported musculoskeletal problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-protection-program-for-the-upper-limb/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

The principles of joint protection derive from the practical application of proper body mechanics, posture, and positioning of joints to reduce local joint stress and, thus, to preserve joint integrity. These principles include (see <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Principles of joint protection'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Respect pain.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Balance rest and activity.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Participate in exercise or activity to maintain strength and range of motion.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Use the minimum amount of force necessary to complete the job.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Simplify work.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Use good posture and body mechanics and avoid positions which induce deformity.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Distribute the load over stronger joints <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> larger surface areas.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Avoid maintaining the same joint position for prolonged periods.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients in whom pain persists beyond the expected duration for a given problem, such as bursitis or tendinitis, the clinician should elicit information regarding habits and activities that can initiate <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> perpetuate soft tissue rheumatic pain and disability. Such aggravating factors, typically at work, at home, or in sports, may include new activities, increased intensity of use of the affected area, and psychological or social factors affecting use.
