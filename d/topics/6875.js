The volume in this venous reservoir is determined by the inflow from venous return from the upper and lower parts of the body and the outflow through the right atrium to the right ventricle. </p><p>The visual appreciation of the extent of jugular venous distention and the characteristics of the pressure waves are dependent on clear understanding and appreciation of the anatomic relations of the vein to fixed anatomic structures in the neck (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F111973\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef111973 \">figure 1</a>). The internal jugular vein (IJV) is formed by the joining of the inferior petrosal sinus and the sigmoid sinus at the base of the brain and exits the skull via the jugular foramen. The IJV then descends vertically within the carotid sheath, lateral to the internal carotid artery and common carotid artery and deep to the sternocleidomastoid. The IJV joins the subclavian vein to form the brachiocephalic vein at the base of the neck (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F111973\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef111973 \">figure 1</a>). </p><p>The external jugular vein (EJV) is formed by the posterior auricular vein&nbsp;and retromandibular vein (posterior branch) posterior to the angle of the mandible (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F111973\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef111973 \">figure 1</a>). After formation, the EJV descends down the neck within the superficial fascia running obliquely across the sternocleidomastoid muscle and ending by draining into the subclavian vein.</p><p>Although there are valves between the superior vena cava and both internal and external jugular veins, elevated venous pressure can be transmitted through the venous valves. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3381421344\"><span class=\"h1\">USE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Examination of the jugular venous pulse is a standard component of the cardiovascular examination, although its utility varies among examiners and clinical settings.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3281748817\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Indications for jugular venous pulse examination include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common indication is to use jugular venous pressure (JVP) to estimate whether right atrial pressure (RAP) is high or low and to assess how RAP changes over time, including its response to medical therapy. (See <a href=\"#H2379743526\" class=\"local\">'To estimate right atrial pressure'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">RAP estimation is an important component of the evaluation of heart failure (HF). Since left HF is a major cause of elevated right heart pressures, estimation of RAP using the JVP can aid in initial diagnosis of HF as well as in detection of HF exacerbation. (See <a href=\"#H964462842\" class=\"local\">'To identify and assess heart failure'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation of jugular venous pulse is helpful in the diagnosis and evaluation of a variety of additional cardiovascular disorders including superior vena cava obstruction, tricuspid valve disease, and pericardial disease.

In some studies, the IJV was commonly not visible, while in others the IJV was generally interpretable. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some studies have found that clinical estimates of JVP tend to underestimate CVP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/examination-of-the-jugular-venous-pulse/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. This discrepancy may be caused by underestimation of the distance between the sternal angle and the central right atrium, traditionally assumed to be 5 cm, but imaging studies have shown that the actual distance varies with patient position and among patients, as described below. (See <a href=\"#H154272430\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The accuracy of JVP (by IJV or EJV) for detection of elevated CVP varies widely among clinical settings and observers (eg, sensitivity JVP by IJV for elevated CVP ranged from 14 to 86 percent in one review [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/examination-of-the-jugular-venous-pulse/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]). As examples: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In the ESCAPE trial, investigators skilled in the care of patients with advanced HF were usually able to determine if the RAP was &lt;8 mmHg (likelihood ratio 16.6) in such patients, and the area under the survival curve for their estimates of RAP &gt;12 mmHg was 0.74 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/examination-of-the-jugular-venous-pulse/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In a single-center observational study, examination-based accuracy of the RAP was greater for staff cardiologists compared with trainees (82 versus 67 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/examination-of-the-jugular-venous-pulse/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>],&nbsp;emphasizing the value of training and experience in estimating the JVP.</p><p/><p>The specificity of JVP for elevated RAP likely also varies with clinical setting. When an elevated JVP is observed, causes of elevated RAP as well as other causes (eg, superior vena cava obstruction) should be considered. (See <a href=\"#H588981019\" class=\"local\">'Causes of elevated jugular venous pressure'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H964462842\"><span class=\"h3\">To identify and assess heart failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many of the symptoms experienced by patients with HF are due to an elevation of the filling pressures of either the right or left ventricle (ie, the RAP or left ventricular end-diastolic pressure [LVEDP], respectively). The above cited review found that an elevated JVP was of value in diagnosing HF across clinical settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/examination-of-the-jugular-venous-pulse/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In a primary care setting, an elevated JVP had diagnostic value for detection of left ventricular systolic dysfunction independent of other clinical variables (odds ratio 15.1, 4.6 to 49.3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/examination-of-the-jugular-venous-pulse/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The JVP is the most important marker of the intravascular volume status in a patient with HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/examination-of-the-jugular-venous-pulse/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Indeed, in the ESCAPE trial of patients with HF, the only two findings from the history and physical examination which were associated with an elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP) were the presence of orthopnea or an elevated JVP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/examination-of-the-jugular-venous-pulse/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The JVP is an estimate of the RAP and is not a direct measure of the LV filling pressures (LVEDP). The left atrial pressure is generally a measure of the LVEDP and is estimated on right heart catheterization by measurement of the PCWP. However, in patients with chronic HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), the RAP and PCWP are often related; specifically, both are either elevated or not elevated (&quot;concordant&quot;) in 70 to 75 percent of patients with HFrEF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/examination-of-the-jugular-venous-pulse/abstract/5,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8</a>]. One study suggested a similar concordance rate in patients with HF with preserved ejection fraction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/examination-of-the-jugular-venous-pulse/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In the remaining 25 to 30 percent of patients, the RAP will not reflect the PCWP (called &quot;discordance&quot;), either being low when the PCWP is high or being high when the PCWP is low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/examination-of-the-jugular-venous-pulse/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In patients with a discordance of the RAP and PCWP, assessment of the LV filling pressures by an estimate of the JVP will be inaccurate. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3069063486\"><span class=\"h3\">To assess risk of progression of ALVSD to heart failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of an elevated JVP has prognostic significance among asymptomatic patients with systolic left ventricular dysfunction (ALVSD) and patients with current or prior symptomatic HFrEF. In a post-hoc analysis of data from 4102 SOLVD participants with asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction, presence of elevated JVP and presence of a third heart sound were independent predictors of an increased risk of progression to symptomatic HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/examination-of-the-jugular-venous-pulse/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>] during the 34 months mean follow-up. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2713072230\"><span class=\"h3\">To assess prognosis in patients with heart failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A retrospective analysis of 2569 SOLVD participants with HFrEF (or history of HF) found that an elevated JVP was associated with an increased risk of hospitalization for HF, death or hospitalization for HF, and death from pump failure during mean 32 months follow-up even when adjusting for other markers of disease severity including the LV ejection fraction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/examination-of-the-jugular-venous-pulse/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Among patients discharged from the hospital for decompensated HF, those who were free of congestion (which included an absence of elevated JVP) at their first follow-up visit had a reduced risk of subsequent adverse outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/examination-of-the-jugular-venous-pulse/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In a larger analysis from the EVEREST trial, subjects with evidence of clinical congestion (which could include elevated JVP) were at subsequent increased risk of death after a median follow-up of 9.9 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/examination-of-the-jugular-venous-pulse/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1974025845\"><span class=\"h1\">HOW TO EXAMINE THE JUGULAR VENOUS PULSE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H703751978\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach to examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The examination of the jugular venous pulse involves observing the patient&rsquo;s jugular veins at varying degrees of head and upper body elevation and with maneuvers to estimate right atrial pressure (RAP) and determine if there are abnormalities in the jugular venous wave form. (See <a href=\"#H2538072881\" class=\"local\">'Estimating right atrial pressure'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2365702310\"><span class=\"h2\">Which jugular vein to examine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The right internal jugular vein (IJV) pulse is generally preferred for assessing right heart hemodynamics since the right IJV and right brachiocephalic vein are in a direct line with the superior vena cava. </p><p>If the right IJV pulsation is not visible, then the left IJV pulsation may generally be assessed. The left IJV pulse may be less reliable for estimating RAP than the right IJV because the left brachiocephalic vein crosses the mediastinum and may be partially obstructed by mediastinal structures including the great vessels. Partial compression of the left brachiocephalic vein is usually relieved during modest inspiration as the diaphragm and the aorta descend and the pressure in the two IJVs becomes equal. However, partial obstruction of the left brachiocephalic vein from compression by the aorta may persist, particularly in relatively elderly patients, impairing transmission of RAP to the left IJV; this is the most common cause of unequal pressures between right and left IJVs. </p><p>We suggest examining the right external jugular vein (EJV) when the IJVs cannot be adequately visualized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/examination-of-the-jugular-venous-pulse/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. The EJV is more superficial, can sometimes be more easily assessed than the IJV, and can provide accurate results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/examination-of-the-jugular-venous-pulse/abstract/14,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,17,18</a>]. However, the EJVs are not in a direct line with the superior vena cava and connect with it after negotiating two almost 90 degree angles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/examination-of-the-jugular-venous-pulse/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-catheterization-techniques-normal-hemodynamics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac catheterization techniques: Normal hemodynamics&quot;</a>). The external jugular venous bulb is a site for thrombus formation, which can cause partial obstruction of the EJVs. It is therefore important to see a respirophasic component in the wave form in the EJV (rather than a static column) when using it to estimate the central venous pressure (CVP), for if there is a thrombus or obstructing valve or a kinking, then the height of the column will no longer reflect the CVP.

Suggestions for training include demonstration by a clinician skilled in this technique and examination of a broad spectrum of patients with normal and elevated jugular venous pressure (JVP). Once the basic principles of this examination are understood and practiced in a repetitive manner, the confidence in assessment of the jugular venous pulse improves significantly.

The degree of upper body elevation is the angle (0 to 90 degrees) at which the venous meniscus is best appreciated along the neck. The optimal angle depends upon the level of the JVP. Thus, it may be necessary to move the examination table or bed through various angles until the pulsation is visible. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Low venous pressures are best seen in or near a supine position (0 degree angle), while high JVPs are seen best with the patient sitting upright (90 degrees). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Since it is important to detect a high JVP, we suggest always inspecting the neck with the patient sitting upright at some point during the examination. If the JVP is seen above the clavicle when the upper body is elevated to 90 degrees, the venous pressures are likely elevated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/examination-of-the-jugular-venous-pulse/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. A high JVP may be missed in the supine position as the pulsation may be hidden high up in the neck.

(See <a href=\"#H515738517\" class=\"local\">'General approach'</a> above.)</p><p>The EJV can be identified by placing the forefinger just above the clavicle and pressing lightly. This will occlude the vein, which will then distend as blood continues to enter from the cerebral circulation. At this point, the vein should be occluded superiorly (to prevent distention by continued blood flow) and the occlusion at the clavicle released. The venous pressure can now be measured, since it will be approximately equal to the vertical distance between the upper level of the fluid column within the vein and the level of the right atrium (generally estimated as being 5 to 6 cm posterior to the sternal angle of Louis). </p><p>If the vein is distended throughout its length, the patient's trunk should be elevated to 45 or even 90 degrees until an upper level can be seen. In a patient with a markedly increased venous pressure due to right ventricular failure, the EJV may remain distended even when the patient is upright.</p><p>There are some limitations to the use of this technique:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The EJV may not become visible when it is occluded at the clavicle, particularly in those patients with a thick neck. If this occurs, it should not be assumed that the venous pressure is very low.

In this setting, there is an increase in the external JVP that does not reflect a similar change in RAP. This possibility should be suspected if the other jugular vein is visible and not distended or if an elevated venous pressure is found in a patient with no evidence or history of cardiac, pulmonary, or renal disease.

Gentle to moderate compression at the root of the neck obliterates the venous pulse in the neck, while the arterial pulsation remains visible. This maneuver is particularly useful for separating a very prominent venous pulsation from the carotid artery pulsation. Compression at the root of the neck may cause distention of the veins distal to the obstruction by impeding flow of blood to the heart, although pulsation will be absent due to blockade of the retrograde transmission of the pulse wave from the right atrium. When venous compression is released, jugular venous pulsations are often exaggerated for one or two cycles while the carotid artery pulsation is unchanged.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pressure in the neck veins generally decreases appreciably during inspiration, giving the impression of &quot;inspiratory collapse.&quot; By contrast, the arterial pulse amplitude does not change significantly during inspiration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The amplitude and location of the venous pulsation in the neck can be altered by raising the level of the head and trunk above the level of the right atrium (eg, sitting or standing), which reduces venous return and pressure, or increased by enhancing the venous return to the right side of the heart by raising the legs or compressing the abdomen.

If you are having trouble seeing any venous pulsation in the neck, reattempt in the supine (in case RAP is very low) and upright (in case RAP is very high) positions. Apply pressure to the right upper quadrant to see if that unmasks a wave form. Look at the neck both during inspiration and expiration to see if a pulsation changes. Confirm that you have looked at both sides of the neck and in the midline of the neck. Despite all of these maneuvers, if you still cannot see a venous wave form, then document that observation; in our experience, there are a minority of patients where the jugular venous pulse is simply not visible, undoubtedly due to anatomic variation or body habitus. In such cases, some have advocated looking at the collapse of the peripheral veins on the dorsum of the hand (or antecubital fossa) while the arm is slowly elevated passively from a dependent position. The CVP is considered elevated if peripheral venous collapse occurs above the level of the sternal angle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/examination-of-the-jugular-venous-pulse/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

The normal venous pressure is 1 to 8 cm of water (or blood) or 1 to 6 mmHg (1.36 cm of water is equal to 1.0 mmHg). Thus, a low value is consistent with but not diagnostic of volume depletion since it may be normal. Another important use is to distinguish the different causes of generalized edema: The venous pressure is elevated in heart failure (HF) and renal failure (due to volume overload) but is usually normal in cirrhosis (unless there is tense ascites) or nephrotic syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-edema-in-adults#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of edema in adults&quot;, section on 'Distribution of edema and central venous pressure'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H154272430\"><span class=\"h3\">General principles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The RAP is estimated by adding the height of the jugular venous column above the sternal angle (JVP height) to the vertical distance from the mid-right atrium to the sternal angle.

This approach is based upon a study of the vertical distance between the sternal angle and the level of the right atrium by computed tomography (CT) scan in 160 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/examination-of-the-jugular-venous-pulse/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Body habitus may also influence the height from the sternal angle of Louis to the right atrium. In a cross-sectional study with 52 patients who underwent CT, a positive correlation was found between patients' weight or body mass index and the distance from the angle of Louis to the right atrium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/examination-of-the-jugular-venous-pulse/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Thus, in patients with body mass index &gt;35 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup></span> (or body surface area &gt;2.5 m<sup>2</sup>), a jugular venous column height at the clavicle is likely to indicate significantly elevated JVP.</p><p>However, these limitations are generally not critical since the main value of JVP examination comes from determining whether the RAP is low or high and how it changes over time including response to medical therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/examination-of-the-jugular-venous-pulse/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. We therefore continue to suggest generally adding 5 cm to the vertical height of the JVP above the sternal angle when estimating RAP.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H588981019\"><span class=\"h3\">Causes of elevated jugular venous pressure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Elevated JVP generally reflects increased RAP but may also be caused by superior vena cava obstruction or increased intrathoracic pressure. Abnormal findings on jugular venous examination should always be interpreted in conjunction with other findings to establish the diagnosis. </p><p>Causes of increased RAP include restriction of right atrial and right ventricular filling (eg, cor pulmonale, pulmonary hypertension, constrictive pericarditis), right ventricular failure (eg, cardiomyopathy), fluid overload due to renal disease (eg, poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis), tricuspid valve incompetence, and tricuspid valve stenosis or obstruction. </p><p>The character of the venous pulse and associated physical findings may help distinguish elevated RAP from venous obstruction. When elevated venous pressure is caused by elevated RAP, venous pulsations persist. By contrast, bilateral elevation of the mean JVP in the absence of venous pulsation should raise suspicion of superior vena cava obstruction. Additional findings associated with superior vena caval obstruction include prominent distended veins in the upper extremities and in the upper torso with lateral thoracic veins draining caudally to the veins below the umbilicus.</p><p>It should be recognized that the JVP is also elevated by an increase in intrathoracic pressures. This effect is seen in the setting of positive pressure ventilation, a large pleural effusion, or pneumothorax [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/examination-of-the-jugular-venous-pulse/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3274582354\"><span class=\"h2\">Maneuvers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are three important maneuvers to perform when evaluating the JVP: positional changes, respirophasic changes, and the abdominojugular reflux. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1973016504\"><span class=\"h3\">Positional changes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The height of the jugular venous pulsation in the neck will vary depending upon the position of the patient&rsquo;s upper body relative to the horizontal.

The abdominojugular reflux is assessed by applying firm, sustained pressure for 10 seconds over the upper right or mid abdomen while the patient is breathing quietly. Normally, this maneuver transiently increases JVP (eg, a transient flicker for two to three cycles). With positive abdominojugular reflux (an abnormal test), the JVP will increase and stay elevated for at least 10 seconds of compression. A positive hepatojugular reflux is associated with the presence of an elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure of 15 mmHg or higher such as in patients with dilated cardiomyopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/examination-of-the-jugular-venous-pulse/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. </p><p>The mechanism for this phenomenon has not been clearly elucidated. Impaired right ventricular compliance may lead to an abnormal response to the increased preload caused by increased venous return and the raised diaphragm caused by abdominal compression and elevated intra-abdominal pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/examination-of-the-jugular-venous-pulse/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].
