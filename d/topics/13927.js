Infectious causes include surgical site infection, vaginal cuff cellulitis, pelvic cellulitis, infected urinoma, infected hematoma, septic pelvic thrombophlebitis, and necrotizing cellulitis or fasciitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posthysterectomy-pelvic-abscess/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Posthysterectomy pelvic and vaginal cellulitis have similar presentations to posthysterectomy abscess but are not associated with a pelvic fluid collection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinoma from a ureteral injury develops in the retroperitoneum; intraperitoneal urine collections are more commonly due to a bladder injury. The patient may become febrile and have pain due to an inflammatory response or because of infection. On imaging, the fluid collection has no debris or loculation, which are typical of an abscess. The patient&rsquo;s serum creatinine and urea nitrogen may be elevated from peritoneal reabsorption of the urine.

In a necrotizing cellulitis the affected area is usually erythematous (without sharp margins), swollen, warm, shiny, and exquisitely tender. Necrotizing fasciitis is associated with a thin, grey, dishwater-like wound drainage sometimes associated with gas formation. This infection involves the subcutaneous tissue and superficial fascia (Camper&rsquo;s and Scarpa&rsquo;s). It is rare for the deep fascia and muscles to be involved. Surgical exploration is the only way to definitively establish the diagnosis. Resection of all necrotic tissue is an essential element of treatment.

The use of intravenous contrast increases the diagnostic accuracy. The images often demonstrate a hypodense collection (between 0 and 30 Hounsfield units) associated with a round or oval peripheral intensification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posthysterectomy-pelvic-abscess/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. CT may be more sensitive and specific than ultrasound for detecting tuboovarian abscess (TOA), one type of pelvic abscess [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posthysterectomy-pelvic-abscess/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>]. In a review of three studies, sensitivity to detect TOA was 78 to 100 percent for CT versus 75 to 82 percent for ultrasound; specificity was 100 percent for CT versus 92 percent for ultrasound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posthysterectomy-pelvic-abscess/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Ultrasound is a reasonable alternative.

Intraabdominal abscess rupture is a life-threatening emergency and requires prompt surgical intervention (see <a href=\"#H2867719\" class=\"local\">'Surgical technique'</a> below). Clinical findings suggestive of intraabdominal rupture include, but are not limited to, hypotension, tachycardia, tachypnea, acute peritoneal signs, or acidosis. </p><p>These patients require aggressive fluid resuscitation, infusion of broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy (see <a href=\"#H321070309\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotic therapy'</a> below), and prompt surgical intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posthysterectomy-pelvic-abscess/abstract/11,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,26</a>]. In our experience, most women who are acutely ill will not improve without surgical removal of the nidus of infection. A general or trauma surgeon should be consulted. </p><p>Even in the absence of evidence of abscess rupture, surgical exploration and treatment are advisable in any woman with overt signs of sepsis and a large abscess. In women who are treated surgically, antibiotics should be started as soon as possible, either before or during the urgent operative intervention. In an unstable patient with the presumptive diagnosis of abscess rupture, surgery should not be delayed for the administration of antibiotics. </p><p>Postoperative care in an intensive care unit should be arranged as the patient may develop septic inflammatory response syndrome.

Multiple antibiotic combinations can provide such coverage for polymicrobial abscesses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F97485\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97485 \">table 3</a>). We typically use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=piperacillin-and-tazobactam-sodium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">piperacillin-tazobactam</a> at a dose of 3.375 g intravenously every six hours.

At that point, the patient may be switched to an oral regimen to complete a 14-day course of therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posthysterectomy-pelvic-abscess/abstract/21,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,26</a>].

In our practice, for patients with an abscess that is 7 cm or greater, we simultaneously start parenteral broad spectrum antibiotics and proceed to abscess drainage. Smaller abscesses may respond to antibiotics alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posthysterectomy-pelvic-abscess/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Studies informing this decision commonly include tuboovarian abscess (TOA) patients or general surgical patients; data are extrapolated to posthysterectomy patients.

All patients with abscess size &lt;2 cm responded to antibiotics alone. All patients with abscess size &gt;10 cm required drainage. The mean abscess size was 4.3 cm for successfully medically treated patients and 7.3 cm for patients who subsequently required surgical intervention.</p><p>In a case review of 135 patients with tuboovarian abscess, 69 percent responded to antibiotic-only therapy and 31 percent required drainage or surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posthysterectomy-pelvic-abscess/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The average abscess size for successful medical management was 6.3 cm as compared with 7.7 cm for patients who required intervention. In a retrospective cohort analysis of 240 patients with pelvic abscess, 84 percent of patients were successfully treated with antibiotics alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posthysterectomy-pelvic-abscess/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The patients who were successfully treated with antibiotics had smaller abscesses than the patients who required drainage (5.9 cm versus 8.5 cm). In our practice, if the patient does not improve after 48 to 72 hours of antibiotic therapy, then drainage (preferably percutaneous) is performed. If the patient&rsquo;s clinical condition significantly worsens while on antibiotics, then drainage is indicated regardless of the duration of antibiotic therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3931369\"><span class=\"h4\">Percutaneous drainage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Catheter drainage can be performed via ultrasound or computed tomography (CT) guidance with a transabdominal, transgluteal, transrectal, or transvaginal approach (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F98238\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef98238 \">image 1</a>). The approach depends on operator experience and abscess location; a transabdominal approach is used for abscesses in the upper pelvis or abdomen, and a transvaginal approach is used for deeper pelvic abscesses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posthysterectomy-pelvic-abscess/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. CT guidance provides better spatial and contrast resolution for accurate localization of the collection and the detection of adjacent nerves and vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posthysterectomy-pelvic-abscess/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Drained fluid should be sent for Gram stain, culture, and sensitivity.

There is no clear guideline regarding duration of catheter drainage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posthysterectomy-pelvic-abscess/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. There does not appear to be a benefit to the use of suction or irrigation of these catheters, although flushing once per day with saline ensures patency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posthysterectomy-pelvic-abscess/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Patients should defervesce within 48 hours of catheter insertion. Repeat imaging is done at approximately five to seven days to ensure shrinkage of the abscess. Criteria for removal of the drain include (1) clinical resolution of septic parameters, including patient well-being, normal temperature, and leukocyte count; (2) minimal drainage from the catheter; and (3) imaging evidence of abscess resolution.</p><p>Prior to the availability of modern imaging-guided drainage procedures, gynecologists drained pelvic abscesses transvaginally through a posterior colpotomy. Colpotomy is an appropriate option for posthysterectomy vaginal cuff abscesses that bulge into the vaginal space. However, reports have highlighted occasional onset of peritonitis and sepsis after use of this approach for drainage of a tuboovarian abscess [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posthysterectomy-pelvic-abscess/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Thus, in most women with abscess in the upper pelvis, this approach should be avoided.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3931413\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Failure of combination treatment (antibiotics and percutaneous drainage) can be defined by persistent fever, leukocytosis, and pain, and lack of resolution of the abscess on imaging. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2867700\"><span class=\"h3\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk factors for treatment failure include residual fluid collection after initial drainage and increasing patient age. In a study of 81 general surgical patients, all of whom had postoperative abscesses treated with percutaneous drainage and antibiotics, 18 patients (22 percent) needed subsequent surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posthysterectomy-pelvic-abscess/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Residual fluid collection after the attempted drainage was the single predictor of failure after univariate and multivariate analysis. In a retrospective review of 122 TOA patients, maximal leukocyte count, increasing age, and parity were associated with treatment failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posthysterectomy-pelvic-abscess/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2867706\"><span class=\"h3\">Management approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Culture and sensitivity results should be reviewed to ensure the patient is receiving appropriate antibiotic treatment; consultation with an infectious disease specialist may be helpful (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antimicrobial-approach-to-intra-abdominal-infections-in-adults#H939068497\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antimicrobial approach to intra-abdominal infections in adults&quot;, section on 'Introduction'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antimicrobial-approach-to-intra-abdominal-infections-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antimicrobial approach to intra-abdominal infections in adults&quot;</a>). A second percutaneous drainage procedure is reasonable for stable patients with a persistent fluid collection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posthysterectomy-pelvic-abscess/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. However, in hemodynamically unstable patients or those who have undergone two prior percutaneous drainage attempts, surgical drainage is warranted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2867719\"><span class=\"h3\">Surgical technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical abscess drainage is performed in hemodynamically unstable patients and those who fail antibiotic therapy or percutaneous drainage. Surgery is technically challenging because of anatomic distortion, extensive adhesions, necrosis, and inflammation, which may thicken the peritoneum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posthysterectomy-pelvic-abscess/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In our practice, most of these patients are explored through a vertical midline incision in order to ensure adequate exposure. However, in select stable patients without abscess rupture, laparoscopy appears to be safe and, in such cases, may have improved outcomes compared with laparotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posthysterectomy-pelvic-abscess/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8064445\"><span class=\"h4\">Procedure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The importance of involvement of experienced gynecologic surgeons cannot be overstated. Regardless of approach, surgical cases involving pelvic abscesses are notoriously challenging because of the anatomical distortion and friable tissue planes that universally exist from the extensive inflammatory process. It is not uncommon to also require the assistance of a surgeon experienced with bowel surgery. Appropriate preoperative arrangements assuring availability of operators possessing these skills are prudent. </p><p>Laparotomy is the surgical route used by most gynecologic surgeons for treatment of pelvic abscess. The decision of which incision to employ is important given the need for complete pelvic visualization. In our practice we use a vertical midline incision to allow complete exposure of the pelvis and abdomen. A Maylard transverse incision may also be used. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=incisions-for-open-abdominal-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Incisions for open abdominal surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The steps of surgical procedure for posthysterectomy pelvic abscess are the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Confirm the diagnosis of an abscess (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F98238\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef98238 \">image 1</a>) and arrange for appropriate surgical backup.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Upon entry into the peritoneum, anaerobic and aerobic cultures are obtained of the peritoneal fluid and the abscess cavity itself. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgically remove as much of the abscess cavity and associated <span class=\"nowrap\">infectious/inflammatory</span> fluid and debris as possible. If an ovarian abscess is diagnosed at surgery, surgical removal (adnexectomy) is generally performed because the ovary is typically necrotic.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Copiously irrigate the peritoneal cavity, thereby lessening the overall <span class=\"nowrap\">infectious/inflammatory</span> burden to the patient.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All removed tissues should be sent for pathologic evaluation and may be used for microbiologic evaluation as well. </p><p/><p>Given the high rates of wound infection from contamination of the surgical field (&ldquo;dirty wound&rdquo;) generated from abscess cavity disruption, we often use the following measures, when appropriate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posthysterectomy-pelvic-abscess/abstract/41-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">41-45</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Close the fascia with monofilament nonabsorbable or delayed absorbable suture, leaving the skin and subcutaneous wound open for at least the early postoperative period (72 hours). The wound can then be managed with a delayed closure procedure or can heal by secondary intention. Many gynecologic surgeons will opt for primary skin closure in such patients, and this may also be a reasonable option for women with extensive abscess surgery, although no direct evidence suggests the superiority of either approach. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-abdominal-surgical-incisions#H174061378\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of abdominal surgical incisions&quot;, section on 'Delayed closure'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Leave in a closed suction drain (eg, Jackson-Pratt) postoperatively until the patient demonstrates clinical improvement and the output from the drain is minimal.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8064773\"><span class=\"h4\">Laparoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some data suggest that a laparoscopic approach can be used successfully, primarily among patients with no evidence of a ruptured abscess [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/posthysterectomy-pelvic-abscess/abstract/40,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,46</a>]. In addition, a small case series has suggested improved outcomes while using a laparoscopic approach (compared with laparotomy), but definitive data are lacking. The choice between laparoscopy and laparotomy depends greatly upon the skill of the surgeon. Even in patients without evidence of rupture, a laparoscopic approach should be undertaken only by an experienced laparoscopic surgeon. Surgical treatment of posthysterectomy abscess is often a complex procedure given the extensive inflammatory changes impacting the tissues.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9281685\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Posthysterectomy abscess formation can be limited by optimizing preoperative medical management of patients, adhering to surgical guidelines for aseptic technique, and perioperative antibiotics. Bacterial vaginosis, if present, should be treated. (See <a href=\"#H9281641\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pelvic abscesses are polymicrobial, including both aerobes and anaerobes, as the organisms originate from the lower genital tract. (See <a href=\"#H9281626\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The typical presentation of posthysterectomy abscess is fever, tachycardia, tachypnea, and lower abdominal pain, days to weeks after hysterectomy. On physical exam, the pelvis is diffusely tender, and a fluctuant mass may be palpable in the pelvis or vaginal apex. Some patients initially present with sepsis or after failure to respond to treatment of pelvic cellulitis. (See <a href=\"#H1305033\" class=\"local\">'Patient presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of posthysterectomy pelvic abscess is based on clinical suspicion, palpation of a fluctuant mass, and visualization on imaging studies. In the absence of these definitive findings, pelvic abscess should be suspected in any posthysterectomy patient who presents with pain, fever, and leukocytosis. (See <a href=\"#H9281656\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Computed tomography or ultrasound imaging provides the definitive evidence of an intraabdominal abscess. (See <a href=\"#H3930807\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who are clinically unstable or have worsening clinical status may have a ruptured pelvic abscess and should have urgent surgical exploration in addition to parenteral antibiotics (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F97492\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef97492 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H432950681\" class=\"local\">'Hemodynamically unstable patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial antibiotic treatment is empiric and includes a broad-spectrum parenteral antibiotic regimen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F97485\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97485 \">table 3</a>). We suggest parenteral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=piperacillin-and-tazobactam-sodium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">piperacillin-tazobactam</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). In our practice we use 3.375 g intravenously every six hours (see <a href=\"#H321070309\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotic therapy'</a> above). The antibiotic therapy is adjusted if abscess drainage is performed and culture results become available. The initial treatment may be changed to a different broad spectrum agent as long as the cultured organism is sensitive. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients responding to parenteral antibiotic therapy are discharged on an oral broad-spectrum regimen (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> <span class=\"nowrap\">800/160</span> mg [double-strength] one tablet orally every 12 hours and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metronidazole</a> 500 mg orally every 12 hours), to complete a 14-day course of treatment. (See <a href=\"#H321070309\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotic therapy'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Larger abscesses are less likely to resolve with antibiotic treatment alone than smaller abscesses, but the optimum threshold for invasive intervention is unclear. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For initial treatment of abscesses &ge;7 cm, we suggest abscess drainage in addition to empiric antibiotic therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For initial treatment of abscesses &lt;7 cm, we suggest empiric antibiotic therapy only and do not perform drainage as initial treatment (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). If fever, leukocytosis, pain and lack of abscess resolution on imaging persist despite 48 to 72 hours of antibiotic therapy, we proceed with drainage. (See <a href=\"#H321071207\" class=\"local\">'Decision for percutaneous drainage'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who do not respond to appropriate antibiotic treatment (persistent fever and leukocytosis, lack of abscess resolution) require either percutaneous drainage or surgery.
