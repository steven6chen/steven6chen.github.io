In a study of 3602 patients seen in sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinics with genital ulcerative disease, 2088 had evidence of HSV-2 infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-drug-resistant-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

Most acyclovir-resistant viruses are TK-deficient strains, which appear less virulent in vitro than acyclovir-sensitive HSV. In addition, no person-to-person transmission of TK-deficient HSV stains has been documented [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-drug-resistant-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Rare reports of clinically important drug-resistant HSV disease have been documented in the immunocompetent host [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-drug-resistant-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]; however, among normal hosts, TK-deficient strains usually spontaneously clear without treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-drug-resistant-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Clinical drug resistance to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a> has been occasionally reported in immunocompromised individuals. As an example, in one retrospective study from a single clinic in France, only 13 of 5295 (0.2 percent) HIV-infected patients were diagnosed with acyclovir-resistant HSV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-drug-resistant-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Some experts suggest that the risk of drug resistance is higher in these patients because antiviral drug exposure is often prolonged due to slower healing of ulcerative lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-drug-resistant-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Thus, the laboratory confirmation of acyclovir drug resistance is an important finding in a patient who has persistent or expanding HSV-related lesions, despite adequate antiviral therapy. Such a finding would support the need for alternative treatment, which is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H28740862\" class=\"local\">'Management of drug-resistant ulcerative disease'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1909852\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among HIV-infected patients, risk factors for HSV drug resistance include a history of recurrent HSV infection, prior <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a> exposure (particularly if the patient was treated with a suboptimal dose), history of a non-healing lesion, and low CD4 cell counts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-drug-resistant-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28740813\"><span class=\"h1\">WHEN TO SUSPECT HSV-RELATED DRUG RESISTANCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Drug-resistant infection should be suspected among patients with documented HSV who have minimal improvement, or an increase in lesion size, within 7 to 10 days of appropriately dosed antiviral therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-drug-resistant-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Of note, recommended dosing and duration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a> and related compounds for the treatment of genital HSV infection is generally higher in the HIV-infected patient compared with the HIV-uninfected patient.

Routine baseline testing of all patients for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a> drug resistance is not recommended. </p><p>A variety of methods have been used to determine drug susceptibility of HSV isolates to antiviral agents. The most widely recommended test is the plaque reduction assay: an IC50 &ge;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> indicates that phenotypic resistance is present. This assay is preferred over other diagnostic tests, since a correlation has been established between in vitro <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a> susceptibility and clinical response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-drug-resistant-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/4,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,21</a>]. </p><p>Importantly, this test depends upon ability to culture the virus; thus, a sample for viral culture must be obtained. If there is any question regarding the underlying diagnosis, an additional sample can be obtained for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing, which is more sensitive than culture for documenting HSV infection. However, clinicians need to be aware that samples obtained for PCR testing cannot be used for resistance testing. Our institution sends samples to Viro-Med (1-800-582-0077) for the plaque reduction assay. Downsides of this assay include a long turn-around time (ie, 15 to 17 days).</p><p>Ninety&#8208;five percent of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a>&#8208;resistant strains have mutations in the viral thymidine kinase gene; the remaining 5 percent of acyclovir resistance is due to mutations in the viral DNA polymerase gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-drug-resistant-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Sequencing of these genes for genotypic diagnosis of acyclovir resistance may be performed in research labs, but this is not yet available for routine clinical use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-drug-resistant-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Of note, several of the recommended dosing regimens in the HIV-infected host are higher for acyclovir, famciclovir, and valacyclovir compared with the HIV-seronegative patient. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-type-2-in-hiv-infected-patients#H251515427\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of genital herpes simplex virus type 2 in HIV-infected patients&quot;, section on 'Treatment strategies for recurrent disease'</a>.)</p><p>Unlike in many other infections, daily suppressive therapy with nucleoside analogues reduces, rather than increases, the risk of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a> resistance in immunocompromised patients. This concept was well illustrated in a retrospective study of three consecutive cohorts of hematopoietic stem-cell transplant recipients (n = 2049), which received acyclovir prophylaxis for varying durations of time after transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-drug-resistant-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Cohort 1 received acyclovir for 30 days; cohort 2 received acyclovir for one year and cohort 3 received acyclovir for an extended period (greater than one year). The two-year probability of HSV disease was highest in the one-month prophylaxis group compared with the one-year and extended acyclovir prophylaxis groups (32 percent versus 4 percent and none, respectively). In addition, acyclovir-resistant disease developed in more patients in the one-month prophylaxis group compared with the other acyclovir groups (10 patients versus 2 patients and none, respectively). </p><p>These data in an immunocompromised patient population suggest that long-term use of suppressive prophylactic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a> may prevent the emergence of drug-resistant HSV disease. This point is critical, because withholding anti-HSV therapy to preserve future therapeutic options is more likely to lead to emergence of resistant virus compared with antiviral suppression of HSV reactivation.</p><p>In patients who have a history of acyclovir-resistant herpes, future HSV recurrences can be caused by either acyclovir-sensitive or acyclovir-resistant strains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-drug-resistant-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Because the risk of HSV reactivation persists, we suggest that patients with a history of acyclovir-resistant herpes be maintained on daily suppressive antiviral therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acyclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acyclovir</a> or a related agent. If herpetic ulcers recur, repeat resistance testing is recommended to determine whether acyclovir-resistant herpes persists. Dosing recommendations for suppressive therapy are found elsewhere.

A viral culture and a phenotypic assay for HSV drug resistance testing should be obtained and the patient should be switched to intravenous acyclovir (10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> IV every 8 hours). Lesion progression, despite intravenous therapy, would be suggestive of drug resistance. Clinicians should also be certain that the appropriate dosing regimens are being used.

Foscarnet should be continued until full lesion resolution. Patients should be carefully monitored for renal toxicity, bone marrow suppression and electrolyte abnormalities twice weekly.
