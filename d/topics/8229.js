Changes in physiological functions during high altitude exposure vary with an individual&rsquo;s physical fitness, rate of ascent, severity <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> duration of exposure, cultural habits, geographical locations, and genetic variation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-air-travel-and-heart-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. While high altitude is well tolerated by most individuals, patients with cardiovascular disease are at risk of complications caused by tissue hypoxia and reduced oxygen delivery, sympathetic stimulation, increased myocardial demand, paradoxical vasoconstriction, and alterations in hemodynamics that occur with exposure to high altitude [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-air-travel-and-heart-disease/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. The duration of travel, ascent profile, degree of exertion, and any prior cardiovascular history can each impact the health of a patient with cardiovascular disease who is considering traveling to high altitude.</p><p>High altitude provides a unique physiologic challenge to the cardiovascular system. The cardiovascular response to high altitude in both healthy individuals and in patients with cardiovascular disease will be reviewed here. A general overview of high altitude disease will also be included to provide a comprehensive understanding. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-altitude-illness-physiology-risk-factors-and-general-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;High altitude illness: Physiology, risk factors, and general prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Most importantly, this topic will discuss the impact of high altitude on the heart. Altitude exposure can also lead to a variety of well-described clinical syndromes including some not directly involving the cardiovascular system, such as acute mountain sickness (AMS), high altitude pulmonary edema, high altitude cerebral edema, and high altitude retinal hemorrhage. These maladies are discussed in detail within this report. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-altitude-pulmonary-edema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;High altitude pulmonary edema&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-mountain-sickness-and-high-altitude-cerebral-edema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute mountain sickness and high altitude cerebral edema&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-altitude-illness-physiology-risk-factors-and-general-prevention#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;High altitude illness: Physiology, risk factors, and general prevention&quot;, section on 'Other altitude-related illnesses'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">BAROMETRIC PRESSURE AND PIO2</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When moving from sea level to high altitude, there are reductions in atmospheric pressure, oxygen pressure, humidity, and temperature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-air-travel-and-heart-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. It is noteworthy to point out that significant changes occur beyond the critical height of 2500 meters (8200 feet) above sea level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-air-travel-and-heart-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Factors such as degree of change in elevation, degree of hypoxia, rate of ascent, level of acclimatization, exercise intensity, previous history of severe high-altitude illness, genetics, and age significantly affect the physiological change that the human body will experience during ascents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-air-travel-and-heart-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. One study involving Chinese men aged 18 to 35 years noted that increased age (those 26 to 35 years old) was an independent risk factor for acute mountain sickness (AMS) upon rapid ascent to high altitude (from 500 to 3700 m) and that the prevalence of AMS also increased with increasing age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-air-travel-and-heart-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Hypoxia induces peripheral vasodilation and a pulmonary vasoconstriction, leading to changes in systemic blood pressure and an increase in pulmonary blood pressure that can also contribute to high altitude pulmonary edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-air-travel-and-heart-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Although altitude is the most obvious determinant of barometric pressure and its resulting physiologic stress, other factors can contribute to a reduction in barometric pressure and can increase the physiologic consequences of altitude:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A decrease in temperature.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deteriorating weather, such as blizzards, hail, or extreme winds.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Latitude (distance from equator). Interestingly, due to a large mass of cold air in the stratosphere above the equator, the pressure at a given altitude at the equator tends to be higher than at distances from the equator.</p><p/><p>An understanding of barometric pressure, the primary determinant of the partial pressure of oxygen in inspired air (PiO2, in mmHg), is essential to understanding the cardiovascular stress of high altitude. The relationship between the PiO2, the fraction of oxygen in inspired air (FiO2), and barometric pressure (in mmHg) is described by the following equation:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p>PiO2 &#160;= &#160;FiO2 &#160;x &#160;barometric pressure</p></div></div><p>FiO2 is the same at all altitudes. As the barometric pressure changes, the FiO2 remains constant while the partial pressure of oxygen is altered with the change in barometric pressure. Specifically, the partial pressure of arterial oxygen decreases with altitude (hypobaric environments) and increases with depth (hyperbaric environments). In addition, oxygen within inspired air is reduced by the presence of water vapor obtained during transport into the lungs (typically 47 mmHg). As a result, the above equation can be written as:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p>PiO2 &#160;= &#160;0.21 &#160;x &#160;(barometric pressure &#160;- &#160;47)</p></div></div><p>The approximate pressures of oxygen in the atmosphere, inspired air, alveoli, and arterial blood at a variety of altitudes are shown in the following table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F63773\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63773 \">table 1</a>). At 2439 meters (8000 feet), which is the maximal allowable cabin pressure (altitude equivalent) in commercial airliners, the barometric pressure is decreased to 564 mmHg (compared with 760 mmHg at sea level). The net effect is a PiO2 of 108 mmHg, with associated partial pressures of oxygen in the alveoli and arterial blood of normal individuals of 69 and 60 mmHg, respectively. At sea level, the oxygen saturation is 99 to 100 percent. The oxygen saturation at 2439 meters (8000 feet) should be higher than 85 percent (approximately 90 percent) for a partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood (PaO2) of 68 mmHg based on the oxygen saturation curve. The partial pressure of oxygen in inspired air (PiO2) is greater than the alveolar and arterial pO2 at any altitude. This is caused by anatomical dead space in the respiratory system in which all inspired oxygen (air in the mouth and trachea) does not take part in gas exchange. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=traveling-with-oxygen-aboard-commercial-air-carriers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Traveling with oxygen aboard commercial air carriers&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">NORMAL CARDIOVASCULAR RESPONSE TO HIGH ALTITUDE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Information on the physiologic cardiovascular consequences of altitude exposure comes from both &quot;at altitude&quot; studies and those in which altitude is simulated in a hypobaric chamber.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Short-term altitude exposure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several circulatory changes occur within minutes of exposure to high altitude. Maximal aerobic exercise capacity is decreased at high altitudes due to a decrease in arterial oxygen content from decreased inspired partial pressure of oxygen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-air-travel-and-heart-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. This results in tissue hypoxia (hypobaric hypoxia) from inspiring oxygen-poor air, which causes compensatory physiological changes at high altitude both at rest and during exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-air-travel-and-heart-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>The initial response to hypoxia is an attempt to increase more oxygen delivery. The minute ventilate rate and tidal volume are increased to allow for optimal systemic arterial tension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-air-travel-and-heart-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Furthermore, the pulmonary arteries constrict in response to tissue hypoxia, a condition known as hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. This physiologic phenomenon occurs to redirect blood flow to alveoli located within areas containing the highest oxygen content. The hypoxic vasoconstriction ultimately leads to pulmonary hypertension and furthermore, an increase in the alveolar-arterial oxygen (A-a) gradient (the difference between the alveolar and arterial concentration of oxygen that is used in diagnosing the source of hypoxemia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-air-travel-and-heart-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The increased A-a gradient is caused by an unequal perfusion to the lungs from hypoxic vasoconstriction and is important in the development of high altitude pulmonary edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-air-travel-and-heart-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. For instance, after 24 hours, 15 percent of subjects develop pulmonary edema without symptoms, while 75 percent have an increase in pulmonary extravascular fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-air-travel-and-heart-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Sustained exposure to high altitude for &ge;24 hours results in the development of pulmonary edema. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-altitude-pulmonary-edema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;High altitude pulmonary edema&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Hyperventilation leads to a decrease in carbon dioxide and causes respiratory alkalosis. This leads to a shift of the oxygen-hemoglobin dissociation curve to the left, leading to the increased binding of oxygen to hemoglobin and thus less oxygen delivery to the tissues. Subsequently, after a few hours, there is an increase in 2,3-diphosphoglycerate that shifts the curve back to the right to improve oxygen delivery by facilitating the unloading of oxygen to the tissues. However, this makes it more difficult for oxygen to bind to hemoglobin in the lungs during gas exchange [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-air-travel-and-heart-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Oxygen delivery is the product of cardiac output and oxygen content. Given the reduction in oxygen content with increased altitude, cardiac output must increase to maintain the same oxygen delivery to the tissues. This can be achieved by increasing heart rate or stroke volume. Initially, at high altitudes, the cardiac output is augmented due to an increased heart rate and stroke volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-air-travel-and-heart-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Despite this effort, there is ultimately a lower peak cardiac output at high altitudes as opposed to at sea level. Such limitations are autonomic responses to limit myocardial oxygen demand and consumption during times of reduced oxygen availability. Over one to two weeks, the stroke volume is decreased from reduced preload and a lowered plasma volume from respiratory (hyperventilation), urinary (hypoxic diuresis), and cutaneous losses. Increased urine output is a response to high altitude hypoxia. Diuresis serves to increase bicarbonate losses in the urine to stimulate increased breathing. The increased urine output also serves to increase the hematocrit by 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> to increase the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood per unit volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-air-travel-and-heart-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Within hours of exposure to altitude, the red blood cell count begins to increase in response to an increase in erythropoietin. However, the overall buildup process of the red blood cell count is slow, taking months to reach equilibrium. As expected, the degree of polycythemia is related to the level of altitude.</p><p>The increase in the rate-pressure product (heart rate X systolic blood pressure), reduction in arterial oxygen saturation, and elevation in lactate concentration illustrate the potential oxygen <span class=\"nowrap\">supply/demand</span> mismatch observed with exercise at altitude [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-air-travel-and-heart-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Even though the cardiac output and rate-pressure product at a given activity level tend to be higher as altitude increases, paradoxically, the maximum attainable cardiac output, heart rate, and maximum attainable workload fall with increased altitude as discussed above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-air-travel-and-heart-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>In addition, after rapid ascent to a high altitude, the sympathetic nervous system is activated, which stimulates release of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-air-travel-and-heart-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. This shift towards sympathetic predominance during acute exposure to hypoxia has also been manifested by reduced heart rate variability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-air-travel-and-heart-disease/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-heart-rate-variability\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of heart rate variability&quot;</a>). The higher the altitude, the higher the arterial epinephrine concentration rises to enhance cardiac output, increasing bronchodilation in the lungs, and furthering vasodilation in the skeletal muscles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-air-travel-and-heart-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. This vasodilation counterbalances the escalation in cardiac output such that blood pressure changes do not markedly occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-air-travel-and-heart-disease/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p>Several changes are observed in the resting electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiographic-Doppler imaging for normal individuals exposed to high altitude. During ECG recordings taken from members of an expedition who climbed Mount Everest and achieved altitudes of 5335, 6250, and 7988 meters (17,500, 20,500 and 26,200 feet, respectively), the following ECG changes were noted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-air-travel-and-heart-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increase in resting heart rate (HR)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prolongation of the QT interval</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ST-T wave flattening</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rightward shift in the frontal QRS axis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increase in P-wave amplitude in lead II</p><p/><p>The last two changes are thought to reflect evidence of right ventricular and right atrial &quot;strain&quot; arising from hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension. At the most extreme altitude, 3 of the 12 patients developed a new right bundle branch block and three others showed changes consistent with right ventricular hypertrophy. Some of the ECG changes, primarily the increased HR, QT lengthening, and ST-T wave abnormalities, can be blunted with beta blocker administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-air-travel-and-heart-disease/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], suggesting a role for catecholamines in their development. Since virtually all ECG abnormalities abate upon descent, they are thought to not be clinically significant.</p><p>Another study of 456 subjects who performed a 20-minute hypoxia exercise test with continuous recording of ECG noted a dose-dependent, hypoxia-induced decrease in the amplitude of the P, QRS, and T waves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-air-travel-and-heart-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Echocardiographic-Doppler imaging studies of healthy men and women at rest after rapid ascent to high altitudes have noted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-air-travel-and-heart-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Threefold increase in mean pulmonary artery pressure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Altered right and left ventricular diastolic function</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prolonged isovolumic relaxation time</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintained right ventricular systolic function</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Improved left ventricular systolic function</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Long-term altitude exposure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After three to four days, the initial sympathetic nervous system manifestations of altitude exposure resolve as early acclimatization begins.

The sequence of events is as follows: at high altitude, the initial hypoxia and decreased dissolved oxygen in the blood stimulate peripheral chemoreceptors, which in turn in send signals to respiratory drives, leading to hyperventilation, leading to respiratory alkalosis, leading to shifts of the oxygen&ndash;hemoglobin dissociation curve to the left so that hemoglobin can pick up oxygen easier. Next, the kidney responds to alkalosis by generating hydrogen ions to correct the pH; after two to three days, the red blood cell 2,3-diphosphoglycerate level increases shifting the oxygen&ndash;hemoglobin dissociation curve to the right, making oxygen delivery easier to the tissues.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">ALTITUDE STRESS IN HEART DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The effects of high altitude exposure may have important implications for patients with various types of heart disease.

As a result, cardiac patients engaged in recreational activities at altitude should be warned about the signs of altitude illness; in certain circumstances, carry the appropriate prophylactic medicines such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetazolamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetazolamide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a>; and, lastly, follow basic advice about altitude illness prevention, most notably acclimatization (ideally for five days) with gradual ascent and proper hydration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-air-travel-and-heart-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In addition, patient compliance of current antianginal medications and treatment of their cardiovascular disease should be emphasized. Importantly, they should be advised that the quickest and most effective treatment of altitude-related illness is descent. Supplementary oxygen may also be beneficial in some individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-air-travel-and-heart-disease/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

It is essential that altitude be considered in the etiology of any symptoms and that the patient be advised to arrange immediate descent if decompensation occurs.

Acutely, exposure to hypoxia results in the increase of a number of factors, including heart rate, cardiac contractility, cardiac output, and both systemic and pulmonary artery resistance and pressures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-air-travel-and-heart-disease/abstract/10,49-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,49-51</a>].

One protocol used to gain significant insight into how a patient will respond to air travel is the hypoxia altitude simulation test. This procedure involves a patient breathing a gas mixture with an oxygen saturation of 15.1 percent, which simulates a cabin pressure of an airplane at 2440 meters (8000 feet) and allows the clinician to screen for hypoxia, significant symptoms, and arrhythmias.

For those with severe valvular heart disease or those with symptoms, altitude exposure should be proscribed and avoided. In those with mild to moderate valvular heart disease, echocardiography to document their current valvular and ventricular function and an exercise stress test to evaluate their hemodynamic changes and functional capacity at sea level is recommended. The patient should be warned to reduce their activity levels below their baseline activity level (particularly during the first five days at altitude), to be cautious when ingesting alcohol (or avoid), and to be aware of possible hemodynamic alterations such as hypertension, and should be given instructions on parameters and medication adjustments if necessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Arrhythmias</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of arrhythmias at altitude is variable and depends upon the patient group under study. Heightened sympathetic activity associated with high altitude may increase the frequency and duration of supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias in patients with underlying heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-air-travel-and-heart-disease/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>].</p><p>A study among young, healthy individuals without arrhythmias was conducted in a hypobaric chamber study of eight healthy men aged 21 to 31 years who were observed during exercise at simulated altitudes up to the equivalent of the summit of Mount Everest (8850 meters or 29,020 feet) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-air-travel-and-heart-disease/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].

At a still-higher altitude (2630 meters [8630 feet]), the frequency of ectopy was increased six- to sevenfold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-air-travel-and-heart-disease/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. It was hypothesized that the increase in premature beats was due to beta adrenergic stimulation at the higher altitude brought on by the early release of catecholamines.</p><p>Patients with stable CHD have also been evaluated. In a previously described study, 10 older adult patients with exercise-induced ischemic changes at sea level were studied at 2500 meters (8200 feet), both acutely and after five days of acclimatization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-air-travel-and-heart-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. VPBs were significantly increased with acute exposure but returned to sea level values after acclimatization. This suggests early sympathetic stimulation on acute exposure to altitude is driving these changes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Summary</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It appears that altitude can aggravate arrhythmias, particularly during acute exposure and with exercise, in patients with the appropriate underlying malady (especially older adults and those with known arrhythmias or CHD). Air travel alone is probably of low risk, except in those with baseline (resting) ventricular and supraventricular arrhythmias in whom the added stress of mild hypoxemia might lead to decompensation. Such patients should be cautioned about air travel <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> be considered for supplemental oxygen.</p><p>Similar recommendations apply to those contemplating vacationing at high altitude and patients should be warned to reduce their activity level to below their sea level baseline capacity, particularly during the first five days at altitude. Patients with arrhythmias should also be aware of and immediately treat both cardiac and non-cardiac manifestations of altitude exposure.</p><p>Caution is clearly needed in patients with poorly controlled rhythm disorders.

By contrast, there is a theoretical risk that handheld metal detectors may interfere with personal electronic devices and, hence, pacemakers and defibrillators. It is also noteworthy to recommend that patients who are exploring pacemaker implants choose a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-compatible device, ideally to 3 Tesla [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-air-travel-and-heart-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Congenital heart disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Congenital heart disease associated with intracardiac or extracardiac shunts may be associated with a net shunting of blood from the left, high-pressure side of the heart to the right, low-pressure side.

The extent to which arterial oxygen desaturation occurs will depend upon many factors, including the size of the communication, baseline right-sided pressures, and the extent of altitude-induced pulmonary hypertension.</p><p>It is important to appreciate that there may be an increased prevalence of congenital heart disease (ie, atrial septal <span class=\"nowrap\">defect/patent</span> foramen ovale, or patent ductus arteriosus [PDA]) at high altitudes. This is likely due to a persistence of the fetal pattern of the pulmonary vasculature (thick, smooth muscle cells, narrow lumens, small pulmonary vessels, increased pulmonary, and right ventricular pressures) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-air-travel-and-heart-disease/abstract/66-68\" class=\"abstract_t\">66-68</a>].

At that altitude, the barometric pressure is decreased to 564 mmHg, compared with 760 mmHg at sea level. The net effect is a partial pressure of oxygen in inspired air (PiO2) of 108 mmHg, with associated partial pressures of oxygen in the alveoli and arterial blood of normal individuals of 69 mmHg and 60 mmHg, respectively. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Barometric pressure and PiO2'</a> above.)</p><p>While an individual with a normal cardiopulmonary reserve can easily compensate for the reduced arterial PO2 at these altitudes and maintain adequate tissue oxygen delivery, those with little or no reserve are at risk for profound arterial desaturation and cardiopulmonary decompensation. Individuals with limited cardiopulmonary reserve exposed to high altitude may experience light headedness, chest pain, tingling in the extremities, palpitations, dyspnea, and hyperventilation. Further stress from air travel may result from associated immobility, jet lag, vibration, noise, and low humidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-air-travel-and-heart-disease/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Incidence of problems</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is a paucity of information regarding the incidence of serious health problems occurring during flight and, in the absence of any central registries or reporting requirements by airlines, it is likely that incidences are underestimated. In a United States study, the most common reasons for a flight to be diverted were cardiac incidents (28 percent), neurologic problems (20 percent), and food poisoning (20 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-air-travel-and-heart-disease/abstract/81-84\" class=\"abstract_t\">81-84</a>]. It is likely that the majority of cardiac incidents are vasovagal syncope related to dehydration, alcohol, recumbency, and emotional stress. With regards to in-flight deaths, a range of one death per 1.5 to 4.7 billion passenger miles flown has been reported.</p><p>The incidence of in-flight problems in patients with known coronary artery disease has not been well studied in patients receiving contemporary medical and revascularization therapies. One study investigated the transporting of patients with a recent myocardial infarction (MI) using a medical repatriation (returning a person back to one's place of origin or citizenship) company. During the period from April of 2004 through November of 2005, a total of 213 patients were transported 6 to 38 days (mean 12.9 days) following presentation with ST elevation MI (STEMI) or non-ST elevation MI (NSTEMI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-air-travel-and-heart-disease/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. No serious complications occurred in any of these patients. Despite relatively frequent asymptomatic hypoxemia (defined as pulse oximetry &lt;92 percent), none of the 56 patients with prior NSTEMI experienced in-flight angina, and only 3 of 157 patients with prior STEMI had angina.

A resting electrocardiogram (ECG) should be obtained and, if it is abnormal, a copy should be given to the patient to carry during all air travel.

The guidelines further suggest that early, low-level exercise testing after a STEMI may be reasonable to assess functional capacity and the ability to perform tasks at home and at work, evaluate the efficacy of medical therapy, and assess the risk of a subsequent cardiac event. Two low-level exercise testing protocols have been suggested if the following requirements are met: 1) Low-level exercise during in-hospital cardiac rehabilitation; 2) no symptoms of angina or HF; and 3) stable ECG 48 to 72 hours prior to testing. Submaximal stress testing (done at three to five days in patients without complications) or a symptom-limited exercise test (done at five days or later) is reasonable to &ldquo;permit detection of profound ischemia or other indicators of high risk that could be associated with post-discharge cardiac events.&rdquo; Taking all of this into account regarding flight preparations, the patient should have a companion, carry <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a>, and request airport transportation to avoid rushing. Patients with an MI complicated by severely depressed cardiac function or another significant complication (eg, HF, sudden cardiac arrest, or cardiogenic shock) should not fly until two weeks after they are deemed medically stable.</p><p>By contrast, the Aerospace Medical Association recommends that no air travel be undertaken within two to three weeks of an uncomplicated MI and within six weeks of a complicated MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-air-travel-and-heart-disease/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>].</p><p>The British Cardiovascular Society, in their &ldquo;Fitness to fly for passengers with cardiovascular disease&rdquo; report, also performed a comprehensive review of the evidence (mostly observational) upon which recommendations for air flight after an acute coronary syndrome can be made [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-air-travel-and-heart-disease/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].

In one report of tourists seeking visas in Nepal (where about one-third come for trekking), 20 percent were 50 years or older [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-air-travel-and-heart-disease/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2692101844\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute mountain sickness and high altitude illness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High altitude illness prevention and acute mountain sickness (AMS) prevention and treatment are described in detail elsewhere.

Another review examined sudden deaths among participants engaging in high mountain hiking, skiing, or both in Austria between 1985 and 1991 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-air-travel-and-heart-disease/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. A total of 416 deaths were deemed sudden, representing about 30 percent of all mountain sport-related deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-air-travel-and-heart-disease/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. Most of the deaths occurred at altitudes between 1100 to 2100 meters (3600 to 6900 feet). Hikers were more than two times as likely as skiers to die. Among the hikers, the risk of death was highly influenced by age and lack of prior physical activity. The relatively low incidence of cardiac complications among trekkers and mountaineers most likely results from the low incidence of cardiovascular disease in this population. For instance, in a survey of ski mountaineers in the Austrian Alps, only 5.7 percent of women and 12.0 percent of men over the age of 40 reported any type of cardiovascular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-air-travel-and-heart-disease/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p>Prior myocardial infarction (MI) appears to be the greatest predictor of risk regarding sudden cardiac death (SCD) among those who snow ski.

Other individuals should avoid extreme aerobic exercise at altitude because previously asymptomatic heart conditions are likely to be more severe at initial diagnosis in such conditions.</p><p>Available automated external defibrillators (AED) can be life-saving.

Nevertheless, reasonable recommendations can be made when accounting for the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Baseline functional capacity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Expected altitude that will be encountered</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anticipated activity level and expected duration of time to be spent at high altitude</p><p/><p>Patients with recent, unstable cardiovascular conditions should be directed to refrain from any altitude exposure. By contrast, stable patients who exercise at sea level without symptoms can generally exercise at altitude as long as they are vigilant in monitoring their heart rate and blood pressure and plan to decrease the total intensity and duration of their exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-air-travel-and-heart-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

This is especially true during the first few days.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As an individual treks higher, ascend gradually and purposefully each day (&lt;305 meters [1000 feet]), and include a &ldquo;no ascent day&rdquo; every third day.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Achieve a moderate degree of physical conditioning at sea level before exercising at high altitude [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-air-travel-and-heart-disease/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Consider performing an exercise stress test to evaluate heart disease before planning any activity at altitude if there are any concerns about cardiovascular status or any changes in status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-air-travel-and-heart-disease/abstract/110\" class=\"abstract_t\">110</a>]. However, exercise stress testing is not routinely recommended without cause.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients within two weeks of an acute myocardial infarction (MI) should consider air travel only if there is no angina, dyspnea, or hypoxemia at rest. Moreover, patients should have no fear of flying; if the patient flies with a companion, make sure <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a> is available and every effort should be made to avoid both the emotional and physical demands of travel. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Coronary heart disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with unstable angina, uncontrolled ventricular or supraventricular arrhythmias, symptomatic valvular heart disease, or decompensated heart failure should travel only in an emergency.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Advise patients with coronary artery disease, arrhythmia, or congestive heart failure that they may become symptomatic at lower exercise workloads at high altitudes (&gt;2500 meters [8200 feet]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/high-altitude-air-travel-and-heart-disease/abstract/30,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,33</a>].
