People can have AVMs in different places in their body. This article discusses AVMs in the brain.</p><p>AVMs in the brain are rare and usually form before a person is born. Many times they do not cause any symptoms, but in some people, they do cause serious symptoms or problems. These can happen if an AVM pushes on the brain or keeps part of the brain from getting enough oxygen. An AVM can also sometimes tear open and bleed into the brain. This happens because the blood vessels in an AVM are not as strong as normal blood vessels. A severe bleed in the brain can cause brain injury and death.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20174252\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of an AVM?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many AVMs do not cause any symptoms. People find out they have an AVM when their doctor does a test for another reason.</p><p>When AVMs do cause symptoms, they can cause:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headaches</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seizures &ndash; Seizures are waves of abnormal electrical activity in the brain. They can make you pass out, or move or behave strangely.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms of a stroke &ndash; A stroke is when a part of the brain is damaged because of a problem with blood flow. A stroke can cause:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A person's face to look uneven or droop to 1 side</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Weakness or numbness in 1 or both arms &ndash; For example, 1 arm might drift down if a person tries to hold both arms out.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Trouble speaking, or speech that sounds strange</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20174267\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I call the doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you have a seizure or severe headache, call your doctor or nurse right away.</p><p>If you have symptoms of a stroke, <strong>call for an ambulance (in the US and Canada, dial 9-1-1)</strong>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20174282\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for an AVM?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. The doctor or nurse can do different tests to check for an AVM. Tests can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A CT or MRI scan of the brain &ndash; These are imaging tests that create pictures of the inside of the brain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cerebral angiography &ndash; This test shows how blood flows through the blood vessels in the brain. For this test, the doctor will put a thin tube into a large blood vessel in your body, usually one in your leg. Then the doctor will move the tube up into your neck. When the tube is in place, he or she will inject a dye into the tube and take X-rays. The dye will show up on the X-rays.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20174297\"><span class=\"h1\">How is an AVM treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends on different factors, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether your AVM is bleeding or not</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How big your AVM is and where it is in your brain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your symptoms</p><p/><p>AVMs that are bleeding or causing symptoms usually need treatment. The different treatments for an AVM include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery to remove the AVM</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiosurgery &ndash; This is not surgery. It involves getting radiation (high doses of X-rays) in the area of the AVM. Over time, the radiation makes the AVM less likely to bleed. This treatment usually takes a few years to work.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Embolization &ndash; This is a procedure done during cerebral angiography. The doctor puts a material into the blood vessel that brings blood to the AVM. The material blocks off the blood vessel. Sometimes this procedure works on its own. Other times, doctors do surgery or radiosurgery after it.</p><p/><p>If your AVM is causing seizures, your doctor will treat your seizures with anti-seizure medicines. These medicines can help prevent you from having more seizures.</p><p>If your AVM is not bleeding or causing symptoms, your doctor will talk with you about whether it needs to be treated. Not all AVMs need to be treated, especially if they are not bleeding or causing symptoms.</p><p>There are benefits and downsides to treating AVMs that are not bleeding or causing symptoms. The main benefit is that treatment can prevent a future bleed in the brain. The main downside is that the treatments can cause problems of their own. For example, surgery can cause a seizure, stroke, or brain swelling or bleeding.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20174312\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have an AVM and want to get pregnant, talk with your doctor. He or she might recommend treating your AVM before you try to get pregnant.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20174327\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemorrhagic-stroke-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hemorrhagic stroke (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=stroke-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Stroke (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=seizures-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Seizures (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=headaches-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Headaches in adults (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemorrhagic-stroke-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Hemorrhagic stroke treatment (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=stroke-symptoms-and-diagnosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Stroke symptoms and diagnosis (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=seizures-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Seizures in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=seizures-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Seizures in children (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=headache-causes-and-diagnosis-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Headache causes and diagnosis in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
