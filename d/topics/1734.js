Advances in infant intensive care have helped to reduce mortality, but survivors remain at high risk for neurologic sequelae and lifelong impairments. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neonates with bacterial meningitis should receive initial care in an intensive care unit (ICU). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Supportive care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antimicrobial therapy for neonatal meningitis is indicated if the results of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) evaluation are suggestive of bacterial meningitis. Appropriate broad spectrum antimicrobial therapy with agents that have adequate CSF penetration should be initiated as soon as possible. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bacterial-meningitis-in-the-neonate-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bacterial meningitis in the neonate: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Laboratory features'</a> and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Antimicrobial therapy'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend suspected neonatal meningitis be treated initially with empiric antibiotic therapy that provides broad coverage for the most likely pathogens (group B <em>Streptococcus</em> [GBS] and gram-negative enteric organisms, including <em>Escherichia coli</em>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). The choice of the initial empiric regimen is based on the infant's age, likely pathogens, and the susceptibility patterns of gram-negative organisms in a particular nursery or neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Empiric therapy'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For early-onset meningitis (ie, within the first three to six days of age), an appropriate empiric regimen includes <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ampicillin</a> plus an aminoglycoside (usually <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">gentamicin</a>). When the CSF Gram stain reveals gram-negative bacilli, the empiric regimen should be expanded to include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefotaxime-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cefotaxime</a> (if available). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Early-onset'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For late-onset meningitis (ie, after the first week of life), appropriate empiric antibiotic regimens are as follows (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Late-onset'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>For neonates admitted from the community, the regimen includes <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ampicillin</a> plus an aminoglycoside (usually <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">gentamicin</a>) plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefotaxime-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cefotaxime</a> (if available).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>For infants who continue to be hospitalized from birth, the regimen includes <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">vancomycin</a> plus an aminoglycoside (usually <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">gentamicin</a>) plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefotaxime-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cefotaxime</a>. If GBS or <em>L. monocytogenes </em>is suspected (eg, on the basis of the Gram stain), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ampicillin</a> should be added to the regimen.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefotaxime-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cefotaxime</a> is unavailable, alternative agents include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftazidime-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ceftazidime</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ceftriaxone</a>. Ceftriaxone should not be used in neonates with clinically significant hyperbilirubinemia or those receiving concurrent IV calcium (including parenteral nutrition). (See <a href=\"#H1262800385\" class=\"local\">'If cefotaxime is unavailable'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If multidrug-resistant (MDR) gram-negative rods are a concern (based on the susceptibility patterns in the particular NICU), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meropenem-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">meropenem</a> should be substituted for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefotaxime-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cefotaxime</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Once the causative agent and its in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility pattern are known, empiric antimicrobial therapy should be altered accordingly. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Specific therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The duration of antimicrobial therapy depends upon the causative organism and the clinical course. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Duration'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bacterial-meningitis-in-the-neonate-neurologic-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bacterial meningitis in the neonate: Neurologic complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The response to antimicrobial and supportive therapy and the potential development of complications are monitored clinically, through repeat neurologic examinations, evaluation of the CSF, and by neuroimaging. Neurologic complications must be considered in the neonate with neonatal meningitis who fails to improve clinically after 24 to 48 hours of appropriate antibiotic therapy. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring response to therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bacterial-meningitis-in-the-neonate-neurologic-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bacterial meningitis in the neonate: Neurologic complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lumbar puncture (LP) should be repeated 24 to 48 hours after initiation of antimicrobial therapy to document sterilization of the CSF. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Repeat lumbar puncture'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neuroimaging is indicated in neonates with signs suggesting neurologic complications. In addition, we perform magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) 48 to 72 hours before the anticipated discontinuation of antimicrobial therapy in all neonates with bacterial meningitis, even in those with an apparently uncomplicated course. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Neuroimaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mortality of neonatal bacterial meningitis is approximately 10 percent. Approximately 20 percent of survivors have severe disability and another 35 percent have mild to moderate disability. Long-term neurologic sequelae are somewhat more frequent after gram-negative neonatal meningitis than after group B streptococcal neonatal meningitis. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Outcome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long-term follow-up for survivors of neonatal meningitis includes monitoring of hearing, visual acuity, and developmental status. (See <a href=\"#H2125105630\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bacterial-meningitis-in-the-neonate-treatment-and-outcome/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Wenger JD, Hightower AW, Facklam RR, et al.
