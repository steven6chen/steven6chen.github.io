The average daily magnesium intake is 360 mg (15 mmol). Approximately one-third of this magnesium is absorbed, principally in the small bowel through both a saturable transport system (presumably mediated by a channel encoded by the TRPM6 gene) and passive diffusion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hypomagnesemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hypomagnesemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Two other processes occur in the gut: the secretion of approximately 40 mg (1.7 mmol) in intestinal secretions, and the absorption of another 20 mg (0.8 mmol) in the large bowel. In the healthy adult, there is no net gain or loss of magnesium from bone so that balance is achieved by the urinary excretion of the approximately 100 mg (4.1 mmol) that is absorbed. Changes in intake are balanced by changes in urinary magnesium reabsorption, principally in the loop of Henle and the distal tubule.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">UNITS OF MEASUREMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Before discussing the factors responsible for the regulation of magnesium balance, it is useful to review the different units that may be used to measure the plasma (or serum) magnesium concentration. Laboratories in the United States usually report the results in units of <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> while other countries primarily use <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span>. The relationship among these units can be expressed by the following equations:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160;<span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> &#160;= &#160;<span class=\"nowrap\">[mg/dL</span> &#160;x &#160;10] &#160;&divide; &#160;mol wt</p></div></div><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160;<span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> &#160;= &#160;<span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> &#160;x &#160;valence</p></div></div><p>Since the molecular weight of magnesium is 24.3 and the valence is +2, 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> is equivalent to 0.50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> and to 1.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>. Thus, a normal range of the plasma magnesium concentration of 1.4 to 1.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> is equivalent to 0.70 to 0.85 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> and 1.7 to 2.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">RENAL HANDLING OF MAGNESIUM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Magnesium transport differs from that of most other ions in that the proximal tubule is not the major site of reabsorption. Approximately 80 percent of the total plasma magnesium is filtered at the glomerulus. Only 15 to 25 percent of the ultrafiltrable magnesium is reabsorbed passively in the proximal tubule (down concentration gradients generated by the reabsorption of sodium and water) and 5 to 10 percent in the distal tubule. Micropuncture studies (in which small pipettes are inserted into different nephron segments) indicate that the major site of magnesium transport is the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle, where 60 to 70 percent of the ultrafiltrable magnesium is reabsorbed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-magnesium-balance/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Loop of Henle</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The bulk of magnesium transport in the thick ascending limb, like that of calcium, is passive, occurring by paracellular diffusion between the cells and driven by the favorable electrical (lumen-positive) gradient resulting from the reabsorption of sodium chloride (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F75301\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75301 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-magnesium-balance/abstract/1,3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3-5</a>]. This lumen-positive voltage is generated by two distinct processes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reabsorption of sodium, potassium, and chloride via the Na-K-2Cl cotransporter, with apical recycling of potassium via ROMK channels back into the lumen, is thought to be the major contributor to the electrical gradient (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F94326\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef94326 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Net reabsorption of sodium chloride dilutes the tubular fluid and generates a transepithelial concentration gradient toward the end of the thick ascending limb that favors backflux of sodium chloride from the peritubular to the tubular space. It has been hypothesized that the presence of a paracellular pathway in the cortical thick ascending limb that is selective for sodium over chloride ions generates an electrical diffusion potential that augments the lumen-positive voltage, favoring additional reabsorption of magnesium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-magnesium-balance/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p>Paracellular magnesium reabsorption appears to be facilitated by a complex of two tight junction proteins, specifically, claudin-16 (also known as paracellin-1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-magnesium-balance/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] and claudin-19 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-magnesium-balance/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], that interact to form paracellular divalent cation pores and directly mediate magnesium reabsorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-magnesium-balance/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p>It has been suggested that they may also act as a paracellular pore for Na in the cortical thick ascending limb, thereby facilitating the generation of the NaCl diffusion potential that is hypothesized to drive additional Mg reabsorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-magnesium-balance/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p>Conversely, claudin-10b is a claudin that mediates paracellular Na reabsorption in the thick ascending limb but seems to inhibit magnesium reabsorption. Claudin-10b is predominantly expressed in the medullary thick ascending limb in a population of cells that is distinct from those expressing claudin-16 and -19 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-magnesium-balance/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Passive reabsorption of Na would be expected to dissipate the transepithelial voltage generated by transcellular Na, K, and Cl transport with apical K recycling and thereby reduce paracellular magnesium reabsorption.</p><p>Factors controlling magnesium transport act through changes in the voltage <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> permeability of the paracellular pathway. Thus, decreased reabsorption and magnesium wasting can be induced by the administration of a loop diuretic, which inhibits sodium and chloride reabsorption, or by mutations in claudin-16 or -19, which cause familial hypomagnesemia with hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-magnesium-balance/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Conversely, inactivating mutations in claudin-10b cause a syndrome of renal sodium wasting that is associated with hypermagnesemia and urinary magnesium retention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-magnesium-balance/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=effect-of-diuretics-on-magnesium-handling-by-the-kidney\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Effect of diuretics on magnesium handling by the kidney&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hypomagnesemia#H8658123\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hypomagnesemia&quot;, section on 'Familial hypomagnesemia with hypercalciuria and nephrocalcinosis (FHHNC)'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hypomagnesemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hypomagnesemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Several other factors alter magnesium transport in the loop of Henle:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plasma magnesium concentration &ndash; Loop magnesium reabsorption (particularly in the cortical aspect of the thick ascending limb) varies with changes in the plasma magnesium concentration, which is the main physiologic regulator of urinary magnesium excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-magnesium-balance/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Hypermagnesemia inhibits loop magnesium (and calcium) transport, while hypomagnesemia stimulates magnesium transport in both normal and magnesium-depleted animals, thereby decreasing further magnesium losses.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Plasma calcium concentration &ndash; Hypercalcemia also inhibits magnesium (and calcium) reabsorption, leading to hypermagnesuria and hypercalciuria. This seems to occur by activation of the calcium-sensing receptor on the basolateral membrane of the thick ascending limb. Downstream of the calcium-sensing receptor is a complex signaling sequence whereby calcineurin and NFATc1 stimulate the transcription of two micro-RNAs, miR-9-1 and miR-374, that normally inhibit the expression of the tight junction protein, claudin-14 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-magnesium-balance/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Claudin-14, once expressed, physically binds to and inhibits the claudin-16 and -19 complex, thereby inhibiting Mg reabsorption. Further discussion of the role of this receptor in the modulation of calcium and sodium transport is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disorders-of-the-calcium-sensing-receptor-familial-hypocalciuric-hypercalcemia-and-autosomal-dominant-hypocalcemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disorders of the calcium-sensing receptor: Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia and autosomal dominant hypocalcemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hormones &ndash; A number of hormones have been shown to alter magnesium transport in the thick ascending limb in experimental studies. These include parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcitonin, glucagon, arginine vasopressin (AVP), and the beta-adrenergic agonists, all of which are coupled to adenylate cyclase in the thick ascending limb. Postulated mechanisms include an increase in luminal-positive voltage (via activation of basolateral membrane chloride conductance and apical Na-K-2Cl cotransport) and an increase in paracellular permeability (possibly by phosphorylation of paracellular pathway proteins) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-magnesium-balance/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. It is not known if these effects have any important role in normal magnesium homeostasis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other factors &ndash; Metabolic alkalosis stimulates and metabolic acidosis, hypokalemia, and phosphate depletion inhibit magnesium reabsorption in the loop of Henle, contributing to changes in urinary magnesium excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-magnesium-balance/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The mechanisms for these changes are unknown.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Distal reabsorption</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Distal reabsorption of magnesium occurs in the distal convoluted tubule (DCT) via transcellular transport (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F94327\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef94327 \">figure 3</a>). It is important for the fine tuning of renal magnesium excretion and hence is potentially a key step for physiological regulation.</p><p>Genetic diseases that produce hypomagnesemia have helped elucidate important components of distal magnesium transport (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hypomagnesemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hypomagnesemia&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Magnesium enters the DCT cells from the tubular lumen via a magnesium channel complex composed of TRPM6 and TRPM7; this occurs passively, driven by a favorable electrical gradient produced by potassium flux from the cell into the tubular lumen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-magnesium-balance/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Passive influx of magnesium is believed to be the rate-limiting step in distal magnesium reabsorption.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mutations in TRPM6 cause autosomal recessive hypomagnesemia with secondary hypocalcemia, which is due both to impaired intestinal absorption of magnesium and a renal magnesium leak [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-magnesium-balance/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Several factors regulate TRPM6, including dietary magnesium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-magnesium-balance/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], estrogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-magnesium-balance/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], and acid-base balance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-magnesium-balance/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In addition, epidermal growth factor (EGF) regulates TRPM6 by stimulating protein trafficking to the plasma membrane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-magnesium-balance/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. This is why mutations in pro-EGF cause isolated renal hypomagnesemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-magnesium-balance/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], as does treatment with EGF inhibitors such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cetuximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cetuximab</a>. As magnesium entry is driven by the electrical gradient across the apical membrane, it is also regulated by the setpoint of the membrane potential. Mutations in the apical voltage-gated potassium channel, Kv1.1, cause autosomal dominant hypomagnesemia, presumably by altering the apical membrane potential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-magnesium-balance/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The mechanism for basolateral exit of magnesium in the DCT is incompletely understood. CNNM2 encodes a transmembrane protein that is localized to the basolateral membrane of the thick ascending limb and DCT and has been proposed to function either as a magnesium channel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-magnesium-balance/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>] or magnesium-sensitive sodium channel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-magnesium-balance/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. CNNM2 is also upregulated under conditions of magnesium deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-magnesium-balance/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>] and is mutated in dominant isolated renal magnesium wasting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-magnesium-balance/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Thus, CNNM2 could be a candidate for the basolateral exit pathway, although the driving force for magnesium exit is unclear.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition, distal magnesium reabsorption is known to be dependent upon the gamma subunit of the Na-K-ATPase (encoded by the FXYD2 gene) since mutations in FXYD2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-magnesium-balance/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], or in hepatocyte nuclear factor 1B (that regulates transcription of FXYD2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-magnesium-balance/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>], cause dominant isolated renal hypomagnesemia and hypomagnesemia with renal malformations. Exactly how the gamma subunit of the Na-K-ATPase regulates magnesium transport is unclear; it may determine the basolateral membrane sodium gradient or ensure hyperpolarization of the membrane potential and hence drive apical magnesium entry.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mutations in the basolateral potassium channel, Kir4.1, cause a syndrome called SeSAME or EAST, which consists of seizures, sensorineural deafness, ataxia, mental retardation, and various electrolyte abnormalities that include renal magnesium wasting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-magnesium-balance/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. Kir4.1 is proposed to act by recycling potassium across the basolateral membrane, thus facilitating Na-K-ATPase activity.</p><p/><p>Distally acting diuretics can also affect magnesium handling. Chronic use of thiazide diuretics is associated with hypomagnesemia and renal magnesium wasting; in addition, Gitelman syndrome, which is due to an abnormality in the gene coding for the thiazide-sensitive cotransporter (NCC), is characterized by hypomagnesemia due to urinary magnesium wasting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-magnesium-balance/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bartter-and-gitelman-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bartter and Gitelman syndromes&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hypomagnesemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hypomagnesemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Both thiazide diuretics and murine knockout of NCC downregulate TRPM6 expression; this likely explains the mechanism of the magnesuria caused by thiazides and Gitelman syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-magnesium-balance/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In addition, the potassium depletion associated with these conditions may contribute to the hypomagnesemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-magnesium-balance/abstract/1,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,36</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=effect-of-diuretics-on-magnesium-handling-by-the-kidney\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Effect of diuretics on magnesium handling by the kidney&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In contrast to thiazides, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiloride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiloride</a> is a magnesium-sparing diuretic, possibly acting by hyperpolarizing of the membrane potential, thereby increasing the driving force for magnesium entry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-magnesium-balance/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">REGULATION OF PLASMA MAGNESIUM CONCENTRATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In contrast to other ions, magnesium is treated by the body as an orphan: there are no hormones that have a substantial role in regulating urinary magnesium excretion, and bone, the principal reservoir of magnesium, does not readily exchange with circulating magnesium. This is in marked contrast to the roles of aldosterone and atrial natriuretic peptide in sodium excretion; antidiuretic hormone in water excretion; aldosterone and cell potassium stores in the regulation of potassium balance; and parathyroid hormone (PTH), vitamin D, calcitonin, and bone stores in the maintenance of calcium balance.</p><p>The inability to readily mobilize magnesium stores means that, with negative magnesium balance, the initial losses come primarily from the extracellular fluid; equilibration with bone stores does not begin for several weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-magnesium-balance/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Thus, the plasma magnesium concentration falls rapidly with negative magnesium balance, leading to a marked reduction in magnesium excretion, unless urinary magnesium wasting is present (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hypomagnesemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hypomagnesemia&quot;</a>). It is the enhanced reabsorption in the loop of Henle and distal tubule and fall in urinary magnesium excretion that protects the plasma magnesium concentration against further losses. The fractional excretion of magnesium, which is between 3 and 5 percent in subjects with normal renal function ingesting a typical diet, can fall to below 0.5 percent with magnesium depletion due to extrarenal losses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-magnesium-balance/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-treatment-of-hypomagnesemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and treatment of hypomagnesemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Conversely, there is no protection against hypermagnesemia with loss of renal function. In this setting, continued intake leads to magnesium retention that is predominantly in the extracellular fluid. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-treatment-of-hypermagnesemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and treatment of hypermagnesemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CELLULAR MAGNESIUM STORES AND CYTOSOLIC MAGNESIUM ACTIVITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The total intracellular magnesium content approximates 8 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> (10 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span>. However, most of the cell magnesium is bound to ATP and other intracellular nucleotides and enzyme complexes. Some studies, using magnesium-sensitive dyes based upon the FURA compound, indicate that the free cytosolic concentration is in the range of 0.6 to 0.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L</span> (1.2 to 1.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-magnesium-balance/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Changes in the plasma magnesium levels alter cellular magnesium content slowly. It is not yet known how magnesium enters cells, but energy is not required because of the favorable electrochemical gradient. As the intracellular free magnesium is significantly below electrochemical equilibrium, however, there must be some type of energy-dependent extrusion mechanism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/regulation-of-magnesium-balance/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. An ATP-dependent sodium-magnesium exchanger has been described in several tissues, but its physiologic importance is not known.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Magnesium balance is a function of intake and excretion.
