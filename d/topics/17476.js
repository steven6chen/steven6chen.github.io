The MitraClip, as well as the CARILLON mitral annuloplasty device, has CE Mark approval. (See <a href=\"#H14268856\" class=\"local\">'Investigational technologies'</a> below.)</p><p>The MitraClip is a transcatheter technology based on the surgical Alfieri edge-to-edge repair, which involves suturing together the middle segments of the anterior and posterior mitral valve leaflets, thereby creating a &quot;double orifice&quot; mitral regurgitant area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transcatheter-mitral-valve-repair/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The MitraClip system utilizes a cobalt chromium clip covered with a polypropylene fabric that grasps both the anterior and posterior mitral valve leaflets, thereby reducing mitral regurgitation (MR) by increasing the coaptation between the regurgitant valve leaflets. In some cases, a second clip may be required to adequately reduce the MR severity toward a goal of final regurgitant severity &le;2+ [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transcatheter-mitral-valve-repair/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Transesophageal echocardiography demonstrates the location of the major leaflet pathology, the size and extent of a flail segment, and the demonstration that there is adequate leaflet support for clip implantation. Three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography enhances the visualization of the valve with improved localization of the leaflet pathology and demonstration of anatomic features unsuitable for treatment with the clip such as a cleft leaflet, vegetations, and perforations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transcatheter-mitral-valve-repair/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>].

Prohibitive surgical risk is based on a 30-day Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS)-predicted operative mortality of &ge;6 percent. However, STS estimated risk does not capture all relevant risk factors, so the STS risk estimate should be combined with other risk assessment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F95631\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95631 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transcatheter-mitral-valve-repair/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=estimating-the-mortality-risk-of-valvular-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Estimating the mortality risk of valvular surgery&quot;</a>).

Because of the need for TEE guidance and careful device manipulation, the procedure is usually performed under general anesthesia. During the procedure, heparin is administered to an activated clotting time &gt;250 seconds; a therapeutic level is especially important after transseptal puncture. In investigational studies of the device, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> 325 mg was administered for 6 to 12 months, along with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a> 75 mg daily for one month [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transcatheter-mitral-valve-repair/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. These recommendations are based on extrapolation from prior studies of device endothelialization.</p><p>Access is obtained via the femoral vein, and a transseptal puncture is performed to cross the interatrial septum into the left atrium. The MitraClip steerable catheter is then advanced into the left atrium, and echocardiographic guidance is utilized to align the MitraClip device with the regurgitant valve leaflets and into the left ventricle. The MitraClip is then drawn back with the clip arms open in order to grasp the leaflets at the site of regurgitation. The arms are then closed, and Doppler echocardiography is used to determine the consequent reduction in MR. If the reduction in MR is not adequate, the clip arms can be reopened and the placement adjusted prior to final device deployment. In approximately 40 percent of cases, an additional MitraClip may be implanted in order to adequately reduce MR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transcatheter-mitral-valve-repair/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>During the procedure, real-time two- and three-dimensional transesophageal echocardiography guides the positioning of the trans-septal puncture, placement of the mitral clip, and assessment of the mitral valve morphology and regurgitation severity following the clip placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transcatheter-mitral-valve-repair/abstract/7,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,12</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14268796\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOMES OF TRANSCATHETER MITRAL VALVE REPAIR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The outcomes of transcatheter mitral valve repair (TMVR) have been investigated in a number of cohort studies as well as one large randomized trial comparing transcatheter repair with surgical repair (the EVEREST II trial). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H90524716\"><span class=\"h2\">Early results</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies of commercial use of TMVR in Europe and the United States (US)<strong> </strong>have shown rates of procedural success (including postimplantation mitral regurgitation [MR] grade &le;2) generally over 90 percent and in-hospital mortality rates of 0 to 4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transcatheter-mitral-valve-repair/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. As an example, a study of the initial commercial experience with TMVR in the US included data on 564 high surgical-risk patients (median Society of Thoracic Surgeons Predicted Risk of Mortality score 7.9 percent for surgical repair and 10 percent for MV replacement) with symptomatic, predominantly degenerative MR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transcatheter-mitral-valve-repair/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Procedural success (defined as MR &le;2 without conversion to open surgery or in-hospital death) was achieved in 90.6 percent with an in-hospital mortality rate of 2.3 percent. Thirty-day complication rates included death in 5.8 percent, stroke in 1.8 percent, bleeding in 2.6 percent, and device-related complications in 1.4 percent. Further study is required to determine the long-term efficacy of TMVR in various patient populations.

The EVEREST II randomized trial compared the outcomes of TMVR with surgical mitral repair or replacement among 279 patients with moderate-to-severe or severe (grade 3+ or 4+) MR who were candidates for either procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transcatheter-mitral-valve-repair/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Most of the patients had heart failure at baseline (91 percent in the TMVR group and 78 percent in the surgical group). A primary regurgitant jet originating from malcoaptation of the middle scallops of the anterior and posterior leaflets was required. Most of the patients (73 percent) had primary (degenerative) MR. Among the patients undergoing mitral valve surgery, 14 percent underwent mitral valve replacement and 86 percent underwent repair. The following results were obtained:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The primary composite end point for efficacy was freedom from death, from surgery for mitral valve dysfunction, and from grade 3+ or 4+ mitral regurgitation at 12 months. This end point was more frequent in the surgery group (73 versus 55 percent) due to the higher rate of subsequent surgery for mitral valve dysfunction in the TMVR group (20 versus 2 percent). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TMVR and mitral valve surgery were associated with similar rates of overall mortality at one year (6 percent for both).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade 3+ or 4+ MR was similar in the two groups (21 versus 20 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Major adverse event rates at 30 days were significantly lower in the TMVR group compared with the surgical group (15 versus 48 percent).

More commonly, the clip may partially detach; this complication can usually be treated with surgery. Low rates of clip detachment have been reported in studies. As an example, in the EVEREST II study, nine patients were noted in the first 12 months to have partial clip detachment; one additional patient developed partial clip detachment from years one to four. All of these patients were treated with subsequent mitral valve surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transcatheter-mitral-valve-repair/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>An ongoing post-approval study will include device embolization as an end point in order to identify any signal of device complication during clinical use. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14268850\"><span class=\"h2\">Mitral stenosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TMVR creates an increase in diastolic pressure gradient across the mitral valve, and the development of clinically significant mitral stenosis is a potential but rare complication of MitraClip implantation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemodynamic studies of mitral valve area before and after MitraClip implantation have not shown clinically significant increases in mean diastolic mitral valve gradients or reduction in mitral valve area acutely or at 12-month follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transcatheter-mitral-valve-repair/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

Patients who have undergone TMVR should be instructed regarding the importance of careful dental hygiene and prompt medical care for fever or other signs of infection. </p><p>The role of antibiotic prophylaxis for infective endocarditis for patients with prosthetic material used for valve repair is controversial. For patients with prosthetic material used for valve repair, we suggest antibiotic prophylaxis when undergoing a relevant procedure, particularly dental procedures that involve manipulation of gingival tissue or the periapical region of the teeth or perforation of the oral mucosa. However, there is lack of consensus among experts on the role of antibiotic prophylaxis for infective endocarditis for patients with prosthetic material used for valve repair. The 2015 European Society of Cardiology infective endocarditis guidelines included prosthetic material used for valve repair as an indication for antibiotic prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transcatheter-mitral-valve-repair/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In contrast, the 2014 American Heart <span class=\"nowrap\">Association/American</span> College of Cardiology valve guidelines did not include presence of prosthetic material used for valve repair, such as a MitraClip, as an indication for infective endocarditis prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transcatheter-mitral-valve-repair/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

The feasibility of PASCAL mitral valve repair was evaluated in 23 patients with symptomatic severe mitral regurgitation (22 with New York Heart Association [NYHA] functional class III or IV), most of whom were not considered candidates for MitraClip repair due to anatomical complexity or lack of an approved indication for use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transcatheter-mitral-valve-repair/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. During 30-day follow-up, three patients (13 percent) died. Among the 20 patients alive at 30-day follow-up, 19 were NYHA functional class I or II.
