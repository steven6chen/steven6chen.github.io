They account for approximately 4 percent of all spinal cord tumors, and 7 to 10 percent of tumors arising in the posterior fossa in adults.</p><p>Hemangioblastomas occur both sporadically and as an important component of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, along with retinal angiomas, endolymphatic sac tumors, renal cell carcinoma, pheochromocytomas, pancreatic cysts, and neuroendocrine tumors.</p><p>The clinical manifestations and management of patients with hemangioblastomas are reviewed here. The clinical manifestations and overall management of patients with VHL disease are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and management of von Hippel-Lindau disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Sporadic versus VHL-associated tumors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hemangioblastomas may occur either sporadically or as a manifestation of von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease. Although approximately 75 percent of all hemangioblastomas appear to be sporadic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemangioblastoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], some of these may represent occult cases of VHL that can be detected if patients are appropriately screened for germline VHL mutations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and management of von Hippel-Lindau disease&quot;, section on 'Hemangioblastomas'</a>.)</p><p>Sporadic and VHL-related hemangioblastomas differ significantly in their presentation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sporadic hemangioblastomas are usually solitary. Thus, the presence of multiple tumors within the neuraxis should raise suspicion for VHL disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemangioblastomas associated with VHL are generally diagnosed at a younger age than sporadic tumors. In one series, the mean age at initial diagnosis was 29 years in patients with VHL, while the average age at presentation in those without VHL is one to two decades older [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemangioblastoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with VHL disease, approximately one-half of tumors are in the spinal cord, 40 percent are in the cerebellum, and 10 percent are in the brainstem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemangioblastoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Supratentorial lesions are rare. For those with sporadic tumors, isolated cerebellar lesions are substantially more common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemangioblastoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p>The presence of more than one hemangioblastoma, an early age at diagnosis, or the presence of other manifestations of VHL disease should all serve as an indication for genetic screening for germline VHL mutations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F66320\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66320 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and management of von Hippel-Lindau disease&quot;, section on 'Genetic testing'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hemangioblastomas can cause local symptoms by compression of neural structures, bleeding, or paraneoplastic complications. In patients with VHL disease, asymptomatic hemangioblastomas are diagnosed based upon imaging surveillance. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease#H3121858651\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and management of von Hippel-Lindau disease&quot;, section on 'Surveillance protocols'</a>.)</p><p>Hemangioblastomas can cause neurologic deficits by direct compression or tumor-associated hemorrhage.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The specific deficit from direct compression depends upon tumor location, and may include cerebellar ataxia, oculomotor nerve dysfunction, motor weakness, or sensory deficits. Patients with spinal hemangioblastomas frequently present with pain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F79982\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef79982 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemangioblastoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute hemorrhage can be catastrophic. Intracerebral bleeding from a cerebellar hemangioblastoma may cause rapid obstructive hydrocephalus, cerebellar tonsillar herniation, or brainstem compression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemangioblastoma/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Bleeding from a spinal hemangioblastoma may result in acute quadriplegia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemangioblastoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], while headache, back pain, or radiculopathy may be caused by subarachnoid hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemangioblastoma/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. In these situations, emergency neurosurgical intervention is indicated. The risk of bleeding in treated or untreated hemangioblastomas is unknown. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Paraneoplastic erythrocytosis has also been reported in patients with hemangioblastoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemangioblastoma/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. The elevated hematocrit and red cell mass are a result of excessive erythropoietin production by the hemangioblastoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemangioblastoma/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-the-patient-with-polycythemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to the patient with polycythemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The preferred diagnostic procedure is gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). A computed tomography (CT) scan of the neuraxis is not an adequate diagnostic procedure because bone artifacts may obscure small tumors in the posterior fossa or spinal canal. For patients who cannot undergo an MRI, conventional angiography together with CT scanning are alternative diagnostic tests to define the location and vasculature feeding the hemangioblastoma.</p><p>The characteristic MRI feature of hemangioblastomas is an enhancing nodule associated with a cyst located in the cerebellum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F63358\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef63358 \">image 2</a>) or a homogeneously enhancing lesion on the surface of or within the spinal cord (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F79982\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef79982 \">image 1</a>). These features are not pathognomonic, and the differential diagnosis includes astrocytoma, ganglioglioma, or metastatic tumors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-pathologic-diagnosis-of-gliomas\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and pathologic diagnosis of gliomas&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spinal-cord-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spinal cord tumors&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Smaller hemangioblastomas (&lt;10 mm) may be isointense on T1-weighted images and hyperintense on T2-weighted images, with homogeneous contrast enhancement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemangioblastoma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Spinal hemangioblastomas are often associated with a syrinx or spinal cord edema (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F79982\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef79982 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemangioblastoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hemangioblastomas are well-circumscribed, highly vascular red nodules that are often located within the walls of large cysts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F60110\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60110 \">picture 1</a>). On cross-section, these tumors appear beefy red due to their high vascularity and contrast with any adjacent pale cerebellar tissue.</p><p>Microscopically, the two main components of both sporadic and von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)-associated hemangioblastomas are an extensive vascular network and the neoplastic &quot;stromal cells&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F55268\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55268 \">picture 2</a>). The capillaries have a normal structure, including normal endothelial cells and pericytes. Neoplastic stromal cells, embedded among the vascular channels, have abundant cytoplasm packed with lipid vacuoles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemangioblastoma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The numerous lipid-containing vacuoles, which often impinge on the nucleus and scallop its edges, result in the typical &quot;clear cell&quot; morphology. These cells also have large nuclei that are often pleomorphic and hyperchromatic. Such nuclei are considered a degenerative feature rather than a sign of histologic grade, malignant potential or transformation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemangioblastoma/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The mitotic rate is typically low. Where the tumor borders brain, it often forms intertwined small nodules with the host tissue and can occasionally manifest Rosenthal fibers in the adjacent tissue.</p><p>Many of the clear-cell morphologic features of hemangioblastomas overlap with those of renal cell carcinomas (RCCs). RCCs, however, do not show the intimate relationship with the host brain tissue that can be found in a subset of hemangioblastomas, such as the intertwined nodules of brain, but instead have a border pushing against normal tissue. Since RCC is also a frequent manifestation of VHL disease and is histologically similar to hemangioblastomas, immunoperoxidase studies are typically necessary to distinguish these tumors. Unlike RCCs, hemangioblastomas do not have an epithelial origin and so do not typically express cytokeratins or epithelial membrane antigen (EMA), nor do they express CD10, PAX-2, or PAX-8. Furthermore, hemangioblastomas usually display immunoreactivity to inhibin, neuron-specific enolase (NSE), and neural cell adhesion molecule-1 (NCAM-1), unlike RCCs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F69439\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69439 \">picture 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemangioblastoma/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>].</p><p>Retinal angiomas are hemangioblastomas that develop in the retina and within the optic nerve. If left untreated, retinal angiomas can hemorrhage, leading to retinal detachment, glaucoma and loss of vision. Retinal angiomas are a frequent manifestation in patients with VHL disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and management of von Hippel-Lindau disease&quot;, section on 'Retinal capillary hemangioblastomas'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Molecular biology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inactivation of the <em>VHL</em> tumor suppressor gene, located on chromosome 3p, is involved in the pathogenesis of some sporadic as well as VHL-associated hemangioblastomas. Somatic mutations of the <em>VHL</em> gene <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> allelic deletion of the <em>VHL</em> gene may be present in as many as 50 percent of sporadic hemangioblastomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemangioblastoma/abstract/19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-22</a>]. Gain-of-function mutations in hypoxia-inducible factor-2 alpha (<em>HIF2A</em>), which is regulated by <em>VHL</em>, have also been reported in sporadic tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemangioblastoma/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

In fact, expression of both erythropoietin and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is upregulated in the stromal cells of hemangioblastomas and may be involved in the pathogenesis of this disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemangioblastoma/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hemangioblastomas are highly vascular tumors that are often located in neurologically sensitive areas in the neuraxis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F60110\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60110 \">picture 1</a>). The anatomic location of the lesion plays an important role in determining the therapeutic approach. Patients are best managed in a multidisciplinary fashion with input from neurosurgeons, interventional neuroradiologists, radiation oncologists, and neurooncologists with expertise in central nervous system malignancies.</p><p>For patients with von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease, the frequent development of multiple lesions implies that therapeutic efforts should focus on avoiding treatment-related morbidity by minimizing the frequency of surgical interventions. Small asymptomatic lesions can be followed with careful surveillance. Although surgery can usually successfully remove lesions in the spinal cord, brainstem, and cerebellum, intervention is reserved until lesions become symptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemangioblastoma/abstract/26-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-29</a>]. Patients who demonstrate progression by neural imaging should be followed at more frequent intervals for evidence of clinical symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and management of von Hippel-Lindau disease&quot;, section on 'Hemangioblastomas'</a>.)</p><p>Women with existing retinal, brain, and spinal cord lesions are at risk for tumor growth during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemangioblastoma/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. A noncontrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the fourth month of pregnancy may be considered in these patients (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management-of-von-hippel-lindau-disease#H9384234\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and management of von Hippel-Lindau disease&quot;, section on 'Pregnancy and VHL'</a>). Neuroimaging findings, along with clinical signs and symptoms, may be used to make decisions regarding the management of labor and delivery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neurologic-disorders-complicating-pregnancy#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neurologic disorders complicating pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Brain tumors'</a>.)</p><p>Both surgical resection and radiation therapy have a role in the management of appropriately selected patients. However, there are no randomized clinical trials that compare these approaches, nor are there any randomized trials that address the optimal timing of therapeutic intervention.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical resection offers definitive therapy for sporadic, isolated hemangioblastomas, particularly those arising in the cerebellum. The role of surgery in patients with VHL disease is less well defined because of the frequent occurrence of additional synchronous and metachronous lesions.</p><p>Hemangioblastomas are highly vascular, and patients frequently need a preoperative angiogram to identify feeding arteries. For large lesions, embolization of feeding arteries with polymer microspheres, ethanol, or polyvinyl alcohol particles is typically performed prior to surgery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F55268\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55268 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemangioblastoma/abstract/31-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-34</a>]. Following preoperative embolization and using a microdissection technique with an intraoperative microscope, complete surgical resection of a hemangioblastoma is usually feasible with acceptable morbidity.</p><p>The following contemporary series illustrate the outcomes following surgery for patients with hemangioblastomas in the cerebellum, spinal cord, and brainstem:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a series from the National Institutes of Health (NIH), 80 patients with VHL underwent 126 operations, during which 164 cerebellar lesions were resected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemangioblastoma/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Surgery was based upon the presence of symptoms (most frequently headache, ataxia, dysmetria, and hydrocephalus in 75, 55, 29, and 28 percent, respectively). Symptoms improved or stabilized in 98 percent of cases. Follow-up imaging at five years did not document any instances of recurrence.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a Japanese series, 40 of 48 VHL patients with hemangioblastomas of the spinal cord required surgery, including seven patients who required two operations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemangioblastoma/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Among the 48 patients, 46 (96 percent) had associated central nervous system lesions, primarily in the cerebellum. Resection of the spinal tumors resulted in improvement or stabilization of symptoms in 39 of 47 cases (83 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a French series, 34 patients (25 with VHL disease, 9 with sporadic lesions) underwent 40 operations, in which a total of 74 hemangioblastomas were resected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemangioblastoma/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Tumors were located in the brainstem in 14 cases (19 percent) and the remainder were in the spinal cord, predominantly in the cervical and thoracic spine. At a mean follow-up of five years, 82 percent of patients were either improved or stabilized, while 18 percent were worse.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a Japanese series of 36 patients with sporadic hemangioblastomas, gross total resection of the tumor was achieved in 31 of 36 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemangioblastoma/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Younger age and cystic tumor characteristics were associated with a better prognosis. Notably, postoperative hemorrhage occurred in 4 of 19 patients with solid hemangioblastoma and in none of 17 patients with cystic tumors.</p><p/><p>The optimal timing of surgery for patients with a hemangioblastoma is uncertain. The risks associated with operative management include intraoperative bleeding and postoperative neurologic complications.</p><p>The consensus among most neurosurgeons is to follow these patients with surveillance MRI scans of the neuraxis. If there is progression of neurologic symptoms, evidence of tumor or cyst growth, neurologic deficit, or hemorrhage, operative intervention should be considered.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiation therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although there are no randomized clinical trials comparing radiation therapy (RT) with surgery in patients with hemangioblastomas, increasing data with relatively long follow-up support the role of RT, particularly for patients with multiple tumors and those with surgically inaccessible lesions. Most of the contemporary data come from series using stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), although external beam RT or proton beam RT may be useful in selected cases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stereotactic-cranial-radiosurgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stereotactic cranial radiosurgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Contemporary series illustrating the outcomes following RT include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a series of 31 patients (26 with VHL), 92 intracranial and spinal hemangioblastomas were treated with SRS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemangioblastoma/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. At a median follow-up of 69 months, 84 percent of tumors were either unchanged or smaller, and the five-year local control rate was 82 percent. Lesion-associated symptoms were improved in 36 of 41 evaluable cases (88 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another series that included 32 patients (13 with VHL disease), 74 intracranial hemangioblastomas were treated with SRS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemangioblastoma/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. On follow-up imaging, tumor control was achieved for 68 tumors (92 percent). Progression-free survival at five years was 90 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a series of 18 patients (five with VHL disease), 31 hemangioblastomas, including 20 in the cerebellum and 8 in the spinal cord, were treated with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemangioblastoma/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Indications for therapy included recurrence after surgery, residual disease following surgery, or definitive therapy of the lesion in 12, 4, and 2 cases, respectively. With a median follow-up of five years, the five- and 10-year overall survival rates were 69 and 30 percent, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a series of 21 patients (7 sporadic and 14 VHL) who underwent SRS for 57 hemangioblastomas, the actuarial tumor control rates after SRS were 94 and 80 percent at 5 and 10 years, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hemangioblastoma/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Factors associated with longer tumor control on univariate analysis were solid tumor characteristics on imaging, small treatment volume, and tumors associated with VHL.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Antiangiogenic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of the role of vascular endothelial growth factor in the formation of hemangioblastomas, inhibitors of angiogenesis may offer a potential therapeutic approach for lesions not amenable to surgery or radiation therapy.
