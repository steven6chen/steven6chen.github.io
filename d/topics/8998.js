Rib fractures are present in 10 percent of all trauma patients and approximately 30 percent of patients with significant chest trauma. The number of fractured ribs also directly correlates with the presence of intrathoracic injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inpatient-management-of-traumatic-rib-fractures/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. </p><p>Multiply fractured ribs or flail chest can significantly compromise respiratory function. Pneumonia is often the common pathway to acute respiratory failure resulting from rib fractures, and prevention offers the best means to avoid potentially preventable deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inpatient-management-of-traumatic-rib-fractures/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The main goal of treatment is to prevent pneumonia and other complications of rib fractures (eg, nonunion), and conservative treatment includes pain control and aggressive supportive pulmonary care to avoid the need for intubation. For some patients in whom these conservative measures are not adequate, rib fracture stabilization may be beneficial. </p><p>Although less common, chronic, forceful coughing, as may be seen in patients with severe asthma, cystic fibrosis, or poorly controlled emphysema, can also result in rib fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inpatient-management-of-traumatic-rib-fractures/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. General considerations for single or nontraumatic rib fractures are discussed separately.

As such, we recommend the following regarding disposition of the patient:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For limited, isolated traumatic rib injuries (&lt;3 fractures, no associated injuries), outpatient management with oral analgesics and incentive spirometry may suffice.

Every attempt should be made to identify preexisting medical conditions by contacting the patient's primary care physician or family members. The presence of significant medical comorbidities and medical conditions requiring antiplatelets or anticoagulation should be determined, as these may impact management decisions. </p><p>Patients are admitted to a monitored unit or intensive care unit depending upon the number of rib fractures, the nature and severity of associated injuries, and the nature of medical comorbidities. Level of pain, oxygenation and ventilation, and respiratory parameters (eg, incentive spirometry volume) are followed closely with continuous pulse oximetry. (See <a href=\"#H1068085015\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary care and support'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18698277\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical exam</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Physical findings indicative of a rib fracture include rib pain on palpation, rib step-off on palpation, and crepitus. The patient may also feel a sensation of clicking or movement with deep inspiration or with <span class=\"nowrap\">coughing/Valsalva</span> maneuver. Multiple fractures may cause a visible chest wall deformity, and the presence of paradoxical respiratory motion, an area of the chest wall pulled in with inspiration and pushed out with expiration, is diagnostic for flail chest. (See <a href=\"#H1068084913\" class=\"local\">'Flail chest'</a> below.) </p><p>Pneumothorax and hemothorax are often present initially, and their presence should prompt a careful review of all imaging studies for the presence of rib fractures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-rib-fractures#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of rib fractures&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation and examination'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1068084913\"><span class=\"h3\">Flail chest</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Flail chest (ie, &quot;stoved-in&quot; chest, crushed chest) is defined as fractures of three or more ribs in two or more places, which create a floating segment in the chest wall (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F61518\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61518 \">figure 1</a>). Sternal flail occurs when the sternum becomes dissociated from the hemithoraces because of bilateral, multiple, anterior cartilage, or rib fractures. Sternal fracture may also accompany rib fractures. (See <a href=\"#H4110447330\" class=\"local\">'Sternal fracture'</a> below.)</p><p>Flail chest occurs in 5 to 13 percent of patients with chest wall injury. A review of data from the National Trauma Data Bank noted that flail chest occurred in 1 percent of all admissions to Levels 1 and 2 trauma centers included in the dataset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inpatient-management-of-traumatic-rib-fractures/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p>Flail chest is most commonly due to a blunt mechanism of injury whereby significant force is imparted on the chest. Such scenarios can include a motor vehicle collision where the chest strikes the steering wheel, an automobile accident with a pedestrian or bicyclist, a fall from a height onto the chest, an ejection from a motor vehicle or motorcycle, or an assault with a blunt weapon such as a baseball bat. Although less common, flail chest following penetrating trauma (eg, shotgun blast) has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inpatient-management-of-traumatic-rib-fractures/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Because of the severe injury mechanisms associated with flail chest, pulmonary contusion is much more common compared with multiple rib fractures without flail, and these patients have a high risk for acute respiratory failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inpatient-management-of-traumatic-rib-fractures/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p>Flail chest is clinically diagnosed by the observation of paradoxical motion of the chest wall with respiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inpatient-management-of-traumatic-rib-fractures/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Paradoxical chest wall motion arises from the effect of negative pleural forces acting upon the detached segment. The rib cage normally expands upward and outward during inspiration as the diaphragm contracts and flattens, creating the negative intrathoracic pressure necessary to expand the lungs. With flail chest, the detached segment of the chest wall is pulled into the chest cavity during inspiration and pushed outward during expiration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F79746\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79746 \">figure 2</a>). This abnormal motion increases the work of breathing, compromises respiratory function, and may necessitate intubation and ventilatory support. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chest-wall-diseases-and-restrictive-physiology#H388309349\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chest wall diseases and restrictive physiology&quot;, section on 'Normal structure and function'</a>.) </p><p>A flail chest can be missed early in the clinical course because muscle splinting can conceal motion of the involved segment of ribs. It may also be difficult to diagnose in patients who require immediate mechanical ventilation because ventilatory support may minimize paradoxical chest wall motion. Moreover, the pattern of flail can be affected by differential recruitment of chest wall muscles. (See <a href=\"#H68783394\" class=\"local\">'Rib fracture complications'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1068085015\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary care and support'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1068084968\"><span class=\"h2\">Chest imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Computed tomography (CT) of the chest is highly accurate for showing the location and number of rib fractures but is not obtained solely to identify rib fractures. Rather, CT is indicated when there is concern for concomitant injury based upon mechanism of injury or concern for underlying parenchymal injury (eg, aortic injury, pulmonary contusion) or when surgical fracture fixation is being considered. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of blunt thoracic trauma in adults&quot;, section on 'Chest CT: Indications, accuracy, and decision rules'</a> and <a href=\"#H68784133\" class=\"local\">'Intrathoracic injury'</a> below and <a href=\"#H68784637\" class=\"local\">'Surgical management'</a> below.)</p><p>Although standard plain chest radiography is performed during the initial evaluation of chest trauma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F112078\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef112078 \">image 1</a>), it usually underestimates the number of rib fractures and may not detect nondisplaced fractures. It will also usually identify significant pneumothorax or hemothorax and, to some extent, pulmonary contusion. Ultrasound has also been used to establish the number of rib fractures, but this approach remains operator dependent and will only become useful if it impacts management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inpatient-management-of-traumatic-rib-fractures/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p>Two-dimensional chest CT demonstrates rib fractures more reliably than plain chest radiographs. Although a three-dimensional CT scan is less sensitive for the detection of rib fractures, it may provide insight on the characteristics of severely displaced fractures and therefore may be useful for operative planning (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F110952\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef110952 \">image 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inpatient-management-of-traumatic-rib-fractures/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-severe-rib-fractures#H2720389291\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of severe rib fractures&quot;, section on 'Number of fractures to repair'</a>.) </p><p>Rib fractures of the lower rib cage (T8 to T12) can be associated with intra-abdominal injury, and abdominal CT may also be indicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inpatient-management-of-traumatic-rib-fractures/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H18698602\" class=\"local\">'Intra-abdominal injury'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18698528\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSOCIATED INJURIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common mechanisms leading to multiple rib fractures are front- or side-impact motor vehicle collisions that cause contact of the victim with the steering wheel or door. As a result, head injury, abdominal injury, and extremity injury are commonly associated with chest wall injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inpatient-management-of-traumatic-rib-fractures/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The presence of intrathoracic or intra-abdominal injuries relates directly to the site of impact, with injured organs located directly beneath the fractured ribs. The risk of organ injury increases if two or more rib fractures are present at the same level. Fractures to the first two ribs generally require a severe mechanism of injury due to their relative protection by surrounding muscles and short length. These are associated with increased morbidity and mortality from associated injuries. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H68784133\"><span class=\"h2\">Intrathoracic injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pneumothorax, hemothorax, and pulmonary contusion are common in patients with multiple rib fractures. Hemothorax and pneumothorax are usually apparent upon initial presentation; however, delayed hemothorax or pneumothorax can occur.</p><p>Displaced rib fractures can push into the lung, tearing the pulmonary pleura and lung tissue and causing pneumothorax, which occurs in approximately 25 percent of patients with multiple rib fractures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inpatient-management-of-traumatic-rib-fractures/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Pneumothorax is suspected on chest auscultation as diminished breath sounds on the affected side but may also manifest as subcutaneous emphysema with crepitus upon palpation of the chest wall. On chest radiograph, pneumothorax is diagnosed as a radiolucent space where the pulmonary parenchyma has separated from the parietal pleura. On supine radiograph, a deep sulcus sign may be more evident than apical separation. The plain film diagnosis of pneumothorax is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imaging-of-pneumothorax\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Imaging of pneumothorax&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Disruption of the intercostal vessels can lead to bleeding into the chest, particularly when multiple ribs are involved. However, massive hemothorax from intercostal vessel injury alone is rare. When present, significant hemothorax is more likely to be from direct lung parenchymal injury. In the supine position, hemothorax is identified on chest radiograph as a diffuse increase in opacification on the affected side due to the layering of blood posteriorly. The presence of hemothorax in the trauma patient indicates the need for a thoracostomy tube. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-thoracic-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of blunt thoracic trauma in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A large volume of initial chest tube drainage or ongoing bleeding may indicate the need for thoracic exploration. In the presence of upper rib fractures, hemothorax should be assumed to be from a major vascular injury until proven otherwise and not solely attributed to the rib fractures. Laceration of the aorta can occur directly related to the rib fracture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inpatient-management-of-traumatic-rib-fractures/abstract/17-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-21</a>]. Patients with persistent hemorrhage but without injury to the major vasculature may require urgent thoracotomy to ligate the intercostal vessels. </p><p>Pulmonary contusion is due to the transmission of blunt force through the chest wall to the underlying lung parenchyma. Hemorrhage and alveolar collapse result, which have the appearance of focal consolidation on chest radiography. The extent of pulmonary contusion is best evaluated on chest CT. The appearance of the injury progresses over time, and follow-up imaging is needed. (See <a href=\"#H1068085015\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary care and support'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4110447330\"><span class=\"h2\">Sternal fracture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sternal fracture may accompany rib fractures when there is an anterior blow to the chest, such as an impact with the steering wheel in a motor vehicle collision. A palpable sternal step-off may be appreciated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inpatient-management-of-traumatic-rib-fractures/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In one study, sternal fracture occurred in 7 percent of patients with flail chest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inpatient-management-of-traumatic-rib-fractures/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The presence of a sternal fracture should raise concern for blunt cardiac injury, and appropriate workup should be initiated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-injury-from-blunt-trauma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac injury from blunt trauma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Sternal fractures will usually heal without specific intervention but require precautions (limited lifting) once the patient is up and around. Severely displaced sternal fractures may require operative intervention.</p><p>Rarely, patients may have an unstable sternum or complete disruption of bilateral costochondral junction leading to a &quot;flail sternum&quot; with paradoxical movement as would be seen in a flail chest (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F112542\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef112542 \">movie 1</a>). In these instances, operative fixation of the sternum <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> costochondral junction may be beneficial (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F112075\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef112075 \">image 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F112076\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef112076 \">picture 1</a>), although there are no large case series upon which to base this recommendation. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18698602\"><span class=\"h2\">Intra-abdominal injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The spleen and liver are the most commonly injured intra-abdominal organs following blunt trauma, occurring in 2 to 4 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inpatient-management-of-traumatic-rib-fractures/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Fractures of the right lower ribs lead to hepatic injury, fractures of the left lower ribs to splenic injury, and fractures of the posterior portion of the lower ribs can cause renal injury.

Of the three groups studied (flail with head injury, isolated flail, flail plus <span class=\"nowrap\">thoracic/abdominal</span> injury), patients with flail chest and head injury had significantly higher mortality compared with patients without head injury (16 versus 4 and 7 percent).

The probability of pneumonia is directly related to the number of fractured ribs as well as the age of the patient; pneumonia is also a risk factor for developing empyema or respiratory failure. In a review of the National Trauma Data Bank, 59 percent of patients admitted with a flail chest required mechanical ventilation, with a mean duration of 12.1 days and with 54 percent having an associated pulmonary contusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inpatient-management-of-traumatic-rib-fractures/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In-hospital complications included pneumonia in 21 percent, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in 14 percent, and sepsis in 7 percent. Death occurred in 16 percent. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H68783402\"><span class=\"h2\">Pneumonia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pneumonia is one of the most common complications associated with rib fractures. Because pneumonia is the common pathway to death from rib fractures, it is imperative that pain is adequately controlled and aggressive pulmonary support is provided to reduce the risk of pneumonia and avoid the need for intubation, and to facilitate extubation as quickly as possible. (See <a href=\"#H1068084984\" class=\"local\">'Pain control'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1068085015\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary care and support'</a> below.)</p><p>The probability of pneumonia (and death) is directly related to the number of fractured ribs as well as the age of the patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inpatient-management-of-traumatic-rib-fractures/abstract/5-7,10,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7,10,24</a>]. The incidence of pneumonia for all patients hospitalized with one or more rib fractures is approximately 6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inpatient-management-of-traumatic-rib-fractures/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. For patients admitted to a trauma center (presumably with more severe injuries), the incidence is greater [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inpatient-management-of-traumatic-rib-fractures/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Two retrospective studies reported pneumonia in 11 and 17 percent in patients &lt;65 years old but 31 and 34 percent in older patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inpatient-management-of-traumatic-rib-fractures/abstract/6,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,25</a>]. </p><p>In patients with flail chest, the inherent chest wall instability and higher degree of pain associated with deep breathing and coughing lead to a high incidence of acute respiratory failure and need for mechanical ventilation. Pneumonia following intubation for flail chest or multiply fractured ribs is common. The probability of pneumonia is approximately 3 percent for each day the patient is intubated. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4197716567\"><span class=\"h2\">Respiratory failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pain and loss of chest wall function reduce the ability to move the chest wall upward with inspiration and downward with expiration. The altered pulmonary mechanics increase the work of breathing. As a result, the patient is at risk for respiratory muscle fatigue. Respiratory function is worsened by poor pulmonary hygiene from an inability to cough, which can lead to pneumonia. While respiratory failure can be due to the chest wall injury (eg, flail chest), it is more commonly related to an underlying pulmonary contusion or development of nosocomial pneumonia, particularly if superimposed upon a preexisting pulmonary condition. Atelectasis or underlying pulmonary contusion contribute to impaired oxygen exchange as evidenced by an increased alveolar-arterial (A-a) gradient. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H68783409\"><span class=\"h2\">Retained hemothorax</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Retained hemothorax refers to the presence of <span class=\"nowrap\">blood/clot</span> in the thoracic cavity that persists in spite of thoracostomy drainage.

(See <a href=\"#H68783416\" class=\"local\">'Empyema'</a> below.)</p><p>The most accurate means to diagnose a retained hemothorax is with chest CT.

Pain control is fundamental to decrease chest wall splinting and alveolar collapse. Adequate pain management improves patient tolerance for deep breathing and coughing, which improves lung volume and clears secretions, thereby decreasing the risk for pneumonia. Pain control can generally be achieved with a multimodal regimen.

We use an escalating strategy of analgesia that begins with placing the patient on around-the-clock <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inpatient-management-of-traumatic-rib-fractures/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>], a cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 inhibitor, and a low-dose demand-only opioid (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydromorphone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydromorphone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fentanyl-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fentanyl</a>). We prefer to use hydromorphone delivered using patient-controlled analgesia (PCA). Alternative opioid agents can be used; however, morphine should not be used in patients with severely impaired renal function due to the potential buildup of its metabolites and resultant adverse effects. Due to its wide volume of distribution, fentanyl can also accumulate. For those with pain that is refractory to pharmacologic agents, additional pain control involves placement of an epidural or paravertebral catheter for continuous infusion of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ropivacaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ropivacaine</a>. In centers where placement of epidural or paravertebral catheters is not readily available, intercostal blocks are effective for providing non-narcotic-based analgesia.

COX-2 inhibitors, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=celecoxib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">celecoxib</a>, may be safer than the nonselective COX inhibitors, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a>, in patients with a history of gastritis or renal insufficiency. </p><p>Intravenous narcotics (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a>) are preferred over subcutaneous or intramuscular injection due to a rapid and predictable onset of action.

Advocates of paravertebral analgesia cite the following advantages: no need to access the spinal space, thereby lowering the risk of epidural hematoma or infection; less likelihood of sympatholysis with resultant hypotension; and ability to discharge the patient with the catheter in place. In a review of the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB) in the United States that included a total of 194,766 patients admitted for rib fractures, 1073 patients had epidural analgesia and 1110 had paravertebral block.

After propensity score matching, there were no differences for in-hospital mortality, length of stay, intensive care admission or length of intensive care unit stay, mechanical ventilation or duration, development of pneumonia, or other complication.

However, the duration of mechanical ventilation was less for those managed with thoracic epidural analgesia. Higher rates of hypotension were found with thoracic epidural analgesia compared with no epidural analgesia or epidural analgesia at the lumbar level.

The authors noted that while mortality was reduced, epidural analgesia did not reduce pulmonary complications, raising concern that these results were caused by other factors that may be associated with epidural placement and not a direct benefit (causal relationship) from the regional anesthesia. In this study, the majority of the epidural catheters were placed at Level I trauma centers, which are known to be associated with improved outcomes. However, similarly improved outcomes were also demonstrated in a review of a Level II trauma center registry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inpatient-management-of-traumatic-rib-fractures/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. </p><p>The use of epidural catheters in patients with multisystem trauma is often limited because of contraindications to epidural catheter placement (eg, spine fractures, coagulopathy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inpatient-management-of-traumatic-rib-fractures/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-severe-rib-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of severe rib fractures&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H886687\"><span class=\"h1\">MORBIDITY AND MORTALITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An increasing number of rib fractures is clearly associated with increased morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inpatient-management-of-traumatic-rib-fractures/abstract/5-9,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-9,34</a>]. The presence of six or more rib fractures significantly increases the risk for death, often due to associated injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inpatient-management-of-traumatic-rib-fractures/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. A review of data from the National Trauma Data Bank confirmed an increasing risk of pulmonary complications with increasing number of rib fractures but identified age and Injury Severity Score (ISS) as the primary predictors of death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inpatient-management-of-traumatic-rib-fractures/abstract/5,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,9,10</a>]. For each fractured rib, the odds ratio of death increased by 19 percent and the risk of pneumonia increased by 27 percent, in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inpatient-management-of-traumatic-rib-fractures/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Conversely, the odds ratio of death decreases by 40 percent with adequate pain control. Thus, pain control, adequate pulmonary hygiene, and early mobility are the goals of care for patients with severe rib fractures. (See <a href=\"#H1068084976\" class=\"local\">'Management approach and initial care'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1068084984\" class=\"local\">'Pain control'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1068085015\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary care and support'</a> above.)</p><p>An increased number of rib fractures is more common in older patients who are clearly at a higher risk for complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inpatient-management-of-traumatic-rib-fractures/abstract/6,25,70-73\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,25,70-73</a>]. In one study, patients over age 45 with &ge;4 rib fractures had a significantly longer duration of mechanical ventilation and longer hospital stay compared with younger patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inpatient-management-of-traumatic-rib-fractures/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. These data are likely driven by an increased incidence of infectious complications in older patients. For patients &lt;65 years, pneumonia occurs in 11 to 17 percent, whereas for patients &ge;65 years, rates up to 34 percent are reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inpatient-management-of-traumatic-rib-fractures/abstract/6,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,71</a>].<strong> </strong>One other study found that for each additional rib fracture in patients &gt;65 years, the risk of pneumonia increased by 27 percent, and mortality increased by 19 percent. Thus, although outcomes following rib plating have not been studied in patients grouped by age, it may be logical to offer operative intervention more frequently to older patients and to those with a higher number of rib fractures than to younger, less injured patients. (See <a href=\"#H68783402\" class=\"local\">'Pneumonia'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-severe-rib-fractures#H2625574131\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of severe rib fractures&quot;, section on 'Indications'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with uncomplicated rib fractures can have significant short-term disabilities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inpatient-management-of-traumatic-rib-fractures/abstract/35,74,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,74,75</a>], and in one study these patients lost an average of 70 days of work [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inpatient-management-of-traumatic-rib-fractures/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H1068084880\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical findings indicative of a rib fracture include rib pain with palpation, palpable rib step-offs, and crepitus. Patients may also complain of feeling a &quot;clicking&quot; or movement with deep breathing or Valsalva techniques. Multiple fractures may cause a visible chest wall deformity. The presence of paradoxical respiratory motion, an area of the chest wall pulled in with inspiration and pushed out with expiration, is diagnostic for flail chest. (See <a href=\"#H18698277\" class=\"local\">'Physical exam'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flail chest is present when three or more ribs are fractured in two or more places. It occurs in 5 to 13 percent of patients with chest wall injury. Sternal flail occurs when the sternum becomes dissociated from the hemithoraces. Pulmonary contusion is common with flail injuries, and these patients are at high risk for acute respiratory failure. (See <a href=\"#H1068084913\" class=\"local\">'Flail chest'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For limited, isolated rib injuries (&lt;3 fractures), outpatient management with oral analgesics and incentive spirometry may suffice. The presence of &ge;3 rib fractures suggests the need for hospitalization or transfer to a regional trauma facility. Older patients are at increased risk for complications associated with rib fracture, and hospital admission should be considered for any older adult (&gt;65 years) patient. Such patients may benefit from admission to a center with dedicated resources and expertise in management of multiply fractured ribs. (See <a href=\"#H1068084888\" class=\"local\">'Trauma evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Standard plain chest radiographs may show the rib fractures but usually underestimate the number of fractures. The presence of pneumothorax or hemothorax on plain radiographs should prompt re-review of all imaging studies for rib fractures or sternal fracture. Although computed tomography (CT) of the chest is highly accurate for showing the location and number of rib fractures, CT should be reserved for when there is concern for concomitant injury (eg, pulmonary contusion, empyema, aortic injury) or when intervention is being considered. Rib fractures of the lower rib cage (T8 to T12) can be associated with intra-abdominal injury (eg, spleen, liver), and abdominal CT may also be indicated. (See <a href=\"#H1068084968\" class=\"local\">'Chest imaging'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complications of traumatic rib fractures include pneumonia (most common), retained hemothorax or empyema, respiratory failure requiring intubation, and fracture nonunion, which can lead to chronic pain and disability. The probability of pneumonia is directly related to the number of fractured ribs as well as the age of the patient; pneumonia is also a risk factor for developing empyema or respiratory failure. (See <a href=\"#H68783394\" class=\"local\">'Rib fracture complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients with traumatic rib fractures, we suggest initial conservative management rather than surgical rib fracture stabilization (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Conservative management of rib fractures initially involves thoracostomy drainage for <span class=\"nowrap\">pneumothorax/hemothorax</span> (when present) and judicious fluid resuscitation to reduce edema in contused lung. Subsequent management includes aggressive pain control, supportive pulmonary care, and early mobility for volume expansion and managing secretions. A multidisciplinary approach to patients with multiple rib fractures is associated with improved outcomes. (See <a href=\"#H1068084976\" class=\"local\">'Management approach and initial care'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Adequate pain management is fundamental for tolerating deep breathing and coughing. The involvement of a dedicated pain service is important for providing tailored therapy and for monitoring its effectiveness. Pain control can generally be achieved with a multimodal regimen. We use an escalating strategy to control pain. (See <a href=\"#H1068084984\" class=\"local\">'Pain control'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Altered pulmonary mechanics increase the work of breathing and the risk for respiratory failure. Supportive pulmonary measures are aimed at avoiding the need for intubation and include volume expansion using incentive spirometry, and deep breathing and coughing to reduce secretions and prevent atelectasis. Patient who are not intubated need to be monitored closely for respiratory distress. (See <a href=\"#H1068085015\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary care and support'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In spite of appropriate pulmonary support, respiratory fatigue or failure may occur. Intubation may be unavoidable and, when needed, should be performed preemptively under controlled conditions. A trial of noninvasive positive pressure ventilation is warranted for appropriately selected patients in an attempt to avoid mechanical ventilation. Avoidance of intubation altogether and timely extubation among those for whom intubation is required decrease mortality. (See <a href=\"#H1068085015\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary care and support'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical rib stabilization is an option for patients who continue to have acute pain or other problems that interfere with respiratory toilet, those experiencing worsening pulmonary function, or those with rib fractures that do not heal (nonunion) and are causing persistent pain and functional impairment. (See <a href=\"#H68784637\" class=\"local\">'Surgical management'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-severe-rib-fractures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of severe rib fractures&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mortality from multiple rib fractures is directly related to the number of ribs fractured, injury severity (ie, associated injuries), and age. Mortality for patients over the age of 65 approaches 25 percent. A more aggressive approach to pain control, including operative fixation of rib fractures, may be warranted in older patients with severe rib fractures.
