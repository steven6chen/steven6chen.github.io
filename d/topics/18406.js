Subsequent randomized trials confirmed the effectiveness of gold in RA (see <a href=\"#H879785946\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy of parenteral gold in RA'</a> below). Gold has also been used in psoriatic arthritis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis. However, since the 1980s the use of gold has declined due to multiple advantages of other medications, particularly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (MTX), when compared with gold; the benefits of these newer medications include convenience, safety, efficacy, and cost.</p><p>The pharmacokinetics and use of gold in the treatment of RA are reviewed here.

The pharmacokinetics of parenteral and oral gold differ significantly:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=gold-sodium-thiomalate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Gold sodium thiomalate</a><strong> (GST)</strong> &ndash; GST is rapidly absorbed after IM injection, with maximal plasma levels in two to six hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-gold-compounds-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. A decline in levels then follows a two-compartment model: the initial decline is rapid, with a half-life of 9.7 hours; this is followed by a slow decline, with a half-life of 5.2 to 6 days. Gold serum levels rise with weekly administration until a plateau is reached after six to eight weeks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Approximately 40 percent of GST is eliminated, 70 percent in urine and 30 percent in feces. The remainder is retained, and the kidneys, adrenals, and reticuloendothelial system achieve the highest gold concentrations.

With auranofin, 90 to 95 percent is excreted in feces, and 10 percent is excreted in urine. Auranofin is retained to a lesser degree compared with GST. About 300 mg of elemental gold is retained following 20 weekly injections of 50 mg of GST, while only 73 mg of gold is retained after 20 weeks of auranofin (6 mg daily).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11154686\"><span class=\"h2\">Drug interactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no known pharmacologic drug interactions between therapeutic gold compounds and any nonbiologic or biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H879785753\"><span class=\"h1\">USE OF GOLD IN RA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gold can be used to control synovitis and prevent damage in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA); it can be administered either as monotherapy or in combination with other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), including both nonbiologic and biologic DMARDs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-gold-compounds-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. The selection of DMARDs for the treatment of RA is described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alternatives-to-methotrexate-for-the-initial-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Alternatives to methotrexate for the initial treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-rheumatoid-arthritis-in-adults-resistant-to-initial-nonbiologic-dmard-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of rheumatoid arthritis in adults resistant to initial nonbiologic DMARD therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Gold is used most often in certain types of patients since biologic agents for RA have become available. In a series of 71 patients referred for gold therapy for RA between 2007 and 2009, the more common reasons for referral included a suboptimal response to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (MTX) and other DMARDs; limited DMARD options, most often because of liver disease; history of previous benefit with gold; being inappropriate for biologics; and planned pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-gold-compounds-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The most frequently prescribed combinations that included gold compounds were <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gold-sodium-thiomalate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gold sodium thiomalate</a> (GST) plus MTX, and GST plus MTX and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a>. Only 12 of 71 patients were prescribed gold as monotherapy. Gold is also effective for the treatment of Felty's syndrome.</p><p>The oral gold preparation, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=auranofin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">auranofin</a>, is very rarely used because it is less effective than parenteral gold (GST), has diarrhea as a common side effect, and requires close monitoring because of the potential for serious side effects. (See <a href=\"#H11153948\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring oral gold'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1779925\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy of oral gold'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4273639\"><span class=\"h2\">Dose schedules</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7966575\"><span class=\"h3\">Dosing of parenteral gold</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Test doses of GST are given initially, followed usually by weekly dosing until the desired clinical response is achieved; then the frequency of injections is tapered, usually to every two to four weeks, for maintenance therapy. However, the most effective and least toxic dose and schedule for the administration of intramuscular (IM) gold therapy has not been established experimentally. This typical approach has evolved based largely upon case series, several clinical trials, and clinical experience (see <a href=\"#H879785946\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy of parenteral gold in RA'</a> below):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Test doses</strong> &ndash; Test doses of 10 and 25 mg are given one week apart. A reaction to the test dose indicates that the patient will require a modified schedule; doses as low as 1 to 2 mg can be used weekly to desensitize patients with reactions. In patients with an adverse reaction to the 10 mg test dose, we usually reduce the dose to 1 or 2 mg weekly initially, subsequently increasing by 1 to 2 mg every three to four injections as tolerated. In patients who experience side effects at a dose other than the 10 mg test dose, we usually reduce the dose by 50 percent and monitor for adverse effects after subsequent injections. Increases of 10 to 20 percent every month can then be attempted when there are no side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-gold-compounds-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Weekly dosing to achieve clinical response</strong> &ndash; A 50 mg dose is given weekly until remission or low disease activity is reached. Once the target of optimum disease control has been achieved, the frequency of dosing can be reduced for maintenance therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">To achieve and maintain tight control of disease activity, we do not adhere to the conventional gold protocol that historically specified weekly injections until a total accumulated dose of 1 gram had been administered, followed by injections every two to four weeks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Maintenance therapy</strong> &ndash; In patients who have achieved the treatment target, gold administration can be reduced to every two weeks while observing for loss of disease control over two to six months. Attempts may be made to reduce the frequency of dosing to every three to four weeks, if remission is maintained at every two-week dosing intervals; however, in doing so there is a risk of loss of disease control. In the author's experience, tight control often requires injections of gold every one to two weeks indefinitely.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In patients who worsen while on monthly-maintenance gold, resumption of weekly injections often results in improvement in control of disease activity, as was found in a retrospective study in which all 24 patients who relapsed while receiving monthly injections showed improvement upon undergoing retreatment at shorter intervals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-gold-compounds-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Normally, discontinuation of gold is not recommended unless there are potentially serious side effects or loss of effect at optimal tolerated dose. In patients who previously achieved a remission on gold who subsequently discontinue therapy and experience a recurrence of disease activity, a second course of gold is usually effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-gold-compounds-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dosing adjustment for adverse effects</strong> &ndash; Most minor side effects can be managed by temporary discontinuation of therapy with subsequent resumption at a lower dose, but ongoing monitoring for adverse effects is needed (see <a href=\"#H6753923\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring for toxicity'</a> below). As an example, in patients with mucocutaneous side effects, gold should be discontinued until side effects subside, then should be reintroduced at 50 percent lower dose. In patients who tolerate the reduced dose, an incremental increase by 10 to 20 percent after four to eight weeks may be attempted with the goal of achieving a weekly dose that does not cause side effects. In patients who do not tolerate gold at 50 percent of the original dose we reduce the dose by another 50 percent. This approach can be continued until a dose that does not cause side effects is achieved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-gold-compounds-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/14,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,17</a>]. Once we have achieved a weekly dose that does not cause side effects, this is the dose that is administered weekly with the objective of achieving minimal disease activity or remission. In the author's experience, weekly injections may be less than 5 mg and as low as 1 mg with apparent excellent therapeutic benefit when patients cannot tolerate higher doses of gold due to mucocutaneous reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-gold-compounds-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In patients who develop cytopenia or proteinuria of at least 1+ on urine dipstick evaluation, the gold should be held for evaluation and management (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-gold-therapy#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of gold therapy&quot;, section on 'Hematologic toxicity'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-gold-therapy#H20014738\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of gold therapy&quot;, section on 'Proteinuria and membranous glomerulonephritis'</a>). If proteinuria is 1+ on repeat testing, then a 24-hour urine collection should be done.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Combination with other DMARDs</strong> &ndash; Adding a traditional or biologic DMARD to gold is an effective strategy if weekly injection is beneficial but is inadequate to achieve disease control. In such patients, we prefer the use of gold and MTX in combination, given the support for this approach in randomized trials and other studies (see <a href=\"#H12173662\" class=\"local\">'Gold combined with other drugs'</a> below). In our experience, the typical patient receiving this combination will have previously received MTX, but the reintroduction of MTX in patients with a partial response to gold is often well tolerated, whether there had previously been either suboptimal benefit or non-serious side effects at an effective dose of MTX. Other drugs that may be used in combination with gold in patients in whom MTX cannot be used include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulfasalazine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leflunomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leflunomide</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>. Pharmacologic interactions between gold and other nonbiologic or biologic DMARDs have not been reported. (See <a href=\"#H12173662\" class=\"local\">'Gold combined with other drugs'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11153964\"><span class=\"h3\">Dosing of oral gold</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The usual dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=auranofin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">auranofin</a> is 6 mg orally daily (taken as a single dose or 3 mg twice daily).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12172701\"><span class=\"h2\">Contraindications and precautions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gold therapy should be avoided or gold used with particular caution in several types of patients, including those with renal disease, patients being treated with anticoagulants or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, or patients who may have systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Renal disease</strong> &ndash; Renal disease may be an absolute or relative contraindication to the use of gold. Preexisting proteinuria is a relative contraindication to gold therapy because of the difficulty in monitoring for nephrotoxicity. Significant renal failure (creatinine clearance less than 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min)</span> is a contraindication to the use of gold because gold is excreted through the kidneys and because of increased risk of toxicity. In milder chronic kidney disease (creatinine clearance from 50 to 80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min),</span> the dose of gold may be adjusted for renal function by reducing it by 50 percent; patients require careful monitoring. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-gold-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of gold therapy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-gold-therapy#H20013631\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of gold therapy&quot;, section on 'Monitoring for toxicity'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-gold-therapy#H20014738\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of gold therapy&quot;, section on 'Proteinuria and membranous glomerulonephritis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Anticoagulation</strong> &ndash; Concomitant use of anticoagulants requires added caution because of risk of hematomas with IM injection, but we do not consider anticoagulation a contraindication if the patient is otherwise an appropriate candidate for gold therapy. In the author's clinic, the added risks of IM injections are discussed in detail with patients who require anticoagulation for unrelated conditions. We apply local pressure for five minutes after each IM gold injection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors</strong> &mdash; Use of ACE inhibitors is a contraindication to use of GST because severe vasomotor nitritoid reactions have been reported when GST is administered in the presence of these medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-gold-compounds-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. One proposed mechanism for this interaction is based upon the observation that ACE inhibitors inhibit normal breakdown of bradykinin, a metabolite of GST [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-gold-compounds-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Accumulation of bradykinin results in vasodilatation, hypotension, flushing, and nausea; in susceptible subjects, stroke, myocardial infarction, and death have been reported. Other antihypertensive agents may be safely coadministered with gold, including angiotensin receptor blockers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-gold-therapy#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of gold therapy&quot;, section on 'Overview of gold toxicity'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Systemic lupus erythematosus</strong> &ndash; There is an increased risk of an exacerbation (flare) of SLE disease activity in patients treated with gold. Thus, gold should only be used with particular caution in patients who may have an <span class=\"nowrap\">SLE/RA</span> overlap syndrome.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11153734\"><span class=\"h2\">Pregnancy and lactation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gold is generally safe in women planning pregnancy and at the time of conception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-gold-compounds-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-24</a>]. In circumstances in which other management options are not thought to be appropriate, use of gold is acceptable in the view of the author, based upon clinical experience and other published case series. A decision to continue gold therapy should be made after a review together with the patient of the risks of active RA in pregnancy, the benefits of continuing gold therapy in this setting, and the limitations of the available evidence.</p><p>Gold crosses the placenta and is found in the placenta and in the fetus, although harmful effects have not been shown. Gold is present in breast milk in small amounts. It should be assumed that there could be risks of typical gold side effects in exposed infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-gold-compounds-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. These risks should be discussed if a decision is made to continue gold in these settings. The American Academy of Pediatrics classifies gold treatment as compatible with breastfeeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-gold-compounds-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>We also avoid the use of gold in men planning to father a child, because gold may have adverse effects upon male fertility, although this has not been systematically evaluated. In vitro fertilization (IVF) studies in mice have shown GST to have an inhibitory effect on male fertility that appeared related to inhibition of hyaluronidase, which is required for sperm penetration through the follicle cell layer of oocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-gold-compounds-in-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Similar effects might occur with human sperm. The author has treated one male patient with RA who was planning IVF at the time he was referred to start gold. Sperm was stored prior to starting gold. IVF was successful subsequently for two pregnancies, but only with the sperm stored prior to gold and not with sperm produced after starting gold.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6753923\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring for toxicity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients treated with gold must be thoroughly informed about the common and potentially serious side effects of gold therapy.

These medications are used rarely because of the widespread availability of other disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) that have comparable or greater sustained efficacy, lower risk, and greater ease of administration. The mechanism of action remains uncertain.

The most common indications for use of gold include a suboptimal response to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (MTX) and other DMARDs; limited DMARD options, most often because of liver disease; history of previous benefit with gold; being inappropriate for biologics; and planned pregnancy. GST is more efficacious than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=auranofin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">auranofin</a>, and is most often used in combination with MTX, MTX plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a>, or as monotherapy.

Gold is discontinued when adverse effects occur, but may be resumed, usually at a lower dose, once minor side effects have resolved.

Treatment with gold compounds may adversely affect male fertility. (See <a href=\"#H12172701\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications and precautions'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11153734\" class=\"local\">'Pregnancy and lactation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We generally continue gold therapy indefinitely in patients who have achieved the goals of treatment and tolerate the continued administration of the injections, in the absence of potentially serious side effects that mandate permanent drug discontinuation.

In patients able to take MTX, we add MTX to gold after six months of weekly gold therapy in patients with inadequate responses.
