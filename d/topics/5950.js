Specifics regarding airway management techniques are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basic-airway-management-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Basic airway management in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-endotracheal-intubation-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency endotracheal intubation in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-sequence-intubation-rsi-outside-the-operating-room-in-children-approach\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid sequence intubation (RSI) outside the operating room in children: Approach&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMIC CONSIDERATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several anatomic features in infants and children that may impact advanced airway management. Here we discuss the relevant structures and their effect on airway management.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Prominent occiput</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The proportionally larger occiput in infants and younger children causes varying degrees of neck flexion in the supine position. This can result in anatomic airway obstruction or interfere with attempts to visualize the glottic opening during laryngoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-children-unique-pediatric-considerations/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Placing a towel roll under the shoulders can improve airway alignment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F78446\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78446 \">picture 1</a>). This approach is in contrast to placing a pad under the occiput in adults.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Large tongue</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infants and young children have large tongues relative to the size of the oral cavity. Therefore, inadequate control and displacement of the tongue may impede visualization of the deeper airway during direct laryngoscopy. In addition, the tongue becomes a common source of upper airway obstruction, particularly in patients with depressed mental status and concomitant loss of intrinsic airway tone. Retroglossal obstruction occurs in approximately half of obstructions in infants, compared with adults where the vast majority of intrinsic airway obstruction occurs at the level of the soft palate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-children-unique-pediatric-considerations/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Larger tonsils and adenoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children more commonly have larger tonsils and adenoids than adults. Studies utilizing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) have confirmed that this increased mass of lymphoid tissue contributes to airway obstruction in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-children-unique-pediatric-considerations/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In addition, adenoidal bleeding can occur with placement of a nasopharyngeal airway or attempts at nasotracheal intubation. Resultant blood in the naso- and hypopharynx can lead to aspiration and make glottic visualization challenging.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Superior laryngeal position</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The position of the larynx in infants and children is more cephalad than in adults. It is located opposite the C3 to C4 vertebrae, compared with the C4 to C5 in adults (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F50850\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50850 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F62656\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62656 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-children-unique-pediatric-considerations/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. This creates a more acute angle between the glottic opening and the base of the tongue, which can make direct visualization more challenging.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Weaker hyoepiglottic ligament</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hyoepiglottic ligament runs at the base of the vallecula, attaching the epiglottis to the base of the tongue. In young children, it has less tensile strength; therefore curved blades designed for tip placement in the vallecula (eg, Macintosh) may not elevate the epiglottis as effectively as in adults.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Large, floppy epiglottis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The epiglottis is relatively large and floppy in children, particularly those younger than three years of age. It is also angled more acutely with respect to the axis of the trachea. As a result, the epiglottis projects into the airway and covers more of the glottic aperture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F50850\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50850 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F62656\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62656 \">figure 2</a>). Effective mobilization of the epiglottis also favors the use of a straight blade to directly lift the epiglottis for improved visualization during direct laryngoscopy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F70746\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70746 \">figure 3</a>). Infants and young children with laryngomalacia may have an omega-shaped epiglottis that can lead to positional, inspiratory stridor and can give the appearance of a thickened epiglottis on lateral airway radiographs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-children-unique-pediatric-considerations/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Shorter trachea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The trachea increases in length with age, from approximately 5 cm in neonates to 12 cm in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-children-unique-pediatric-considerations/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. The short trachea predisposes to right mainstem bronchus intubation or inadvertent extubation, given the short segment within which an endotracheal tube (ETT) can be correctly placed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-children-unique-pediatric-considerations/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. This can occur at the time of intubation, or during unintentional head movement, which has been shown to displace ETTs as much as 1 cm in neonates and 2 cm in older children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-children-unique-pediatric-considerations/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Narrow trachea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to being shorter, the trachea in younger children is also narrow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-children-unique-pediatric-considerations/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Because airway resistance is inversely proportional to the lumen radius to the fourth power, even small decreases in the airway size from secretions, edema, or external compression (including cricoid pressure, in circumstances in which it is felt to be beneficial) will have disproportionate effects on these smaller airways (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F66343\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66343 \">figure 4</a>). The narrow tracheal lumen, combined with the narrow space between tracheal rings and small size of the cricothyroid membranes, makes needle or surgical cricothyroidotomy technically challenging in infants and children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-children-unique-pediatric-considerations/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-difficult-pediatric-airway\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The difficult pediatric airway&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Anatomic subglottic narrowing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In adults, the vocal cords comprise the narrowest portion of the airway. Historically, the cricoid ring has been identified as the narrowest portion of the pediatric airway in cadaveric studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-children-unique-pediatric-considerations/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. More recent data suggest that the airway in children may <strong>not</strong> be conical or funnel-shaped as previously believed. Measurements taken during magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and bronchoscopy show that the cross sectional area is smaller at the vocal cords than the subglottis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-children-unique-pediatric-considerations/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Similarly, airway imaging using MRI and computed tomography including both cross sectional and three-dimensional reconstructions show no difference in the cross sectional area between the subglottis and the cricoid ring. The shape of the cricoid ring does change with age, with an elliptical shape in infants and evolving to a circular shape similar to adults in older children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-children-unique-pediatric-considerations/abstract/16,18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,18-20</a>]. </p><p>As a result of the elliptical shape of the subglottis and cricoid cartilage, particularly in infants, foreign bodies can become lodged below the cords, and resistance during endotracheal tube (ETT) passage may increase at this level. Cuffed ETTs can effectively fill the elliptical shape of the subglottic airway and reduce the likelihood of air leak around the tube. With the advent of newer, smaller profile, lower pressure cuffed tubes, the American Heart Association now has approved cuffed ETTs for all pediatric patients outside the newborn period, provided the cuff pressure can be maintained at less than 20 cm H<sub>2</sub>O [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-children-unique-pediatric-considerations/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In addition, use of a cuffed ETT in children is associated with a reduced need for ETT exchanges and no increase in post-extubation morbidity when compared to uncuffed tubes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-endotracheal-intubation-in-children#H1618840\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency endotracheal intubation in children&quot;, section on 'Cuffed versus uncuffed'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Compliant chest wall</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The thoracic skeleton in children is primarily cartilaginous and therefore more compliant than the ossified bony structures in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-children-unique-pediatric-considerations/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Intrinsic muscle tone is required to maintain lung volumes and prevent chest wall distortion. Therefore, infants and young children are more likely to experience respiratory muscle fatigue, atelectasis and respiratory failure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSIOLOGIC CONSIDERATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Age-specific physiologic features in infants and children can also affect advanced airway management. Here we discuss those processes which are different in children, and how they impact assessment and management of the pediatric airway.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Age-related respiratory rate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Normative ranges for vital signs vary by age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F78097\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78097 \">table 1</a>). Variation in patterns may also occur, such as periodic breathing which occurs commonly in the first six months of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-children-unique-pediatric-considerations/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Discriminating normal from concerning vital sign values and trends is paramount in assessing respiratory illness and response to therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Preferential nasal breathing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infants are commonly believed to be obligate nasal breathers. Some data suggest that a subset of infants will fail to initiate mouth breathing within a prescribed time after nasal occlusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-children-unique-pediatric-considerations/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]; however, others have shown infants can breathe through their mouths spontaneously or following nasal airflow obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-children-unique-pediatric-considerations/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. For the majority of infants who are nasal breathers, the nares account for nearly half the total airway resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-children-unique-pediatric-considerations/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Therefore, obstruction by secretions, edema, or compression from non-flowing nasal cannula or a misplaced face mask can lead to significant increase in the work of breathing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Smaller tidal volumes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infants and young children have small, relatively fixed tidal volumes relative to body size (6 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg)</span>. As a result, they are susceptible to iatrogenic barotrauma from aggressive positive pressure ventilation. In addition, the limited ability to increase minute ventilation with deeper breathing means that any compensatory response to physiologic demands for increased minute volume is most likely to be manifest as tachypnea. Limited sustainability of rapid respiratory rates predisposes young infants to respiratory failure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Lower functional residual capacity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Functional residual capacity (FRC) increases with age during childhood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-children-unique-pediatric-considerations/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. Therefore, young children have little intrapulmonary oxygen stores to utilize during hypoventilatory or apneic periods. Apneic infants and toddlers, in particular, have a more precipitous decline in oxygen saturation, for example, when they undergo rapid sequence intubation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-children-unique-pediatric-considerations/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. For this reason, children have a heightened need for preoxygenation and, possibly, bag-mask ventilation during rapid sequence induction for intubation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-sequence-intubation-rsi-outside-the-operating-room-in-children-approach#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid sequence intubation (RSI) outside the operating room in children: Approach&quot;, section on 'Preoxygenation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Higher oxygen metabolism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infants have a higher metabolic rate and consume oxygen at a rate twice that of adults (6 versus 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg/min)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-children-unique-pediatric-considerations/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. This higher oxygen consumption, coupled with the lower FRC in children, results in a shorter safe apnea time. In a study of preoxygenated ASA I children (ie, healthy, no medical problems), the mean time to oxygen desaturation to 90 percent ranged from 1.5 minutes in children less than six months to more than six minutes in children greater than 11 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-children-unique-pediatric-considerations/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Prone to respiratory fatigue</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infants and younger children have a lower percentage of efficient, slow-twitch (type 1) skeletal muscle fibers in their intercostal muscles than older patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-children-unique-pediatric-considerations/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Therefore, when children utilize retractions to facilitate airflow during respiratory distress, they are more prone to fatigue, and ultimately, respiratory failure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Higher vagal tone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infants and young children may have a pronounced vagal response to laryngoscopy or airway suctioning. Because hypoxia potentiates the risk for bradycardia, efforts to maintain oxygenation before and during endotracheal intubation should be maximized. </p><p>The role for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">atropine</a> in preventing bradycardia during airway management is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-sequence-intubation-rsi-outside-the-operating-room-in-children-approach#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid sequence intubation (RSI) outside the operating room in children: Approach&quot;, section on 'Pretreatment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h1\">LIMITED OPPORTUNITY TO GAIN PROFICIENCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Laryngoscopy and endotracheal intubation are complex psychomotor skills that require sufficient training and practice to achieve and maintain proficiency. Studies including neonatal, pediatric, and adult populations have shown that intubation success increases by level of training [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-children-unique-pediatric-considerations/abstract/33-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-36</a>]. As an example, in an observational study that evaluated first-time success rates for 114 pediatric rapid sequence intubations in children&rsquo;s hospital emergency departments, pediatric emergency medicine attendings had a higher first-time success rate (89 percent) than pediatric emergency medicine fellows (43 percent) or pediatric residents (35 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-children-unique-pediatric-considerations/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. More specifically, learning curves for anesthesia resident clinicians in a controlled setting showed that after 10 intubations the success rate was less than 50 percent, and only after 57 intubations did these trainees achieve a 90 percent success rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-children-unique-pediatric-considerations/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. For non-anesthesia trainees, success also increased with experience, with a predicted 90 percent rate of &quot;good&quot; intubations achieved after 47 prior attempts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-children-unique-pediatric-considerations/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>In pediatrics, advanced airway management experience for many providers outside of anesthesia may be limited. Comparing data from pediatric and adult tertiary care emergency departments, health care providers have less frequent opportunities to perform intubation in children than in adults. A survey of pediatric emergency departments suggests a range of 1.1 to 3.3 intubations per 1000 patients per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-children-unique-pediatric-considerations/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>], while studies based in adult facilities demonstrate 6 to 10 intubations per 1000 patients per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-children-unique-pediatric-considerations/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. This demonstrated need for extensive experience, in contrast to the infrequent opportunities to perform advanced airway techniques in children, also needs to be considered in pediatric airway management. Simulation training can provide an alternative means for pediatric airway management training [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-children-unique-pediatric-considerations/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>Rescue ventilation devices such as the laryngeal mask airway, esophageal-tracheal combination tube (Combitube&reg;), or laryngeal tube provide alternatives to endotracheal intubation, and are more likely to be placed correctly than endotracheal tubes by providers with limited prior experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/emergency-airway-management-in-children-unique-pediatric-considerations/abstract/43-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-50</a>]. Thus, health care providers who will be involved in airway management should develop comfort and familiarity with at least one rescue ventilation device. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-rescue-devices-for-difficult-pediatric-airway-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency rescue devices for difficult pediatric airway management&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although the indications for airway management in children are similar to those in adults, unique pediatric anatomy and physiology create specific challenges in assessment and management:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Anatomic structures in children predispose them to airway obstruction and significantly impact pediatric airway management. For example, the larger oropharyngeal structures (tongue, tonsils, and adenoids) and the large floppy epiglottis lead to greater difficulty in visualizing the vocal cords during laryngoscopy. Also, the shorter and narrower trachea predisposes to endotracheal tube malposition after intubation. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Anatomic considerations'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Infants and children become hypoxemic more quickly than adults because of decreased functional residual capacity and increased oxygen consumption. These physiologic differences result in a shorter and less safe apnea time during rapid sequence intubation (RSI), emphasizing the need for adequate preoxygenation and occasionally, bag-mask ventilation during RSI. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Physiologic considerations'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rapid-sequence-intubation-rsi-outside-the-operating-room-in-children-approach\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rapid sequence intubation (RSI) outside the operating room in children: Approach&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Developing competence and maintaining proficiency with advanced airway management is particularly challenging in children because of the relative infrequency with which most practitioners utilize these skills.
