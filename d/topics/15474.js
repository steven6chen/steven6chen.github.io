Detection of hearing loss during infancy can initiate intervention resulting in improved language, cognitive, behavioral, and academic outcomes.</p><p>Screening for hearing loss in the newborn will be reviewed here. The etiology, evaluation, and management of hearing impairment in children are discussed separately.

Cochlear function remains normal because the inner ear develops separately from the external and middle ears. Conductive hearing loss may be either transient (middle ear fluid) or permanent (anatomical). Transient conductive hearing loss is a frequent cause of a false-positive neonatal screen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-the-newborn-for-hearing-loss/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) results from malfunction of inner ear structures, including the outer and inner hair cells of the cochlea and the eighth cranial nerve components of the auditory neural pathway.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Auditory neuropathy (AN) is a hearing disorder that affects the neural processing of auditory stimuli and may involve the eighth cranial nerve, auditory brain stem, or cerebral cortex. Sound enters the inner ear (cochlea and outer hair cells) normally, but the transmission of signals from the inner hair cells of the cochlea to the auditory <span class=\"nowrap\">nerve/pathway</span> is either absent or severely distorted. Screening for hearing loss using otoacoustic emissions will not detect patients with AN, as their outer hair cells function normally.

In the United States, data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (<a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/hearingloss/2014-data/2014_ehdi_hsfs_summary_h.pdf&amp;token=mbhJQyzGtZVeyDUa6amVsWfO+xQn93128OHYQW/maFe3E/fQIII5QKeMDPJw8JbJQtDoeT2i7fwnSj9JrZdlEqp87zavDkoSKhlq/Fp4U2w=&amp;TOPIC_ID=4985\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">2014 CDC Early Hearing Detection and Identification</a>) reported a rate of permanent hearing loss of 1.6 per 1000 infants screened for hearing loss, with an overall screening rate of 98 percent for all newborns, excluding infant deaths and parental refusal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-the-newborn-for-hearing-loss/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. There was no documented diagnosis reported in 42 percent of infants who failed the newborn hearing screening.</p><p>The prevalence of moderate, severe, and profound bilateral permanent hearing loss is estimated at 1 in 900 to 2500 newborns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-the-newborn-for-hearing-loss/abstract/5,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8</a>]. The prevalence of unilateral hearing impairment above 30 decibels (dB) has been reported as 6 out of 1000 newborns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-the-newborn-for-hearing-loss/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The causes of hearing loss remain unidentified in one-quarter to one-half of infants and children with permanent hearing loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-the-newborn-for-hearing-loss/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. For patients with a confirmed diagnosis, hearing loss is due to <span class=\"nowrap\">genetic/hereditary</span> disorders or acquired conditions due to perinatal problems (eg, congenital viral infections). Permanent hearing loss is often associated with other abnormalities, and there are over 400 syndromes reported to be associated with permanent hearing loss (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F66758\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66758 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hearing-loss-in-children-etiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hearing loss in children: Etiology&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3665114734\"><span class=\"h2\">NICU patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infants cared for in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), which includes both neonatal level 2 and 3 care units, are at greater risk of hearing loss compared with healthy term infants. In particular, sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and auditory neuropathy (AN) are much more common for infants cared for in the NICU, with reported rates of SNHL and AN of 16.7 and 5.6 per 1000 infants, respectively, compared with an estimated incidence of AN in a well-baby population of 0.06 per 1000 infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-the-newborn-for-hearing-loss/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. If infants with hyperbilirubinemia are included in the well-baby population, the incidence rises to 0.3 per 1000 infants, still one-tenth of the rate seen in infants cared for in the NICU.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">RATIONALE FOR SCREENING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Screening newborns for hearing loss leads to earlier detection and intervention in patients with congenital hearing impairment. Early intervention can improve language acquisition and educational achievement in affected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-the-newborn-for-hearing-loss/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Earlier detection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evidence is clear that screening newborns detects hearing loss at a significantly earlier age than relying solely on identifying clinical signs of hearing loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-the-newborn-for-hearing-loss/abstract/14-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-18</a>]. Caregivers and clinicians are not able to detect hearing loss in infants until there is recognition of delayed speech and language milestones.</p><p>This point was best illustrated by a controlled trial of 53,781 neonates born in four English hospitals from 1993 to 1996 that alternated periods of time between universal newborn hearing screening (UNHS) and no screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-the-newborn-for-hearing-loss/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Overall, 106 cases of bilateral permanent hearing impairment per 100,000 target population were identified. After adjustment for severity of hearing loss, infants with hearing loss born during periods of screening compared with those born during periods without screening were more likely to be detected at an earlier age (odds ratio [OR] 5, 95% CI 1-23) and to receive earlier intervention (OR 8, 95% CI 1.5-41). In a follow-up study, the proportion of seven- to nine-year-old children with permanent hearing impairment who were identified before six months of age was higher during periods of UNHS compared with periods of no screening (74 versus 31 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-the-newborn-for-hearing-loss/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Earlier diagnosis improves outcome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based on several controlled studies of long-term outcome, the evidence supports that earlier diagnosis and intervention for permanent hearing loss in infants can improve language and developmental outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-the-newborn-for-hearing-loss/abstract/1,20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,20-23</a>].</p><p>The beneficial effect of early detection and intervention on language development was best demonstrated in a follow-up study of 120 children with bilateral permanent hearing loss who were from the birth cohort of the previously mentioned trial comparing UNHS with no screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-the-newborn-for-hearing-loss/abstract/14,19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,19-21</a>]. The following findings were noted when children who were diagnosed with hearing loss by nine months of age were compared with those diagnosed after nine months of age when evaluated at eight years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-the-newborn-for-hearing-loss/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All children who were detected by nine months of age had been identified by UNHS.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children whose permanent hearing loss was confirmed by nine months of age compared with those with confirmation after nine months of age had better receptive and general language abilities as assessed by study research staff.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There was no difference by parent report in speech development between the two groups.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There were no differences in the severity of hearing loss, the frequency of other disabilities (such as cerebral palsy, visual impairment, and learning disability), or socioeconomic status between the two groups.</p><p/><p>In subsequent follow-up reports, patients from this cohort who were identified before nine months had better reading and communication skills than those diagnosed after nine months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-the-newborn-for-hearing-loss/abstract/20,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,22</a>]. The benefit for reading comprehension at primary school age increased through adolescence.</p><p>A subsequent study of children two to six years of age with mild to severe hearing loss reported factors in addition to the age of identification associated with improved language outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-the-newborn-for-hearing-loss/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Amplification with hearing aids (HA) by six months, greater duration of use of HA, decreased severity of hearing loss, and increased audibility with HA were associated with better early language skills.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">SCREENING TESTS FOR HEARING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) Task Force on Newborn and Infant Hearing defined an effective neonatal hearing screening test as one that detects hearing loss of &ge;35 decibels (dB) in the better ear and is reliable in infants &le;3 months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-the-newborn-for-hearing-loss/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Two electrophysiologic techniques meet these criteria:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Automated auditory brainstem responses (AABR)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Otoacoustic emissions (OAE)</p><p/><p>Both AABR and OAE techniques are inexpensive, portable, reproducible, and automated. They evaluate the peripheral auditory system and the cochlea, but cannot assess activity in the highest levels of the central auditory system. These tests alone are <strong>not</strong> sufficient to diagnose hearing loss; thus, any child who fails one of these screening tests requires further audiologic evaluation. In addition, both methods will miss mild hearing loss. (See <a href=\"#H106626733\" class=\"local\">'Infants who fail screening'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hearing-impairment-in-children-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hearing impairment in children: Evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Automated auditory brainstem response</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AABR measures the summation of action potentials from the eighth cranial nerve (cochlear nerve) to the inferior colliculus of the midbrain in response to a click stimulus. It can detect both sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and auditory neuropathy (AN). Other names for this test include the screening ABR (SABR), and screening brainstem auditory evoked response (BAER). Approximately 4 percent of infants screened with AABR are referred for further audiologic evaluation, which uses a diagnostic ABR including an evaluation by an audiologist skilled in assessing infants and young children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-the-newborn-for-hearing-loss/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>]. It is important to note the difference between AABR and ABR, as AABR is a screening tool with an automated <span class=\"nowrap\">pass/fail</span> response whereas an ABR diagnostic test provides quantitative data (eg, waveforms) that must be interpreted by a trained audiologist, thereby determining the degree and the site of the hearing loss. As an example, delayed or absent waves suggest a neurologic or cochlear deficit. Many neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) now complete the diagnostic ABR prior to discharge for infants who fail the screening AABR.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The AABR utilizes click or chirp stimuli presented at 35 dB. Three surface electrodes placed on the forehead, nape, and mastoid or shoulder detect waveform recordings generated by the ABR to the stimuli. In the screening AABR, the morphology and latency of the waveforms are compared with normal neonatal templates, and a pass or fail reading is generated, and the examiner does not need to interpret the waveforms if visibly accessible. AABR screening typically requires 4 to 15 minutes for testing, although newer AABR screening equipment can complete testing in an infant in 4 to 8 minutes in ideal conditions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Otoacoustic emissions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>OAE testing measures the presence or absence of sound waves (ie, OAEs) generated by the cochlear outer hair cells of the inner ear in response to sound stimuli. A microphone at the external ear canal detects these low-intensity OAEs. Since OAE evaluates hearing from the middle ear to the outer hair cells of the inner ear, it is used to screen for SNHL but cannot detect AN.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The apparatus for OAE screening consists of a miniature microphone placed into the infant's outer ear canal. The microphone produces a stimulus (clicks or tones) and detects sound waves as they arise from the cochlea. The device also measures the signal-to-noise ratio to ensure accuracy. OAE screening generally requires approximately one to two minutes per ear in ideal testing conditions.</p><p>Tests most commonly used for clinical purposes are transient OAEs (TOAEs) and distortion product OAEs (DPOAEs). They are classified by the stimuli used to produce the cochlear basal membrane vibrations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Comparison of AABR and OAE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following is a comparison between the automated auditory brainstem response (AABR) and otoacoustic emissions (OAE) screening methods:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Test time &minus; OAE tends to require less patient preparation time and a shorter test time than AABR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-the-newborn-for-hearing-loss/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. AABR may also present time constraints because infants need to be asleep or quiet awake when tested. In contrast, OAE can be performed when the infant is awake, feeding, or sucking on a pacifier [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-the-newborn-for-hearing-loss/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Response time, however, is much quicker for OAE if the infant is sleeping or quiet awake.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Interference &minus; OAE is sensitive to background noise, and physiological noise generated by the baby [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-the-newborn-for-hearing-loss/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. It may be difficult to obtain OAE responses at low frequencies due to physiological noise, myogenic noise, or poor acoustics. This noise interference is greater when the recorded frequency is below 1500 Hertz (Hz). Thus, screening with OAE can be improved by programming protocol parameters to include select high frequencies, which are more important for understanding speech [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-the-newborn-for-hearing-loss/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>]. These protocol changes should be implemented by an audiologist with a specialized skillset in pediatrics. OAE, unlike AABR, is not subject to muscle artifact [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-the-newborn-for-hearing-loss/abstract/30,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,34</a>]. AABR can also be complicated by electrical artifacts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-the-newborn-for-hearing-loss/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>False-positive results &minus; During the first three days of life, there is an increased false-positive rate with OAE compared with AABR, most commonly due to transient conductive hearing loss caused by vernix occluding the external ear canal or middle ear fluid (due to amniotic fluid). [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-the-newborn-for-hearing-loss/abstract/34-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-37</a>]. In several reports, 19 to 25 percent of newborns with abnormal OAE screening during the first three days after birth had subsequent normal hearing in follow-up testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-the-newborn-for-hearing-loss/abstract/36-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-39</a>]. In one study, cleaning of vernix increased the pass rates from 59 to 69 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-the-newborn-for-hearing-loss/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">It is important to recognize that the pass threshold is higher for OAE than for AABR, resulting in a higher fail rate. Both methods will miss minimal and mild hearing loss.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tympanic membrane mobility &minus; OAE requires normal middle ear function. Thus, decreased tympanic membrane mobility can reduce screening pass rates with this technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-the-newborn-for-hearing-loss/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The magnitude of this problem was illustrated in a series of 200 infants, in which the pass rate in the 23 percent of infants with decreased tympanic membrane mobility was lower with OAE than AABR (33 versus 95 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-the-newborn-for-hearing-loss/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. This issue is not currently assessed in screening programs in the United States.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AN &minus; Infants at risk for developing AN include those with severe hyperbilirubinemia, prematurity, perinatal asphyxia, craniofacial abnormalities, and others who are admitted to neonatal intensive care units (NICUs). AABR will detect the hearing loss in infants with AN, but OAE will not. Therefore screening for AN with OAE may lead to a false-negative result [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-the-newborn-for-hearing-loss/abstract/30,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,40</a>]. Thus, AABR should always be used to screen hearing in infants who are at risk for AN (eg, infants with hypoxia, prematurity, hyperbilirubinemia, neurologic impairment and all infants who require &ge;5 days of NICU care).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relative costs &minus; Although the actual screening cost is lower for OAE compared with AABR, the overall cost of screening and audiologic evaluation may be lower with AABR because of the lower referral rate for diagnostic audiologic assessment, although this varies by location.

Infants cared for in neonatal level of 2 and 3 care units (neonatal intensive care units [NICU]) are at-risk for sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) and auditory neuropathy (AN). (See <a href=\"#H316694314\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Newborn screening detects hearing loss at an earlier age, resulting in earlier intervention (eg, use of hearing devices and access to language [speech or sign]). Earlier detection and intervention (before 10 months of age) improves language and reading development. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Rationale for screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two electrophysiologic techniques, automated auditory brainstem responses (AABR) and otoacoustic emissions (OAE), are routinely used as screening tests. Both tests are portable, automated, and inexpensive, making them well suited to newborn screening. However, OAE does not detect AN and AABR should be used to screen infants who are at risk for AN. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Screening tests for hearing'</a> above and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'NICU admissions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Universal screening for hearing loss is preferred because targeted selective screening for only at-risk infants would fail to identify 50 to 75 percent of all cases of moderate to profound bilateral hearing loss. As a result, hearing loss in a substantial number of hearing-impaired neonates would be delayed with only selective screening. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Risk Factors for Hearing Loss'</a> above and <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Universal screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All states in the United States have implemented universal newborn hearing screening (UNHS) programs and most states have laws mandating UNHS. Clinicians should be familiar with their state laws.

(See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Implementation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The two types of UNHS include one-stage, which utilizes a single screening test (ie, AABR or OAE), or two-stage, which utilizes two screening tests or repeats the same test. In the two-stage UNHS, only patients who fail the initial test receive a second screening study, and only patients who fail both tests are referred for audiologic assessment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F115420\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef115420 \">algorithm 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F115419\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef115419 \">algorithm 2</a>).

At many birthing centers, OAE is the initial test in healthy term infants because of lower cost and ease of administration, followed by AABR if the OAE is abnormal. For infants admitted to the NICU, we use AABR to screen for hearing loss as they are at risk for AN. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Protocols'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1542319055\" class=\"local\">'Approach to birth hospitalization screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If a one-stage UNHS is utilized in the well-baby nursery, AABR should be used as the screening test versus OAE. (See <a href=\"#H3748585414\" class=\"local\">'Well-baby nursery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infants who fail a screening test require additional audiologic evaluation by three months of age.

Therefore, a normal hearing screen should not be completely reassuring. Monitoring of infants for hearing loss should continue during routine primary care visits, particularly in those who are at risk <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> in those who failed the initial stage of screening of a two-stage UNHS. Infants who pass the neonatal screening but have a risk factor for hearing loss (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74313\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74313 \">table 2</a>) should have audiologic assessment performed by a pediatric audiologist.
