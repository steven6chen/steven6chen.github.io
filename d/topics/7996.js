Treatment is most successful when it is tailored to your needs.</p><p>The treatment of tension, chronic daily, medication overuse, and cluster headaches will be reviewed here (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F76857\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76857 \">table 1</a>). Migraine headaches are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=migraine-headaches-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Migraine headaches in adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The causes and diagnosis of headache are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=headache-causes-and-diagnosis-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Headache causes and diagnosis in adults (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.) A discussion of headaches in children is also available. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=headache-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Headache in children (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">HEADACHE TREATMENT TYPES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Headache treatment depends upon the frequency, severity, and symptoms of your headache.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute treatment refers to medicines you can take when you have a headache to relieve the pain immediately.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preventive treatment refers to medicines you can take on a regular (usually daily) basis to prevent headaches in the future.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">TENSION TYPE HEADACHE TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tension type headaches that occur less than 15 times per month can usually be treated with a pain reliever. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tension-type-headache-in-adults-acute-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tension-type headache in adults: Acute treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Pain reliever</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A pain reliever may be recommended first for the treatment of tension type headache. These drugs include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aspirin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acetaminophen (eg, Tylenol&reg;)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen (eg, Motrin or Advil), indomethacin, or naproxen (eg, Naprosyn or Aleve).</p><p/><p>Mild pain relievers are also available in combination with caffeine, which enhances the drug's effect. As an example, Excedrin&reg; contains a combination of acetaminophen-aspirin-caffeine. This combination may be recommended if a pain reliever alone does not relieve the headache.</p><p>Pain relievers should not be used too often because overuse can lead to medication-overuse headaches or chronic daily headaches. If you respond to a pain reliever, you should continue taking these with each headache. However:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not use pain relievers more than nine days per month on average, or more than two doses per episode.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If a pain reliever does not control your headache, talk to your healthcare provider for other suggestions.</p><p/><p>People with gastritis (inflammation of the stomach), ulcers, kidney disease, and bleeding conditions should not take products containing aspirin or NSAIDs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Combination medicines containing butalbital and opioids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Combinations of an opioid (narcotic) and a pain reliever are available, but are generally not recommended since they are habit-forming and can increase the risk of medication-overuse headaches and chronic daily headaches. Even so, such medications may be considered in special situations where simple pain relievers are ineffective or contraindicated (eg, women in the third trimester of pregnancy, patients with ulcers, severe kidney failure, or liver failure). When healthcare providers encounter patients who are using opioids and barbiturates inappropriately, a &quot;stop or brake&quot; policy may be put into place. The use of these medications is then either stopped, or the frequency of use is braked by limiting them to no more than two days per week and 18 tablets per month.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Preventive treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preventive therapy is recommended for people with tension-type headaches that are frequent, long lasting, or account for a significant amount of total disability. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tension-type-headache-in-adults-preventive-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tension-type headache in adults: Preventive treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Antidepressant medicines called tricyclics (TCAs) are often used to help prevent frequent tension headaches. Examples of TCAs include amitriptyline (used most commonly), nortriptyline, and protriptyline. The dose of TCAs used for people with headaches is typically much lower than that used for treating depression. It is believed that these drugs reduce pain perception when used in low doses, although it is not exactly clear how the medicines work.</p><p>It is common to feel tired when you start taking TCAs; this is not always an undesirable side effect since it can help improve sleep if you take TCAs in the evening. TCAs are generally started in low doses and increased gradually. Their full effect may not be seen for weeks to months.</p><p>Tricyclic antidepressants are sometimes used in combination with behavioral therapy to prevent tension-type headaches. The goal of behavioral therapy is to identify and try to avoid behaviors that can trigger a headache. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Lifestyle changes'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">CHRONIC DAILY HEADACHE TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management of chronic daily headache depends on the type of background headache (eg, chronic migraine or chronic tension-type headache) and the presence or absence of medication overuse. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-chronic-daily-headache#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of chronic daily headache&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The treatment of chronic migraine should focus on preventive therapy while avoiding migraine triggers and limiting the use of acute headache medications to avoid medication overuse headache. Preventive treatments include medicines, behavioral therapy, or physical therapy. Management often requires the simultaneous use of these different treatments. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-migraine#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic migraine&quot;, section on 'Management'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For chronic tension-type headache, effective treatment involves the use of daily preventive medications (eg, tricyclic antidepressants), behavioral therapies and physical therapy. Like chronic migraine, the combined use of these interventions is often best. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tension-type-headache-in-adults-preventive-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tension-type headache in adults: Preventive treatment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tension-type-headache-in-children#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tension-type headache in children&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For medication overuse headache, basic steps are patient education, withdrawal of the overused medication, bridge therapy aimed at headache relief during medication withdrawal, establishment of a headache treatment program appropriate for the underlying type of headache, and relapse prevention. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medication-overuse-headache-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medication overuse headache: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">CLUSTER HEADACHE TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people who suffer with cluster headaches will need both acute and preventive medicines. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cluster-headache-treatment-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cluster headache: Treatment and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute therapy often includes one or more of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inhaling 100 percent oxygen through a face mask for 20 minutes. Oxygen treatment is often recommended first because it has few side effects.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Triptans are medicines often used to treat migraines. Triptans (especially injections of sumatriptan) can stop a cluster headache, often within 20 to 30 minutes. If you are unable to give yourself an injection, options include inhaled (nasal spray) sumatriptan or zolmitriptan.</p><p/><p>If neither oxygen nor triptans are helpful, alternative choices include intranasal lidocaine (liquid applied inside the nose) and ergotamine (a tablet dissolved under the tongue).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Preventive treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preventive therapy is usually started as soon as possible and taken every day when a new cluster of headaches develops. Some people require a combination of medicines. Preventive medicines may be gradually stopped after the cluster has passed, but can be restarted if symptoms recur. The best studied medicines include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Verapamil, a calcium channel blocker, is a pill that is effective and has few side effects. The dose may be slowly increased as needed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The glucocorticoid drug prednisone (a pill) is an effective preventive therapy. However, long-term use of glucocorticoids is not recommended due to the risk of side effects.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLEMENTARY HEADACHE TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several therapies can be used along with medical treatment in people with headache.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Lifestyle changes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some simple lifestyle adjustments can help to reduce the frequency of headaches. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stop smoking</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduce the amount of alcohol you drink</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decrease or stop <span class=\"nowrap\">drinking/eating</span> caffeine</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eat and sleep on a regular schedule</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercise several times per week</p><p/><p>While there are no clinical trials proving the benefit of these measures, many headache specialists have found them helpful for their patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some people with frequent headaches benefit from working with a physical therapist who has a special interest in headaches. This treatment may be used if you do not respond or only partially or temporarily respond to medicines, or if you cannot use medicines (eg, women who are pregnant or breastfeeding). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=headache-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Headache in pregnant and postpartum women&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Acupuncture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acupuncture involves inserting hair-thin, metal needles into the skin at specific points on the body. It causes little to no pain. Electrical stimulation is sometimes applied to the acupuncture needle. Acupuncture has not been proven to improve tension-type or chronic daily headaches. However, people who do not want to try or who cannot tolerate other treatments may try using acupuncture. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tension-type-headache-in-adults-preventive-treatment#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tension-type headache in adults: Preventive treatment&quot;, section on 'Acupuncture'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preventive-treatment-of-migraine-in-adults#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preventive treatment of migraine in adults&quot;, section on 'Acupuncture'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Behavioral therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Headaches can be triggered or worsened by stress, anxiety, depression, and other psychological factors. Furthermore, living with headache pain can cause difficulties in relationships, at work or school, and with general day to day living.</p><p>Behavioral therapy works by helping you to address the stress, anger, or frustration that can come with frequent or chronic headache pain. There are many different types of behavioral therapy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psychotherapy involves meeting with a psychologist, psychiatrist, or social worker to discuss emotional responses to living with chronic pain, treatment successes or failures, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> personal relationships.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Group psychotherapy allows you to compare your experiences with headaches, overcome the tendency to withdraw and become isolated in your pain, and support others' attempts with pain management.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relaxation techniques can relieve muscle tension, and may include meditation, progressive muscle relaxation, self-hypnosis, and biofeedback. Biofeedback may be especially helpful for people with chronic tension-type headaches.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Group skill-building exercises help you to learn about living with pain, including ways to improve relationships and build strength, ways to avoid negative thinking, and learning to deal with pain flares.
