However, the staging evaluations used for cancer patients both at the time of initial diagnosis and for follow-up after the initial treatment are often excessive. There are few, if any, established guidelines that define the appropriate tests for the initial evaluation and subsequent follow-up in patients with melanoma.</p><p>Practical stage-specific guidelines for the evaluation and follow-up of patients with melanoma are presented here. The melanoma staging system and a review of imaging studies useful in the evaluation of melanoma are presented separately.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-treatment-of-regional-lymph-nodes-in-melanoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and treatment of regional lymph nodes in melanoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest x-ray &ndash; The detection rate of occult metastases with chest x-ray is minimal at the time of diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-work-up-and-surveillance-after-treatment-of-melanoma/abstract/1-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-6</a>]. In a series of 876 asymptomatic patients with localized melanoma, only one patient (0.1 percent) had a true-positive chest film demonstrating pulmonary metastases, while false positive tests occurred in approximately 15 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-work-up-and-surveillance-after-treatment-of-melanoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Nonetheless, chest x-rays sometimes show nonspecific abnormalities that can serve as a baseline for future examinations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Computed tomography (CT) studies &ndash; CT has very limited value for detecting unsuspected visceral metastases in asymptomatic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-work-up-and-surveillance-after-treatment-of-melanoma/abstract/3,5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5-7</a>]. As an example, 151 patients in one series were staged with CT of the chest and abdomen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-work-up-and-surveillance-after-treatment-of-melanoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Patients with primary tumors of the head or neck also had a CT of the neck, while those with primary tumors below the waist had a pelvic CT. A total of 29 patients (19 percent) had suspicious scans: in 24 of these, the abnormalities were benign processes (false positives); in three (2 percent), second primary tumors were found (non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, and renal cell carcinoma). Only two patients (1.3 percent) had melanoma metastases. Routine evaluation with brain CT in many other series has not revealed a single case of metastasis in hundreds of patients studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-work-up-and-surveillance-after-treatment-of-melanoma/abstract/3,5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5-7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Positron emission tomography (PET) and <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> scan &ndash; PET and <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> also has not been useful in the staging work-up of asymptomatic patients with stage I and II disease. This is due to both its low sensitivity for occult regional lymphatic disease or unsuspected distant metastases and the low incidence of more advanced disease in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-work-up-and-surveillance-after-treatment-of-melanoma/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. In addition, there is a relatively high rate of false positive examinations. In a retrospective series that specifically addressed the role of <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> scan in 56 patients with T4 primaries (asymptomatic and clinically N0), distant metastases were identified in 4 (7 percent) and regional metastases in 12 (21.4 percent) patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-work-up-and-surveillance-after-treatment-of-melanoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In about 1 percent of patients, PET may detect an incidental second primary tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-work-up-and-surveillance-after-treatment-of-melanoma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Thus <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> scanning appears to add little information beyond what can be obtained with sentinel lymph node biopsy.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2817837\"><span class=\"h1\">STAGE III DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with stage III disease include those with clinical stage I or II disease, in whom occult lymph node disease is diagnosed at sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy, those with clinical stage III disease, based upon the presence of clinically palpable nodes, or lymph nodes detected by imaging (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F50225%7EONC%2F74203\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50225 graphicRef74203 \">table 1A-B</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110664%7EONC%2F110663\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110664 graphicRef110663 \">table 2A-B</a>). Patients with other forms of lymphatic regional metastases (satellite lesions, in transit metastases) are also classified as stage III.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2817844\"><span class=\"h2\">Positive sentinel lymph node</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The common utilization of SLN biopsy in patients with a clinical stage I or II melanoma identifies a subset of patients with clinically occult, pathologically positive SLNs (stage III) who are at increased risk for the subsequent development of disseminated disease compared with otherwise similar patients whose SLNs are negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-work-up-and-surveillance-after-treatment-of-melanoma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Patients with positive SLNs often undergo comprehensive imaging studies either before completion lymphadenectomy or following surgery when they are being considered for adjuvant immunotherapy or participation in adjuvant therapy trials. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tumor-node-metastasis-tnm-staging-system-and-other-prognostic-factors-in-cutaneous-melanoma#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tumor node metastasis (TNM) staging system and other prognostic factors in cutaneous melanoma&quot;, section on 'Eighth edition AJCC TNM staging'</a>.)</p><p>Despite the frequent use of such studies, routine staging with computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or positron emission tomography <span class=\"nowrap\">(PET)/CT</span> scan does not appear to be useful in this setting.</p><p>The low frequency of detectable metastases found with extensive imaging is illustrated by four single institution series:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a series from MD Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC), 314 patients with a positive SLN were evaluated, of whom 270 underwent CT of the chest and abdomen and either CT or MRI of the head [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-work-up-and-surveillance-after-treatment-of-melanoma/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Occult metastases were confirmed in five patients (1.9 percent), nearly all of whom had significant tumor burden in the sentinel node and ulcerated primary tumors. Routine screening identified second primary tumors in 10 patients (3.7 percent), and the false positive rate was 12 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a report from the University of California at San Francisco, CT of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis detected metastases in one of 185 patients (0.5 percent) with a positive SLN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-work-up-and-surveillance-after-treatment-of-melanoma/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. This patient had an ulcerated primary lesion that was &gt;4 mm thick, as well as extensive involvement in the sentinel lymph node. No brain metastases were identified in 112 patients studied with either MRI or CT.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a series from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), 4 of 107 (3.7 percent) patients with a positive SLN had distant metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-work-up-and-surveillance-after-treatment-of-melanoma/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. All four had thick primary tumors and a significant tumor burden within the SLN. The role of PET was evaluated in this series, with results similar to CT alone. If body CT scans and PET had been restricted to patients with thick primaries, the true positive rate would have been 13 percent; if CT and PET were restricted to patients with both thick primaries and macrometastases in the sentinel node, the true positive rate would have been 16 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a series of 46 patients with a positive SLN that were staged with <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> scan, no patient was found to have distant metastases. However, six (13 percent) had nonconclusive findings, which on follow-up probably represented false positives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-work-up-and-surveillance-after-treatment-of-melanoma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p>Thus, most of the occult distant metastases identified in these series are restricted to patients with either a high-risk (ie, &gt;4 mm thick <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ulcerated) primary tumor or more extensive regional lymph node involvement in the SLNs. It is important to remember that even with a positive sentinel lymph node, the true positive rate is very similar to the false positive rate and, therefore, the clinical utility of the <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> scan is low.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2817889\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical stage III and local recurrence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with clinical locoregional melanoma (including local recurrences, satellite or in-transit disease, or clinically apparent nodal disease at presentation) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F50225\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50225 \">table 1A</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110663\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110663 \">table 2B</a>) have a greater than 50 percent risk of systemic recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-work-up-and-surveillance-after-treatment-of-melanoma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>For these patients, we obtain a complete blood count, serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and a chest x-ray. Although these studies are not useful for staging in this situation, they may serve as a baseline for future reference. Although advanced imaging studies (CT, MRI, <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> scan) have a relatively low yield for detecting distant metastases in asymptomatic patients, metastases are detected more frequently than in those with clinical stage I and stage II disease, suggesting that additional imaging studies are warranted.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CT of the chest and abdomen &ndash; CT imaging of the chest and abdomen (including the pelvis) is commonly performed in patients with locoregional disease. While the yield for detecting distant metastases in asymptomatic patients is low, CT can often identify false-positive abnormalities and thereby function as a baseline for future studies in this high-risk population. The neck is generally imaged for a recurrence in the head and neck region.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The results of body CT scans from three single-institution series in the staging work-up of asymptomatic patients with documented locoregional metastases who have a normal chest x-ray and serum LDH are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F81345\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81345 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-work-up-and-surveillance-after-treatment-of-melanoma/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. The true-positive rate for metastases ranged from 4 to 16 percent, with false-positive findings in 8 to 22 percent of studies. Pelvic CT was useful only in patients with inguinal recurrences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-work-up-and-surveillance-after-treatment-of-melanoma/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Brain metastases were identified in 6 percent of patients in the University of Michigan series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-work-up-and-surveillance-after-treatment-of-melanoma/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], but were not observed in either of the other studies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F70510\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70510 \">table 4</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> and PET &ndash; <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> is being widely used at many centers, and <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> has largely replaced the use of PET alone. The role of <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> in clinical stage III melanoma continues to evolve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-work-up-and-surveillance-after-treatment-of-melanoma/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. However, issues remain regarding the optimal technique (use of oral or intravenous contrast, respiratory gating). Like CT or PET alone, the interpretation of <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> is complicated by false-negatives, false-positives, and the identification of second primaries. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imaging-studies-in-melanoma#H1956366\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Imaging studies in melanoma&quot;, section on 'PET and PET/CT'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The potential role of PET and <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> was illustrated by a prospective series of 251 patients with clinically palpable, histologically proven lymph node involvement who were evaluated with PET and CT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-work-up-and-surveillance-after-treatment-of-melanoma/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In this series, PET and CT suggested the presence of distant metastases in 32 and 29 percent of cases, respectively. Based upon the results of imaging and subsequent verification testing, treatment was changed in 19 percent of patients. Of these, the change was due to the results of both scans in 79 percent, due exclusively to PET in 17 percent, and due exclusively to CT in 4 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other studies &ndash; Other imaging studies, such as bone scans, have not had any clinical value in asymptomatic patients with clinical stage III disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-work-up-and-surveillance-after-treatment-of-melanoma/abstract/4,5,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5,25,26</a>].</p><p/><p>Patients who develop a second locoregional recurrence represent a higher risk subset and should undergo staging evaluations as if they had distant metastases, since the results will impact the advisability of attempting further surgical control of locoregional recurrence. (See <a href=\"#H2817953\" class=\"local\">'Stage IV'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2817953\"><span class=\"h1\">STAGE IV</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with known systemic metastases (stage IV) should be evaluated more comprehensively because the likelihood of detecting additional, unsuspected lesions is higher.</p><p>Our approach is to stage these patients with a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and computed tomography (CT) of the chest, abdomen, and usually the pelvis. Some clinicians routinely include CT of the pelvis, while others include this study for patients with a lower extremity or truncal melanoma that drained to the groin or regional disease in the groin or if there are symptoms suggesting metastatic involvement. Other imaging studies should be ordered on the basis of symptoms (eg, MRI of the symptomatic region for patients with bone pain, small bowel follow-through or positron emission tomography <span class=\"nowrap\">[PET]/CT</span> for patients with iron-deficiency anemia or bowel symptoms). Serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) should be obtained in all patients as it has prognostic significance for patients with stage IV disease and could be used as a biomarker for response to treatment (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F74203\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74203 \">table 1B</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110664\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110664 \">table 2A</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tumor-node-metastasis-tnm-staging-system-and-other-prognostic-factors-in-cutaneous-melanoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tumor node metastasis (TNM) staging system and other prognostic factors in cutaneous melanoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Many series report a greater sensitivity with PET scans compared to conventional radiographic studies for the detection of metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-work-up-and-surveillance-after-treatment-of-melanoma/abstract/27-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-30</a>]. In a series of 100 patients with stage IV disease from the Melanoma Institute of Australia, 415 metastatic lesions were evaluated with PET and routine CT scans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-work-up-and-surveillance-after-treatment-of-melanoma/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. PET scan detected 93 percent of lesions. In 20 patients, PET detected 24 metastases up to six months earlier than conventional imaging or physical examination. Furthermore, the selection of surgical and medical treatment was influenced by PET findings in 22 cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-work-up-and-surveillance-after-treatment-of-melanoma/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. PET without concurrent CT may complement routine imaging studies rather than replace them. In a series of 68 patients, PET detected fewer pulmonary, hepatic, and brain metastases but more lymph node and bone metastases than conventional CT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-work-up-and-surveillance-after-treatment-of-melanoma/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p><span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> appears to be more sensitive than either PET or CT alone and is currently the gold standard. In a retrospective study with 250 patients, <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> scan detected significantly more visceral and nonvisceral metastases than either PET alone or CT alone (98.7 with <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> versus 88.8 and 69.7 percent, with PET alone and CT alone, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-work-up-and-surveillance-after-treatment-of-melanoma/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> was also more accurate than CT for staging regional nodes (N). Therefore, we generally complement conventional CT and MRI with integrated <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> in the staging work-up of patients who have solitary or oligometastatic disease, where the issue of surgical resection is most relevant.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2818027\"><span class=\"h1\">SURVEILLANCE AFTER TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary objective of follow-up in patients with melanoma is to identify potentially curable locoregional recurrences, second primary melanomas, and possibly early distant recurrences. Patients with a low tumor burden appear to be more responsive to systemic therapy, particularly immunotherapy. The incidence of a second melanoma is increased in melanoma survivors, with the cumulative risk ranging from 2 to 5 percent at periods from 5 to 20 years after initial diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-work-up-and-surveillance-after-treatment-of-melanoma/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>]. For patients with melanoma in situ, no specific oncologic follow-up is indicated, but patients require continued dermatologic follow-up because of the risk of a second primary, particularly if atypical nevi are present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-the-development-of-melanoma#H55103422\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for the development of melanoma&quot;, section on 'Personal history of melanoma'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-and-early-detection-of-melanoma-in-adults-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening and early detection of melanoma in adults and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Prior to the widespread use of sentinel lymph node (SLN) biopsy in patients with stage I or II melanomas, most initial recurrences were locoregional. However, locoregional recurrences are less common in patients who have histologically negative SLN biopsy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F50225%7EONC%2F74203\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50225 graphicRef74203 \">table 1A-B</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110664%7EONC%2F110663\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110664 graphicRef110663 \">table 2A-B</a>).</p><p>In patients who initially present with stage III disease, systemic recurrences are more common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-work-up-and-surveillance-after-treatment-of-melanoma/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Although distant recurrences are often fatal, the potential for long-term benefit from treatment of systemic disease, particularly for those with low tumor burden, has markedly improved with the development of novel immunotherapies such as checkpoint inhibitors. Thus, although historically the most important elements in the follow-up of patients with melanoma were the medical history and the physical examination, we believe that the improvement in systemic therapies will likely lead to an enhanced role of imaging in the future.</p><p>Optimal follow-up strategy and intervals have not been determined, and there is no consensus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-work-up-and-surveillance-after-treatment-of-melanoma/abstract/34,36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,36,37</a>]. At a minimum, patients should undergo an annual routine physical examination, including a full skin assessment and palpation of the regional lymph nodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-work-up-and-surveillance-after-treatment-of-melanoma/abstract/36,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,38</a>]. More frequent visits are appropriate for patients at high risk for multiple primary lesions (ie, patients with multiple clinically atypical moles, a family history of melanoma, or excessive sun exposure), or for more extensive (ie, stage II or III) disease.</p><p>Most series that examined the value of imaging studies for routine follow-up were retrospective and showed that the majority of recurrences (80 to 90 percent) were discovered by history and physical examination and not by imaging or laboratory studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-work-up-and-surveillance-after-treatment-of-melanoma/abstract/7,39-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,39-42</a>]. Periodic chest x-rays were often obtained for early detection of pulmonary metastases. Chest x-rays and other radiographic studies detected recurrences in less than 10 percent of cases of early stage disease, but a higher percent of those with resected node-positive disease (28 percent in one German study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-work-up-and-surveillance-after-treatment-of-melanoma/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]). Routine blood work including complete blood count (CBC), liver function tests, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), were rarely the sole indicator of recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-work-up-and-surveillance-after-treatment-of-melanoma/abstract/7,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,40</a>].</p><p>The Melanoma Institute of Australia has reported the results of a prospective study, which assessed the value of follow-up surveillance studies in 211 patients who had relapsed after initial treatment for a stage I, II, or III melanoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-work-up-and-surveillance-after-treatment-of-melanoma/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. The first melanoma recurrence was local in 13 percent, in-transit in 17 percent, in regional nodes in 46 percent, and distant in 24 percent of the patients. Seventy-three percent of all recurrences were detected by the patient. The presence of a symptom was the only independent predictor of a patient-detected recurrence. There was no statistically significant difference in survival depending upon whether the recurrence was detected by the patient or the doctor. The authors of the study concluded that better patient education may improve the rate of detection and that more frequent follow-up visits are unlikely to be valuable.</p><p>In a subsequent study from the same group, 108 patients with positive sentinel lymph node biopsies were followed with surveillance chest x-rays every six months for five years and then annually for an additional five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-work-up-and-surveillance-after-treatment-of-melanoma/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Lung metastases were eventually detected in 23 cases (21 percent), but the surveillance chest x-rays detected only 11 of these, only 3 of whom were candidates for metastasectomy. In addition, false positive findings were identified in the lung in 19 cases. The authors concluded that serial surveillance chest x-ray were unlikely to be beneficial.</p><p>Despite the lack of data that the routine use of imaging studies is beneficial in the follow-up of patients with melanoma, these studies were conducted in an era in which systemic therapies had very little if any impact on overall survival. Because of that, the current guidelines from various medical societies vary markedly. For instance, the Australian and New Zealand Guidelines recommend only history and physical examination with imaging studies prompted by clinical complaints while the Swiss Guidelines recommend positron emission tomography <span class=\"nowrap\">(PET)/computed</span> tomography (CT) scan every 6 to 12 months for stages IIC and III patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-work-up-and-surveillance-after-treatment-of-melanoma/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>A comparison of survival outcomes for patients with stage IV melanoma at leading Australian and United States institutions showed a six-month survival advantage from the date of stage IV diagnosis for patients diagnosed and treated in United States centers. A thorough analysis showed that this benefit appeared to be largely related to a six-month lead time in the detection of stage IV melanoma. This was largely attributable to more aggressive follow-up in United States institutions including more frequent visits and regular imaging with chest x-ray at one site and CT scans at another site. While this earlier detection may have been of little consequence in the era prior to approval of effective systemic treatment options, this may not be the case in the current era where multiple treatment options exist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-work-up-and-surveillance-after-treatment-of-melanoma/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>In conclusion, historically the major value of the follow-up visits was to detect potentially surgically curable recurrences, particularly locoregional. With the advent of more effective systemic therapies, this paradigm is clearly evolving. At a minimum, we recommend a detailed medical history and physical examination with special attention to regional recurrences every 3 to 12 months, depending on the risk of recurrence. We favor the use of <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> every six months in very high-risk melanoma patients, such as those with clinical stage III and IV (rendered disease-free by surgery). Patients, however, should be informed that the imaging studies and blood work is yet to be of proven value in terms of its impact on overall survival. In light of the new and more effective systemic therapies, additional studies are needed to better define the role of imaging in the follow-up of patients with melanoma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

More extensive imaging may be appropriate, generally following completion lymph node dissection, if adjuvant immunotherapy or participation in a clinical trial is being considered.

For this group, we suggest more comprehensive imaging (ie, body CT with or without magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] of the brain) prior to the completion lymphadenectomy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2817844\" class=\"local\">'Positive sentinel lymph node'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Positive findings on imaging studies should be interpreted cautiously because of the high false positive rate.

Although the yield of these tests is low, they often identify false-positive abnormalities and thereby function as an important baseline for future studies in this high-risk population. The neck is generally imaged for primary lesions in the head and neck region.
