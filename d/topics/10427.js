The diagnostic evaluation to acute severe hypertension is discussed separately.

The clinician should understand that there is a spectrum of severity of acute hypertension. Any classification scheme that divides the clinical presentation of acute severe hypertension into separate categories is by its nature arbitrary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypertensive-emergencies-and-urgencies-in-children/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Clinical judgment must be used to gauge the severity of acute hypertension and guide management.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypertension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypertension in children is defined as either systolic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diastolic blood pressure (BP) &ge;95<sup>th</sup> percentile measured upon three or more occasions. As in adults, hypertension in children is further divided into two stages (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F114574\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114574 \">table 1</a>). The definition and diagnosis of hypertension in children is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-and-diagnosis-of-hypertension-in-children-and-adolescents#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition and diagnosis of hypertension in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Definition'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Severity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The decision process for evaluation and treatment varies with the severity of the hypertension. Stage 2 identifies those children who need more prompt evaluation and immediate pharmacologic treatment, while stage 1 hypertension allows for more time for evaluation and initial treatment with nonpharmacologic therapy unless the patient is symptomatic or has hypertensive target-organ damage. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonemergent-treatment-of-hypertension-in-children-and-adolescents#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonemergent treatment of hypertension in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Nonpharmacologic therapy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonemergent-treatment-of-hypertension-in-children-and-adolescents#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonemergent treatment of hypertension in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Pharmacologic therapy'</a>.) </p><p>While there is no specific numerical value or BP percentile that identifies &ldquo;acute severe hypertension&rdquo; in youth, in one relatively large case series of pediatric patients with acute severe hypertension, most patients had BP readings well in excess of stage 2 hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypertensive-emergencies-and-urgencies-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The newest guidance from the AAP suggests that clinicians be concerned about hypertensive complications in patients with BP values &gt;30 mmHg above the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F62371%7EEM%2F75178\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62371 graphicRef75178 \">figure 1A-B</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63856\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63856 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52646\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52646 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypertensive-emergencies-and-urgencies-in-children/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypertensive emergency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An acute severe symptomatic elevation in BP <strong>WITH</strong> evidence of potentially life-threatening symptoms or target organ damage defines a hypertensive emergency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypertensive-emergencies-and-urgencies-in-children/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. Blood pressures (BPs) are commonly elevated far above the level of stage 2 hypertension.</p><p>The most commonly involved organs are the brain, kidneys, eyes, and heart. Careful intervention to lower blood pressure should begin emergently upon recognition of a hypertensive emergency and should be accomplished with intravenous antihypertensive agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypertensive-emergencies-and-urgencies-in-children/abstract/1,2,6-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,6-11</a>].

Cardiopulmonary manifestations (congestive heart failure, pulmonary edema) may also be seen. Acute kidney injury can also be a manifestation of hypertensive emergency. </p><p>The absolute level of BP elevation is less important than whether symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> target end organ damage is present. For example, a child with chronic hypertension may have impressively high BP measurements without symptoms. Another child with an acute rise in BP may manifest a hypertensive emergency despite a BP that seems to be only moderately elevated. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Hypertensive urgency'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypertensive urgency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An acute severe elevation in BP <strong>WITHOUT</strong> severe, life-threatening symptoms or evidence of acute target organ damage describes a hypertensive urgency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypertensive-emergencies-and-urgencies-in-children/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. The duration of hypertension (acute or chronic) is an important determinant of intervention.

Knowledge of the most prevalent etiologies by age group also helps guide treatment decisions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73225\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73225 \">table 5</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-hypertensive-emergencies-and-urgencies-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to hypertensive emergencies and urgencies in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Specific pediatric hypertensive emergencies'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Confirmation of severe hypertension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As with less severe hypertension, once an elevated BP is discovered, the measurement should be confirmed, preferably using auscultation with careful attention to cuff size and placement. A BP cuff that is too small will artificially elevate the BP reading (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F73414\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73414 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F58304\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58304 \">table 6</a>).

Oscillometric devices are actually well-suited for measuring BP repeatedly at short intervals and can therefore be relied upon until an invasive method of measuring BP can be established.</p><p>Specific causes of hypertension that may require other management approaches should be identified before antihypertensive treatment is started. These etiologies would include aortic coarctation, head trauma, intracranial mass lesion, sympathomimetic drug overdose, and severe pain.

Despite the lack of evidence, many antihypertensive agents have found widespread use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypertensive-emergencies-and-urgencies-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Treatment recommendations are based upon limited pediatric evidence from small observational studies and have been largely extrapolated from randomized controlled trials in adults. The choice of medication should be dictated by the suspected underlying cause of the hypertensive emergency. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Specific pediatric hypertensive emergencies'</a> below.)</p><p>Studies in adults suggest that intravenous medications are superior to oral medications for hypertensive emergencies and that a controlled decrease in blood pressure (BP) typically avoids permanent hypertension-induced organ damage AND ischemic end organ damage related to overly rapid lowering of BP. An experienced clinician, such as a pediatric nephrologist or intensivist, should guide therapy of pediatric hypertensive emergencies whenever possible once emergency care is accomplished. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=moderate-to-severe-hypertensive-retinopathy-and-hypertensive-encephalopathy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Moderate to severe hypertensive retinopathy and hypertensive encephalopathy in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There is an urgent need for better information on pharmacologic management of pediatric acute severe hypertension. Despite recent legislative initiatives, many commonly used antihypertensive medications lack evidence-based dosing recommendations. For many drugs where dosing recommendations are available, they are based upon small case series or expert opinion, and were generated prior to passage of the Food and Drug Modernization Act [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypertensive-emergencies-and-urgencies-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. This is particularly true for some of the more commonly used intravenously administered antihypertensive medications, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydralazine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">hydralazine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=labetalol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">labetalol</a>. The lack of dosing recommendations based upon properly conducted pediatric clinical trials clearly hinders provision of safe, effective care to this vulnerable patient population.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Hypertensive emergency goal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evidence is lacking regarding the optimal degree and pace for reduction of blood pressure in children with hypertensive emergencies. Based upon expert opinion, we suggest that children with acute severe hypertension and life-threatening symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> target-organ involvement should emergently receive intravenous medication that lowers systolic blood pressure (BP) in a controlled fashion by no more than 25 percent of the overall planned BP reduction over the first eight hours of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypertensive-emergencies-and-urgencies-in-children/abstract/2,4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,5</a>]. The ultimate goal for treatment is achievement of a BP value that will cause cessation of life-threatening signs and symptoms and prevent further hypertensive target organ effects. Generally speaking, this is typically a BP at the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile for age, sex, and height (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63856\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63856 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52646\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52646 \">table 3</a>), but the goal should be individualized for each patient as determined by response to treatment. </p><p>In the author's experience, this goal can be accomplished by first administering one to two intravenous boluses of an antihypertensive medication (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=labetalol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">labetalol</a> 0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per dose, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydralazine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">hydralazine</a> 0.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per dose) followed by the initiation of a continuous infusion of labetalol or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nicardipine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">nicardipine</a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F65359\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef65359 \">algorithm 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F80380\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80380 \">table 8</a>). The infusion rate should be titrated to achieve the desired BP reduction while avoiding additional symptomatic BP increases.</p><p>Overly rapid lowering of BP by more than 25 percent of the planned BP reduction in the first eight hours of treatment can cause irreversible target organ damage, including permanent neurologic sequelae, visual defects, myocardial infarction, and renal insufficiency due to abnormalities of autoregulation induced by chronic hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypertensive-emergencies-and-urgencies-in-children/abstract/1,8,10,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8,10,14</a>]. </p><p>The amount of time taken for further BP reduction after the initial eight hours of therapy will depend upon the clinical setting and should be guided by an experienced clinician, such as a pediatric nephrologist or intensivist. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'First line intravenous agents'</a> below and <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Other intravenous agents'</a> below and <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Specific pediatric hypertensive emergencies'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Hypertensive urgency goal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A child with a hypertensive urgency warrants an immediate evaluation. When the urgency arises from an acute process with a rapid change in mean arterial pressure (eg, poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis), intervention should occur promptly (within hours), and treatment with intravenous antihypertensive medications is appropriate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F80380\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80380 \">table 8</a>). However, in the setting of a chronic condition (eg, chronic kidney disease), where BP has increased gradually over time, lowering of the BP should occur less quickly (eg, over one to two days or more), and oral medications may be used (eg, oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">clonidine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isradipine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">isradipine</a>) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F57259\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57259 \">table 9</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F65359\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef65359 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Mode of administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest that pediatric hypertensive emergencies be managed with continuous intravenous antihypertensive administration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F80380\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80380 \">table 8</a>).

The ultimate goal for treatment is achievement of a BP value that will cause cessation of life-threatening signs and symptoms and prevent further hypertensive target organ effects. Generally speaking, this is typically a BP at the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile for age, sex, and height (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63856\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63856 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52646\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52646 \">table 3</a>), but the goal should be individualized for each patient as determined by response to treatment.
