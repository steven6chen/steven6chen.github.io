Exposure to caffeine is generally of long duration, and the prevalence of exposure is very high (&gt;80 percent) in most countries. The main sources of caffeine and the amount found in each are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F79304\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79304 \">table 1</a>). Coffee and tea average 100 mg of caffeine per serving, colas about 50 mg per serving, and &ldquo;energy drinks&rdquo; as much as 250 mg per serving.</p><p>The effects of caffeine on the cardiovascular system are the subject of this review. Non-cardiovascular effects of caffeine are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benefits-and-risks-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benefits and risks of caffeine and caffeinated beverages&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13216188\"><span class=\"h1\">ACTIVE INGREDIENTS IN COFFEE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This topic focuses on the cardiovascular effects of caffeine. Most of the relevant studies of chronic caffeine ingestion have been performed in coffee drinkers. While coffee contains other compounds such as chlorogenic acid, potassium, magnesium, niacin, and lignans, we are not aware of evidence to suggest that these compounds influence cardiovascular outcomes in the amounts consumed by coffee drinkers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=benefits-and-risks-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Benefits and risks of caffeine and caffeinated beverages&quot;, section on 'Active components and metabolism'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PHARMACOKINETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Caffeine is absorbed after oral, rectal, or parenteral administration, and maximal concentration is achieved in one hour [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Oral bioavailability is almost 100 percent; food slows the rate of absorption but does not limit the extent. Any effects on the cardiovascular system should return to baseline after about 10 and 60 hours, as the half-life is 2 to 12 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Cardiovascular effects'</a> below.)</p><p>The apparent volume of distribution is between 0.4 and 0.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/kg,</span> and less than 40 percent is bound to plasma proteins. Caffeine is distributed into all body compartments; it crosses the placenta and passes into breast milk.</p><p>Metabolism primarily occurs in the liver by demethylation and oxidation, with less than 5 percent excreted unchanged in the urine. The major metabolic pathway in humans is through the formation of paraxanthine (1,7-dimethylxanthine), leading to the principal urinary metabolites, 1-methylxanthine, 1-methyluric acid, and an acetylated uracil derivative. A minor pathway involves the formation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=theophylline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">theophylline</a> and theobromine, and their subsequent metabolism. In most patients, the drug obeys first-order kinetics; zero-order kinetics occur at higher concentrations because of saturation of metabolic enzymes.</p><p>The average half-life in plasma is five hours (range three to seven hours) but is somewhat shorter in children (three to four hours). The half-life may increase twofold in the last trimester of pregnancy. However, there is marked interindividual variation in the rate of elimination.</p><p>The main determinants of plasma caffeine concentration are the elimination half-life and time since last consumed. Since the half-life is about five hours, and it is usually consumed in separate doses throughout the day, the plasma caffeine concentration is normally highest in the late afternoon and lowest upon awakening in the morning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Overnight abstinence of 8 to 12 hours leads to significant depletion of systemic caffeine by early morning, rendering the subject sensitive to its effects when re-exposure occurs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>There is an association between plasma levels of caffeine and toxicity and the activity of hepatic cytochrome CYP1A2. A study of 120 normal healthy volunteers found that CYP1A2 activity, gender, and smoking influenced the toxicity of caffeine; in particular, females and nonsmokers who experienced toxic effects had a lower caffeine N3-demethylation index (a measure of CYP1A2 activity) compared with females and nonsmokers who did not experience toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The rate of caffeine metabolism may be an important determinant of the effect of coffee intake on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk (see <a href=\"#H13216333\" class=\"local\">'Cardiovascular disease outcomes'</a> below). This was suggested in a study that analyzed outcomes according to alleles of CYP1A2: Individuals homozygous for the CYP1A2*1A allele were rapid metabolizers of caffeine, while carriers of the CYP1A2*1F allele (55 percent of the study population) were slow metabolizers of caffeine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Among rapid metabolizers, there was no association between coffee intake and nonfatal myocardial infarction. By contrast, slow metabolizers had a dose-dependent increase in risk (multivariate adjusted odds ratio [OR] 0.99, 1.36, and 1.64 for consumption of one, two to three, and four or more cups of coffee per day, respectively). These observations suggest that caffeine plays a role in the coronary risk associated with coffee intake.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CARDIOVASCULAR EFFECTS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H746836\"><span class=\"h2\">Physiologic effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Caffeine is a methylated xanthine derivative (1,3,7- trimethylxanthine) and is widely distributed in nature as a plant alkaloid. It affects cardiovascular hemodynamics as well as electrophysiologic properties of the heart. A number of molecular mechanisms have been detected in vitro for methylxanthines, but only some that take place at reasonably low concentrations are involved in the responses observed in vivo. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inhibition of phosphodiesterase, which results in an elevation in myocardial cyclic adenosine monophosphate and a positive inotropic action on the myocardium.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inhibition of adenosine receptors, possibly preventing the negative inotropic effect elicited by adenosine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Facilitation of norepinephrine release from sympathetic nerve endings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increase in intracellular calcium, mediated at high doses of caffeine by inhibition of calcium reuptake into the sarcoplasmic reticulum and at low doses by calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increase in sensitivity of the myofilaments to calcium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p/><p>Caffeine can directly increase the transmembrane calcium current that is responsible for the oscillatory afterpotential (ie, triggered activity) in in vitro and in vivo experimental models, in part via release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/10,12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,12-15</a>].</p><p>The acute caffeine-induced pressor effect described below (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Blood pressure'</a> below) is probably related to vasoconstriction due to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An increase in sympathetic activity and circulating catecholamine concentrations mediated by central nervous system stimulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. However, the above observation that, in habitual drinkers, muscle sympathetic nerve activity is increased in the absence of a pressor response suggests that increased sympathetic activity alone is not sufficient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antagonism of endogenous adenosine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

Nevertheless, there are patients who may be more sensitive to caffeine and note a relationship of palpitations to caffeine intake. In addition, there are case reports of arrhythmia in patients with underlying cardiac disease who have ingested excessive amounts of caffeine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/26-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-30</a>]. Thus, patients susceptible to cardiac arrhythmias should avoid consuming large quantities of caffeine, although modest amounts appear to be safe.</p><p>Based on data from large cohort and case-control studies, regular caffeine consumption does not appear to correlate with an increased arrhythmia risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/22,24,25,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,24,25,31,32</a>]. In a meta-analysis of seven observational studies with &gt;100,000 individuals, caffeine exposure was not associated with an increased risk of atrial fibrillation (odds ratio [OR] 0.92; 95% CI 0.82-1.04) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In an observational study of 130,054 patients enrolled in the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program, those who reported modest coffee intake (ie, one to three cups per day) did not have an increased likelihood of hospitalization for arrhythmia compared with coffee abstainers (hazard ratio [HR] 0.93; 95% CI 0.84-1.02), and those who reported heavier coffee intake (ie, &ge;4 cups per day) had a lower risk of hospitalization for arrhythmia compared with coffee abstainers (HR 0.82; 95% CI 0.73-0.93) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>In the prospective Cardiovascular Health Study, 1416 participants aged &ge;65 years completed a dietary assessment (including frequency of consumption of caffeinated products) and underwent 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiography (Holter) monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. There were no differences in the number of supraventricular or ventricular premature beats across different levels of caffeine intake. After adjustment for potential confounders, more frequent consumption of caffeinated products was not associated with ectopy.</p><p>Two small randomized trials have evaluated the effect of caffeine on risk of arrhythmia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. In one trial involving 13 patients with frequent symptomatic idiopathic ventricular premature beats, caffeine restriction did not reduce patient-reported palpitations or frequency of ventricular premature beats on 24-hour electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In another trial of 51 patients with moderate to severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction randomized to caffeine (500 mg) or placebo, the frequency of ventricular and supraventricular premature beats, couplets, bigeminy, and nonsustained tachycardia was similar in both groups over about seven hours of continuous monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Exercise test-derived variables (eg, ventricular and supraventricular premature beats, duration of exercise, estimated peak oxygen consumption, and heart rate) were also similar.</p><p>In addition, caffeine does not appear to enhance the ability to induce an arrhythmia in the electrophysiology (EP) laboratory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/19,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,35</a>]. In one study, 80 patients with symptomatic supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) undergoing EP study prior to catheter ablation were randomized to caffeine (5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span> or placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. There was no difference between groups in SVT inducibility or the cycle length of induced tachycardias. In another prospective study, 22 patients with a history of SVT or fibrillation underwent EP testing before and one hour after coffee ingestion (275 mg of caffeine) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The ability to induce an arrhythmia was unchanged in 10 patients, increased in six, and reduced in six; and rhythm severity was unchanged in 17 patients, more severe in two, and less severe in three.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood pressure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Caffeine can acutely raise the blood pressure (BP) by as much as 10 mmHg in individuals who are infrequently exposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/16,36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,36-38</a>], but there is little or no acute effect on BP in habitual coffee drinkers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/16,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,38</a>].</p><p>With regard to its impact in non-habitual coffee drinkers, caffeine can potentiate (by about 5 to 10 mmHg) a rise in BP induced by stress, such as that occurring in the workplace [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. The acute elevation BP caused by caffeine is more pronounced in hypertensive patients; compared with subjects with optimal blood pressure, those with hypertension had a &gt;1.5-fold greater increase in blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The hypertensive effect may be more prominent in older adult patients with hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>The effects of chronic caffeine ingestion on BP are less clear, but the possibility of a slight increase in BP exists. One systematic review and meta-analysis of 10 randomized controlled trials and five cohort studies found no effect of chronic coffee consumption on BP and the risk of development of hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. However, two other meta-analyses found that coffee ingestion increased BP slightly. In the first of these two, systolic and diastolic BP increased by 1.2 and 0.49 mmHg, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. In a meta-analysis of six prospective cohort studies with a mean follow-up of more than six years, the pooled relative risks [RR] for hypertension were 1.09 (95% CI 1.01-1.18), 1.07 (95% CI 0.96-1.20), and 1.08 (95% CI 0.96-1.21) comparing one to three, three to five, and more than five cups to less than one cup of coffee per day, respectively. Consistent with this observation is that similar reductions in BP may be seen when habitual coffee drinkers either abstain from coffee or switch to decaffeinated coffee [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/44-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-46</a>].</p><p>The effect of coffee on BP may not be solely explained by caffeine. In a study of 15 volunteers (six habitual and nine non-habitual coffee drinkers), intravenous caffeine increased sympathetic nerve activity in muscle and BP to a similar degree in both groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Caffeinated coffee raised the BP only in non-habitual drinkers, despite similar plasma caffeine concentrations and a similar increase in muscle sympathetic nerve activity. Furthermore, non-habitual drinkers had similar elevations in BP and muscle sympathetic nerve activity with caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee. By comparison, ingestion of tea does not appear to have a significant effect upon BP. A meta-analysis of five studies of tea ingestion among 343 subjects reported that BP was unchanged at a median duration of four weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>The likelihood of a pressor response is in part determined by the pharmacokinetics of caffeine in each individual. This was illustrated in a study of normotensive habitual coffee drinkers who ingested coffee after caffeine abstinence of 4.5 individual caffeine half-lives; the ensuing increase in BP was inversely related to the baseline plasma caffeine concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Thus, rapid metabolizers of caffeine are more likely to have a pressor response after drinking coffee, despite the phenomenon of adaptation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H351702091\"><span class=\"h2\">Diuretic effect</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Caffeine and related methylxanthine compounds in higher doses may have a diuretic action. One literature review suggested that acute ingestion of caffeine in doses of at least 250 to 300 mg, equivalent to amounts found in two to three cups of coffee or five to eight cups of tea, results in short-term stimulation of urine output in individuals deprived of caffeine for a period of days or weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. A tolerance to the diuretic effect develops and diureses is diminished in those who regularly consume tea or coffee. Doses of caffeine equivalent to amounts found in standard servings of tea, coffee, and carbonated soft drinks appear to have little diuretic action.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Aortic stiffness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aortic stiffness is an important determinant of the performance of the cardiovascular system and prognosis of cardiovascular risk. Caffeine acutely increases arterial stiffness, and the effect is synergistic with smoking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. The ingestion of 200 mg of caffeine (equivalent to two cups of coffee) increased pulse-wave velocity and augmentation index by 0.33 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/s</span> and 4 percent, respectively, an effect that was augmented when combined with smoking (increased by 0.85 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/s</span> and 17.4 percent, respectively). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=increased-pulse-pressure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Increased pulse pressure&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Lipids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evidence presented below suggests no major impact of filtered coffee consumption on the lipid profile. Thus, we do not recommend discontinuation of coffee consumption to improve the lipid profile. Most studies have shown no adverse effects of filtered coffee intake on plasma lipids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/51-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-55</a>]. In the prospective cohort study cited above of over 132,000 men and women from the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study and the Nurses' Health Study, there was no association between the intake of filtered caffeinated coffee or filtered decaffeinated coffee and serum concentrations of total cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, or high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p>However, there may be a hyperlipidemic effect of non-filtered coffee [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/52,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,56</a>] which contains coffee lipid compounds (such as cafestol) that are removed by a paper filter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. In one study, the daily ingestion of four to six cups of boiled, but not filtered, coffee for a period of nine weeks increased serum total cholesterol by 18.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (0.48 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> and LDL cholesterol by 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (0.39 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L),</span> with no effect on HDL cholesterol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].

The multivariable RR of total stroke across categories of coffee consumption (less than one cup per day, one to two cups per day, three to four cups per day, and at least five cups per day) were 1.00, 0.78 (95% CI 0.66-0.91), 0.75 (95% CI 0.64-0.88), and 0.77 (95% CI 0.63-0.92), respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>These findings for coffee consumption and stroke incidence are consistent with those of the Nurses&rsquo; Health Study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>] and the Alpha-Tocopherol, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=beta-carotene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Beta-Carotene</a> Cancer Prevention study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].

The Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study results suggest that high consumption of coffee and tea may reduce the risk of cerebral infarction among men, independent of known cardiovascular risk factors.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A meta-analysis of 11 prospective studies (n = 479,689) with 10,003 cases of stroke reported that moderate coffee consumption was weakly inversely associated with risk of stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Compared with no coffee consumption, the RR of stroke were 0.86 (95% CI 0.78-0.94) for two cups of coffee per day, 0.83 (95% CI 0.74-0.92) for three to four cups per day, 0.87 (95% CI 0.77-0.97) for six cups per day, and 0.93 (95% CI 0.79-1.08) for eight cups per day.</p><p/><p>One small observational study found that, in patients who drank one or less cups of coffee per day, the risk of stroke was significantly increased in the hour following coffee consumption compared with periods of nonuse (RR 2.0, 95% CI 1.4-2.8) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Mortality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/66-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">66-70</a>], but not all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>], observational studies have found an inverse relationship between coffee consumption and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality.

The relationship between coffee consumption and all-cause mortality is discussed separately.

During more than five million person-years of follow-up, there were 33,731 and 18,784 deaths in men and women. After adjustment for tobacco-smoking status and other potential confounders, there was a significant inverse association between coffee consumption and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Adjusted hazard ratios for death due to heart disease among men who drank coffee, as compared with those who did not, were as follows: 0.93 (95% CI 0.85-1.02) for drinking less than one cup per day; 0.92 (95% CI 0.84-1.01) for one cup; 0.86 (95% CI 0.79-0.94) for two or three cups; 0.87 (95% CI 0.79-0.96) for four or five cups; and 0.88 (95% CI 0.78-1.00) for six or more cups of coffee per day (p&lt;0.03 for trend). The respective hazard ratios [HR] among women were 1.00 (95% CI 0.89-1.13), 0.91 (95% CI 0.81-1.03), 0.85 (95% CI 0.76-0.95), 0.78 (95% CI 0.68-0.90), and 0.72 (95% CI 0.59-0.88) (p&lt;0.001 for trend).</p><p>However, in the Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study, which included 43,727 participants followed for an average of 17 years, convincing evidence for either a positive or a negative relationship was not found. With regard to cardiovascular mortality in men and women, the adjusted HRs for consumption averaging more than four cups of caffeinated coffee per day were not statistically significant (HR 1.15, 95% CI 0.89-1.49 and HR 0.73, CI 0.23-2.27, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H78131581\"><span class=\"h2\">Sudden cardiac arrest</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The effect of caffeine on the risk of sudden cardiac arrest has not been well studied. A case-control study of 117 patients with an out-of-hospital sudden cardiac arrest (all with a prior clinical history of coronary heart disease) and a group of unselected age- and gender-matched coronary heart disease control patients found that the consumption of more than 10 cups of coffee per day was a risk factor for sudden cardiac arrest after adjustment for accepted risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-effects-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Consumed in coffee, tea, soft drinks, and small amounts in chocolate, caffeine is the most widely used pharmacologically active substance in the world. The main sources of caffeine and the amount found in each is summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F79304\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79304 \">table 1</a>).

However, it is possible that there is a slight increase in blood pressure with chronic coffee use.

However, patients with underlying cardiac disease should be counseled to avoid ingesting &ldquo;energy drinks&rdquo; and other beverages with excessive amounts of caffeine. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Arrhythmias'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Concerns regarding possible deleterious cardiovascular effects of caffeine when used in small or moderate amounts (eg, &le;six cups of coffee per day) on cardiovascular outcomes such as death or stroke are not supported by the literature. There is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about the cardiovascular effects of consuming more than this amount of coffee per day. (See <a href=\"#H13216333\" class=\"local\">'Cardiovascular disease outcomes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We do not recommend discontinuing caffeine intake for the purpose of improving cardiovascular outcomes. However, it is reasonable to attempt a trial of caffeine cessation in patients who are bothered by palpitations.
