Minor depression frequently occurs in patients with comorbid anxiety, substance use, personality, and general medical disorders. (See <a href=\"#H26204824\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although many episodes of minor depression eventually resolve, the disorder can persist or recur and can also progress to major depression. In addition, minor depression is associated with an increased risk of developing other psychiatric disorders (eg, anxiety disorders), and with increased all-cause mortality. (See <a href=\"#H796041999\" class=\"local\">'Course of illness'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial assessment for minor depression includes a psychiatric history and mental status examination, as well as a general medical history, physical examination, and focused laboratory tests. The psychiatric history should emphasize symptoms of depression, suicidal ideation and behavior, chronological history of depressive symptoms and disorders, other psychiatric disorders, medications, prior history of mood and anxiety disorders, psychosocial stressors, level of social support, and family history of mood and anxiety disorders. The Patient Health Questionnaire &ndash; Nine Item (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F59307\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59307 \">table 1</a>) can be used to screen for minor depression. (See <a href=\"#H26204572\" class=\"local\">'Assessment'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnostic criteria for minor depression include two to four depressive symptoms (dysphoria, anhedonia, appetite or weight change, sleep disturbance, psychomotor agitation or retardation, anergia, thoughts of worthlessness or inappropriate guilt, impaired cognition, and recurrent thoughts of death or suicide or suicide attempt), at least one of which is dysphoria or anhedonia. In addition, symptoms cause significant distress or psychosocial impairment. (See <a href=\"#H1839470\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms of minor depression overlap with symptoms of other depressive disorders, including major depression; dysthymia; adjustment disorder with depressed mood; <span class=\"nowrap\">substance/medication</span> induced depressive disorder; and depressive disorder due to another medical condition, including neurologic disorders (eg, Parkinson disease or stroke), endocrine disorders (eg, hypothyroidism), infections (eg, HIV), and autoimmune diseases (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus). (See <a href=\"#H1839404\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H635382351\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We are saddened by the death of Wayne Katon, MD, who passed away in March 2015.
