Two reports from the Netherlands in the late 1980s provide the most clinical information characterizing these syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cellulitis-following-pelvic-lymph-node-dissection/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Subsequent case reports from the United States have confirmed these initial observations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cellulitis-following-pelvic-lymph-node-dissection/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a series of 270 women who had undergone pelvic lymphadenectomy with radical hysterectomy, acute cellulitis developed in 4 percent of women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cellulitis-following-pelvic-lymph-node-dissection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Most patients had either cervical or endometrial carcinoma. Collectively, nine women experienced 17 episodes of cellulitis during over 14,000 patient months of follow-up; the average time to the first episode of cellulitis was 29 months (range 4 to 52 months). Surprisingly, cellulitis developed only in patients who had undergone postoperative pelvic irradiation.</p><p>In a subsequent study of 126 women who had undergone radical vulvectomy with superficial and deep inguinal lymphadenectomy for vulvar carcinoma, acute cellulitis occurred in 26 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cellulitis-following-pelvic-lymph-node-dissection/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Colonization with beta-hemolytic streptococci prior to surgery was the only significant risk factor. The incidence of cellulitis was higher in patients with history of postoperative radiation (33 versus only 16 percent).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Streptococcal sex syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A temporal relationship between vaginal intercourse and the onset of acute cellulitis has been described (&quot;streptococcal sex syndrome&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cellulitis-following-pelvic-lymph-node-dissection/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In one patient who was 22 weeks pregnant and who had undergone a modified radical vulvectomy with inguinal lymphadenectomy for squamous cell carcinoma of the labia majora two months earlier, symptoms of acute infection developed within one hour of coitus. One month later, she again noted the onset of cellulitis promptly after sexual intercourse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presentation of acute cellulitis is similar for most patients regardless of the anatomical location of the primary skin lesion. Most patients note the acute onset of fever, chills, and systemic toxicity associated with skin erythema and tenderness. Women who have had surgery and lymph node dissection for the treatment of gynecologic cancer usually develop macular erythema and swelling over the lower abdominal wall, inguinal area, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the proximal thigh. Some patients may have raised erythema, which is more characteristic of erysipelas.</p><p>Patients who have suffered recurrent attacks usually recognize the signs and symptoms of cellulitis. Recurrent episodes of cellulitis are similar to previous bouts in terms of symptoms and severity of illness. They usually occur without antecedent precipitating events, although vaginal intercourse appears to initiate the infection in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cellulitis-following-pelvic-lymph-node-dissection/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, for most patients with cellulitis after surgery for gynecologic cancer, specific pathogens are not recovered from clinical specimens. In the minority of cases in which pathogens have been recovered, most of the isolates were non-group A, beta-hemolytic streptococci [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cellulitis-following-pelvic-lymph-node-dissection/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>]. These streptococci appear to have a proclivity to produce soft tissue infections in the setting of venous <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lymphatic compromise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cellulitis-following-pelvic-lymph-node-dissection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> is also an important pathogen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antibiotic therapy is usually empiric, as pathogens are not typically identified, and should include activity against beta-hemolytic streptococci and <em>S. aureus</em>. For most individuals, antibiotic selection is the same as for cellulitis in general &#160; Patients who have purulent disease or particular risk factors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F53504\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53504 \">table 1</a>) may also warrant empiric coverage for methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em> (MRSA) &#160; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cellulitis-and-skin-abscess-in-adults-treatment#H1936863535\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cellulitis and skin abscess in adults: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Clinical approach'</a>.)</p><p>For patients who have received recent chemotherapy and are neutropenic, the antibiotic regimen should be broadened to include coverage for aerobic gram-negative bacilli, including <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-neutropenic-fever-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of neutropenic fever syndromes&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-neutropenic-fever-syndromes-in-adult-cancer-patients-at-low-risk-for-complications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of neutropenic fever syndromes in adult cancer patients at low risk for complications&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The optimal duration of therapy is uncertain. In general antimicrobial therapy should be continued until the clinical signs of infection have resolved. Response to therapy may be slow; in general patients report improvement in pain before there is a noticeable decrease in erythema and swelling.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although there are no clinical trial data addressing the efficacy of chronic suppressive antibiotic therapy in the setting of recurrent cellulitis following lymph node dissection, specifically, the practice is supported by trials that demonstrate benefit in some patients with recurrent, severe bouts of lower extremity cellulitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cellulitis-following-pelvic-lymph-node-dissection/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>]. The regimen can be tailored to the individual circumstances; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cephalexin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cephalexin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> (150 mg PO once daily) are reasonable choices since they have in vitro activity against beta-hemolytic streptococci and <em>S. aureus</em>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H778767682\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
