The resistance most often occurs within the liver (as is the case in cirrhosis), but it can also be prehepatic (eg, portal vein thrombosis) or posthepatic (eg, Budd-Chiari syndrome). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noncirrhotic-portal-hypertension#H64319454\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noncirrhotic portal hypertension&quot;, section on 'Etiology'</a>.)</p><p>There are two components to the increased resistance, structural changes and dynamic changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/portal-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Structural changes occur when there is distortion of the liver microcirculation by fibrosis, nodules, angiogenesis, and vascular occlusion. Dynamic changes occur when there is contraction of activated hepatic stellate cells and myofibroblasts that surround hepatic sinusoids and are in the fibrous septa and vascular smooth muscle cells of the hepatic vasculature. The dynamic changes are thought to be due to increased production of vasoconstrictors (eg, endothelins, angiotensin-II, norepinephrine, thromboxane A2) and reduced release of endothelial vasodilators (eg, nitric oxide).</p><p>As portal hypertension worsens, splanchnic blood flow is increased because of local release of vascular endothelial growth factor, nitric oxide, and other splanchnic vasodilators that cause splanchnic arteriolar vasodilation and angiogenesis. In addition to worsening the portal hypertension, these changes also lead to systemic hypotension, vascular underfilling, stimulation of endogenous vasoactive systems, plasma volume expansion, and increased cardiac output, factors that are important in the development of ascites. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-ascites-in-patients-with-cirrhosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of ascites in patients with cirrhosis&quot;, section on 'Portal hypertension'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H72827663\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The two most common causes of portal hypertension worldwide are cirrhosis and hepatic schistosomiasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/portal-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In Western countries, portal hypertension is typically the result of cirrhosis, with noncirrhotic portal hypertension accounting for less than 10 percent of cases. In other parts of the world, noncirrhotic portal hypertension due to causes such as schistosomiasis and portal vein thrombosis are the leading causes of portal hypertension (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F76516\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76516 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F50663\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50663 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cirrhosis-in-adults-etiologies-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cirrhosis in adults: Etiologies, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noncirrhotic-portal-hypertension#H64319454\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noncirrhotic portal hypertension&quot;, section on 'Etiology'</a>.)</p><p>Among asymptomatic patients with cirrhosis, 80 to 90 percent will have an elevated portal pressure gradient (the difference in pressure between the portal vein and inferior vena cava, normally &le;5 mmHg), 40 percent of whom will have esophageal varices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/portal-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Among those who do not have varices, varices develop at a rate of approximately 6 percent per year. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-and-pre-primary-prophylaxis-against-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary and pre-primary prophylaxis against variceal hemorrhage in patients with cirrhosis&quot;, section on 'Screening for varices'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H72827922\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Portal hypertension is often asymptomatic until complications develop. The clinical manifestations of portal hypertension include splenomegaly, abdominal wall collateral vessels, and thrombocytopenia. Many of the other clinical manifestations seen in patients with portal hypertension are related to the underlying cause of the portal hypertension (eg, spider angiomata and gynecomastia in a patient with cirrhosis) or the complications of portal hypertension. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cirrhosis-in-adults-etiologies-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cirrhosis in adults: Etiologies, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=noncirrhotic-portal-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Noncirrhotic portal hypertension&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Complications of portal hypertension include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Variceal hemorrhage</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Portal hypertensive gastropathy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ascites</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatorenal syndrome</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatic hydrothorax</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatopulmonary syndrome</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Portopulmonary hypertension</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cirrhotic cardiomyopathy</p><p/><p>The clinical manifestations associated with these complications include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Variceal hemorrhage: Patients with variceal hemorrhage typically present with hematemesis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> melena. If the bleeding is severe, there may be signs of hemodynamic instability. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-acute-upper-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-adults#H683979\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding in adults&quot;, section on 'Bleeding manifestations'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Portal hypertensive gastropathy: Portal hypertensive gastropathy (congestive gastropathy), while extremely common in patients with portal hypertension, is an uncommon cause of significant bleeding in these patients. When portal hypertensive gastropathy is the sole cause of bleeding, there is diffuse mucosal oozing with no other lesions such as varices to account for the gastrointestinal bleeding and anemia. The mucosa is friable, and bleeding presumably occurs when the ectatic vessels rupture. The severity of gastropathy is related to the level of portal pressure, the level of hepatic vascular resistance, and the degree of reduction in hepatic blood flow (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=portal-hypertensive-gastropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Portal hypertensive gastropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ascites: Ascites is the accumulation of fluid within the peritoneal cavity. Patients with ascites typically report progressive abdominal distension that may be painless or associated with abdominal discomfort. Patients may also complain of weight gain, shortness of breath, early satiety, and dyspnea resulting from fluid accumulation and increased abdominal pressure. Physical examination findings include abdominal distension, dullness to percussion, and a fluid wave. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-adults-with-ascites#H25272225\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of adults with ascites&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis: Clinical manifestations of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis include fever, abdominal pain, abdominal tenderness, and altered mental status. Some patients are asymptomatic and present with only mild laboratory abnormalities. The new onset of renal failure should prompt an investigation for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spontaneous-bacterial-peritonitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis in adults: Clinical manifestations&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatorenal syndrome: Hepatorenal syndrome refers to the development of renal impairment in the setting of cirrhosis. Arterial vasodilatation in the splanchnic circulation, which is triggered by portal hypertension, appears to play a central role in the hemodynamic changes and the decline in renal function in hepatorenal syndrome. Hepatorenal syndrome is characterized by a generally benign urine sediment, a very low rate of sodium excretion, and a progressive rise in the plasma creatinine concentration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatorenal-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatorenal syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatic hydrothorax: Hepatic hydrothorax is<strong> </strong>defined as the presence of a pleural effusion in a patient with cirrhosis and no evidence of underlying cardiopulmonary disease. It results from the movement of ascitic fluid into the pleural space through defects in the diaphragm and is usually right-sided. The negative intrathoracic pressure generated during inspiration favors the passage of fluid from the peritoneal to the pleural space. Thus, many patients have only mild or no clinically detectable ascites. Patients usually present with shortness of breath, cough, hypoxemia, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chest discomfort. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatic-hydrothorax\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatic hydrothorax&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatopulmonary syndrome: Hepatopulmonary syndrome is defined by the presence of liver disease, an increased alveolar-arterial gradient while breathing room air, and evidence for intrapulmonary vascular abnormalities. The clinical features of hepatopulmonary syndrome are the consequences of both hepatic and pulmonary dysfunction. More than 80 percent of patients present with symptoms of liver disease; the remainder experience dyspnea as their initial symptom. Hypoxia is a common finding. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatopulmonary-syndrome-in-adults-prevalence-causes-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatopulmonary syndrome in adults: Prevalence, causes, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Portopulmonary hypertension: As the name implies, portal hypertension-associated pulmonary hypertension (portopulmonary hypertension) refers to the presence of pulmonary hypertension in patients with portal hypertension. Patients with portopulmonary hypertension may present with fatigue, dyspnea, peripheral edema, chest pain, or syncope. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=portopulmonary-hypertension#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Portopulmonary hypertension&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cirrhotic cardiomyopathy: Cirrhotic cardiomyopathy is defined by chronic cardiac dysfunction in the setting of cirrhosis. It is characterized by decreased contractile responsiveness to stress or altered diastolic relaxation with electrophysiologic abnormalities. It is thought to be related to both portal hypertension and cirrhosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-and-classification-of-the-cardiomyopathies#H29123596\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition and classification of the cardiomyopathies&quot;, section on 'Cirrhotic cardiomyopathy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H72827677\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A diagnosis of portal hypertension can be made if a patient with a known risk factor for portal hypertension (eg, cirrhosis) has clinical manifestations of portal hypertension. In such cases, additional testing is not needed to confirm the diagnosis. However, if the diagnosis is in doubt, the hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) can be determined to help confirm the diagnosis. The HVPG may also aid in the management of patients receiving nonselective beta blockers as part of their treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-and-pre-primary-prophylaxis-against-variceal-hemorrhage-in-patients-with-cirrhosis#H748332\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary and pre-primary prophylaxis against variceal hemorrhage in patients with cirrhosis&quot;, section on 'Dose titration'</a>.)</p><p>In patients with portal hypertension who do not have a previously identified risk factor, additional testing is required to determine the cause. (See <a href=\"#H72827691\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation for an underlying cause'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H72827684\"><span class=\"h2\">Hepatic venous pressure gradient</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The HVPG is measured to approximate the gradient in pressure between the portal vein and the inferior vena cava (IVC). It can quantify the degree of portal hypertension due to sinusoidal resistance to blood flow (the most common cause of portal hypertension) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F90916\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90916 \">table 3</a>). A normal HVPG is between 1 and 5 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/portal-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Portal hypertension is present if the HVPG is &ge;6 mmHg. Portal hypertension typically becomes clinically significant when the HVPG is &ge;10 mmHg, at which point varices may develop. Once the HVPG is &ge;12 mmHg, patients are at risk for variceal bleeding and the development of ascites.</p><p>The portal pressure gradient can also be determined by direct measurement of the pressure in the portal vein and IVC. However, direct measurement of pressure in the portal is more invasive and is associated with a risk of intraperitoneal bleeding, so it is rarely used. (See <a href=\"#H72827719\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications and limitations'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H64700612\"><span class=\"h3\">Prognostic implications of HVPG thresholds</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of developing complications of portal hypertension and mortality rates increase as HVPG values increase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/portal-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

These values are obtained by hepatic vein catheterization. The FHVP is determined by direct measurement of pressure in the hepatic vein. The WHVP is typically obtained by balloon occlusion of the hepatic vein, though it can also be estimated by wedging the catheter in the end tributaries of a hepatic vein. The balloon occlusion technique estimates the pressure from a larger portion of the liver than is obtained if the catheter is wedged in an end tributary.</p><p>After giving the patient light conscious sedation (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midazolam</a>), a balloon-tipped catheter is introduced through the right jugular vein, often under ultrasound guidance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/portal-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The catheter is advanced through the right atrium into the IVC and then into the right hepatic vein using fluoroscopic guidance. Alternatively, the femoral or antecubital veins can be used to for venous access.</p><p>To obtain the FHVP, the catheter is maintained in the hepatic vein 2 to 4 cm from its takeoff from the IVC. Typically, the difference in pressure between the IVC (measured at the hepatic vein ostium) and hepatic vein is &le;1 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/portal-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A difference &gt;1 mmHg suggests incorrect placement of the catheter (too deep into the hepatic vein). Pressure in the right atrium cannot be used to approximate the FHVP.</p><p>To obtain the WHVP, the hepatic vein is occluded by inflating the balloon at the tip of the catheter. A small amount of contrast dye (5 mL) is injected to confirm that the hepatic vein is occluded. If it is occluded, there should be no reflux of the dye above the balloon, and it should not washout via communications with other hepatic veins. Veno-venous communications may lead to washout of the contrast. These communications are rare in cirrhosis, though they are commonly seen in idiopathic portal hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/portal-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. The pressure should not be recorded until a stable value is obtained, which often takes 45 to 60 seconds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/portal-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Once the FHVP and WHVP are determined, the HVPG is calculated by subtracting the FHVP from the WHVP.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H72827719\"><span class=\"h3\">Contraindications and limitations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A limitation of the HVPG is that the WHVP is a measure of pressure within the hepatic sinusoids. As a result, pre-sinusoidal causes of portal hypertension may be associated with a normal FHVP, WHVP, and HVPG (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F90916\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90916 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/portal-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In addition, the HVPG may be normal with post-sinusoidal causes of portal hypertension that increase pressure both in the hepatic vein and in the sinusoids. However, in this situation, both the FHVP and the WHVP will be abnormal. If pre-sinusoidal portal hypertension is suspected and the HVPG is normal, direct measurement of the pressure in the portal vein and IVC can be obtained to determine the portal perfusion gradient. Direct measurement is performed using transhepatic or transvenous catheterization of the portal vein.</p><p>A relative contraindication to HVPG measurement is an allergy to iodinated contrast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/portal-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This can be overcome by using carbon dioxide in place of contrast when confirming balloon occlusion. In patients with a history of cardiac arrhythmias, care should be taken when moving the catheter in the right atrium. Finally, patients with thrombocytopenia or an elevated international normalized ratio may require platelets or fresh frozen plasma, respectively, prior to performing an HVPG measurement.

The resistance most often occurs within the liver (as is the case in cirrhosis), but it can also be prehepatic (eg, portal vein thrombosis) or posthepatic (eg, Budd-Chiari syndrome). (See <a href=\"#H72827656\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The two most common causes of portal hypertension worldwide are cirrhosis and hepatic schistosomiasis. In Western countries, portal hypertension is typically the result of cirrhosis. In other parts of the world, noncirrhotic portal hypertension due to causes such as schistosomiasis and portal vein thrombosis are the leading causes of portal hypertension (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F76516\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76516 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F50663\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50663 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H72827663\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Portal hypertension is typically asymptomatic until complications develop. The clinical manifestations of portal hypertension include splenomegaly, abdominal wall collateral circulation, and thrombocytopenia. Many of the clinical manifestations seen in patients with portal hypertension are related to the underlying cause of the portal hypertension (eg, spider angiomata and gynecomastia in a patient with cirrhosis) or the complications of portal hypertension. (See <a href=\"#H72827922\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The complications of portal hypertension include variceal hemorrhage, portal hypertensive gastropathy, ascites, and spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. Other complications include hepatorenal syndrome, hepatic hydrothorax, hepatopulmonary syndrome, portopulmonary hypertension, and cirrhotic cardiomyopathy. (See <a href=\"#H72827922\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A diagnosis of portal hypertension can be made if a patient with a known risk factor for portal hypertension (eg, cirrhosis) has clinical manifestations of portal hypertension. In such cases, additional testing is not needed to confirm the diagnosis. However, if the diagnosis is in doubt, the hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) can be determined to help confirm the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H72827677\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The HVPG is measured to approximate the gradient in pressure between the portal vein and the inferior vena cava. It can quantify the degree of portal hypertension due to sinusoidal resistance to blood flow (the most common cause of portal hypertension). A normal HVPG is between 1 and 5 mmHg. Portal hypertension is present if the HVPG is &ge;6 mmHg. Portal hypertension typically becomes clinically significant when the HVPG is &ge;10 mmHg, at which point varices may develop. Once the HVPG is &ge;12 mmHg, patients are at risk for variceal bleeding and the development of ascites. (See <a href=\"#H72827684\" class=\"local\">'Hepatic venous pressure gradient'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to management of the underlying cause of the portal hypertension (eg, cirrhosis, schistosomiasis), patients also need treatment to prevent and treat the complications of portal hypertension. In the case of varices, this includes endoscopy to screen for varices, nonselective beta blockers <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> endoscopic variceal ligation to prevent bleeding, and treatment of active hemorrhage with endoscopic therapy or transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt placement. In patients with ascites, treatment often starts with dietary sodium restriction and diuretics.
