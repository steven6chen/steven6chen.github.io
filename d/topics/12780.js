Oxygen delivery and consumption are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxygen-delivery-and-consumption\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oxygen delivery and consumption&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MEASURES OF OXYGENATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are numerous ways to measure whether oxygenation is impaired and at risk of being insufficient to meet the metabolic requirements of the peripheral tissues.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most of the oxygen that diffuses from the alveolus to the pulmonary capillary binds to hemoglobin in red blood cells. The arterial oxygen saturation (SaO<sub>2</sub>) is the proportion of red blood cells whose hemoglobin is bound to oxygen. It is most commonly measured noninvasively by pulse oximetry, but can also be measured by arterial blood gas. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulse-oximetry\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulse oximetry&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arterial-blood-gases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Arterial blood gases&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Abnormal SaO<sub>2</sub> has not been defined because a threshold below which tissue hypoxia occurs has not been identified. This reflects with multifactorial nature of tissue hypoxia. It seems reasonable to consider a resting SaO<sub>2</sub> &le;95 percent or exercise desaturation &ge;5 percent abnormal, although these values should not be considered in isolation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygenation-and-mechanisms-of-hypoxemia/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. As an example, a resting SaO<sub>2</sub> of 95 percent could be abnormal if a patient previously had a resting SaO<sub>2</sub> of 99 percent. However, in general when administering oxygen a resting saturation at sea level should typically target between 94 and 98 percent, unless the patient has COPD in which case 88 to 92 percent is appropriate. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Arterial oxygen tension (PaO2)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A small amount of the oxygen that diffuses from the alveolus to the pulmonary capillary dissolves into the plasma. The arterial oxygen tension (PaO<sub>2</sub>) is the amount of oxygen dissolved in the plasma, which is measured by arterial blood gas. Similar to oxygen saturation, an abnormal PaO<sub>2</sub> has not been precisely defined because a threshold below which tissue hypoxia predictably occurs has not been identified. However, it seems reasonable to consider a PaO<sub>2</sub> &lt;80 mmHg abnormal, although the value should not be considered in isolation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygenation-and-mechanisms-of-hypoxemia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

It is the difference between the amount of the oxygen in the alveoli (ie, the alveolar oxygen tension [PAO<sub>2</sub>]) and the amount of oxygen dissolved in the plasma (PaO<sub>2</sub>) (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-a-a-gradient-alveolar-arterial-gradient-aag\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>):</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p>A-a oxygen gradient = PAO<sub>2</sub> - PaO<sub>2</sub></p></div></div><p>PaO<sub>2</sub> is measured by arterial blood gas, while PAO<sub>2</sub> is calculated using the alveolar gas equation:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p>PAO<sub>2</sub> &#160;= &#160;(FiO<sub>2</sub> &#160;x &#160;[Patm &#160;- &#160;PH<sub>2</sub>O]) &#160;- &#160;(PaCO<sub>2</sub> &#160;&divide; &#160;R)</p></div></div><p>where FiO<sub>2</sub> is the fraction of inspired oxygen (0.21 at room air), Patm is the atmospheric pressure (760 mmHg at sea level), PH<sub>2</sub>O is the partial pressure of water (47 mmHg at 37&ordm;C), PaCO<sub>2</sub> is the arterial carbon dioxide tension, and R is the respiratory quotient. The respiratory quotient is approximately 0.8 at steady state, but varies according to the relative utilization of carbohydrate, protein, and fat.</p><p>The A-a gradient calculated using this alveolar gas equation may deviate from the true gradient by up to 10 mmHg. This reflects the equation's simplification from the more rigorous full calculation and the imprecision of several independent variables (eg, FiO<sub>2</sub> and R).</p><p>The normal A-a gradient varies with age and can be estimated from the following equation, assuming the patient is breathing room air (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-a-a-gradient-alveolar-arterial-gradient-aag\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygenation-and-mechanisms-of-hypoxemia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p>A-a gradient = 2.5 + 0.21 x age in years</p></div></div><p>The A-a gradient increases with higher FiO<sub>2</sub>. When a patient receives a high FiO<sub>2</sub>, both PAO<sub>2</sub> and PaO<sub>2</sub> increase. However, the PAO<sub>2</sub> increases disproportionately, causing the A-a gradient to increase. In one series, the A-a gradient in men breathing air and 100 percent oxygen varied from 8 to 82 mmHg in patients younger than 40 years of age and from 3 to 120 mmHg in patients older than 40 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygenation-and-mechanisms-of-hypoxemia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Proper determinations of the A-a gradient requires exact measurement of FiO<sub>2</sub> such as when patients are breathing room air or are receiving mechanical ventilation. The FiO<sub>2</sub> of patients receiving supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula or mask can be estimated and the A-a gradient approximated but large variations may exist and the A-a gradient may substantially vary from the predicted. The use of a 100 percent non-rebreathing mask reasonably approximates actual delivery of 100 percent oxygen and can be used to measure shunt. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">PaO2/FiO2 ratio</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The PaO<sub>2</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FiO<sub>2</sub></span> ratio is another common measure of oxygenation and is most often employed in ventilated patients. A normal PaO<sub>2</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FiO<sub>2</sub></span> ratio is 300 to 500 mmHg, with values less than 300 mmHg indicating abnormal gas exchange and values less than 200 mmHg indicates severe hypoxemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygenation-and-mechanisms-of-hypoxemia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. As an example, a patient whose PaO<sub>2</sub> is 60 mmHg while receiving an FiO<sub>2</sub> of 0.5 (ie, 50 percent) has a PaO<sub>2</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/FiO<sub>2</sub></span> ratio of 120 mmHg.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">a-A oxygen ratio</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The arterial to alveolar (a-A) oxygen ratio is determined by dividing the PaO<sub>2</sub> by the PAO<sub>2</sub> (&quot;A&quot; denotes alveolar and &quot;a&quot; denotes arterial oxygenation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygenation-and-mechanisms-of-hypoxemia/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p>a-A oxygen ratio = PaO<sub>2</sub> &divide; PAO<sub>2</sub></p></div></div><p>The a-A oxygen ratio is commonly used to predict the change in PaO<sub>2</sub> that will result when the FiO<sub>2</sub> is changed.

Hypoxemia does not necessarily indicate tissue hypoxia. It can be caused by hypoventilation, ventilation-perfusion mismatch, right-to-left shunt, diffusion impairment, or reduced inspired oxygen tension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygenation-and-mechanisms-of-hypoxemia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypoventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The lung alveolus is a space in which gas makes up 100 percent of the contents. This means that once the partial pressure of one gas rises, the other must decrease. Both arterial (PaCO<sub>2</sub>) and alveolar (PACO<sub>2</sub>) carbon dioxide tension increase during hypoventilation, which causes the alveolar oxygen tension (PAO<sub>2</sub>) to decrease. As a result, diffusion of oxygen from the alveolus to the pulmonary capillary declines with a net effect of hypoxemia and hypercapnia. Because the respiratory quotient (Defined as CO<sub>2 eliminated</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">/O<sub>2</span> consumed</sub>) is assumed to be 0.8, hypoventilation affects PaCO<sub>2</sub> more than O<sub>2</sub>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-evaluation-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-the-adult-patient-with-acute-hypercapnic-respiratory-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment of the adult patient with acute hypercapnic respiratory failure&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanisms-causes-and-effects-of-hypercapnia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanisms, causes, and effects of hypercapnia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Hypoxemia due to pure hypoventilation (ie, in the absence of an elevated A-a gradient) can be identified by two characteristics. First, it readily corrects with a small increase in the fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO<sub>2</sub>). Second, the paCO<sub>2</sub> is elevated. An exception exists when the hypoventilation is prolonged because atelectasis can occur, which will increase the A-a gradient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygenation-and-mechanisms-of-hypoxemia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Abnormalities that cause pure hypoventilation include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CNS depression, such as drug overdose, structural CNS lesions, or ischemic CNS lesions that impact the respiratory center</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obesity hypoventilation (Pickwickian) syndrome</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impaired neural conduction, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome, high cervical spine injury, phrenic nerve paralysis, or aminoglycoside blockade</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscular weakness, such as myasthenia gravis, idiopathic diaphragmatic paralysis, polymyositis, muscular dystrophy, or severe hypothyroidism</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Poor chest wall elasticity, such as a flail chest or kyphoscoliosis</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">V/Q mismatch</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ventilation-perfusion <span class=\"nowrap\">(V/Q)</span> mismatch refers to an imbalance of blood flow and ventilation. It causes the composition of alveolar gas to vary among lung regions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lung regions with low ventilation compared to perfusion will have a low alveolar oxygen content and high CO<sub>2</sub> content</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lung regions with high ventilation compared to perfusion will have a low CO<sub>2</sub> content and high oxygen content</p><p/><p>In the normal lung, there is <span class=\"nowrap\">V/Q</span> mismatch because perfusion and ventilation are heterogeneous. Both ventilation and perfusion are greater in the bases than in the apices (when in an upright position). However, the difference between apical and basilar ventilation is smaller than the difference between apical and basilar perfusion. As a result, the <span class=\"nowrap\">V/Q</span> ratio is higher in the apices than in the bases. <span class=\"nowrap\">V/Q</span> mismatch is responsible for the normal A-a gradient.</p><p>In the diseased lung, <span class=\"nowrap\">V/Q</span> mismatch increases because heterogeneity of both ventilation and perfusion worsen. The net effect is hypoxemia. Hypoxemia due to <span class=\"nowrap\">V/Q</span> mismatch can be corrected with low to moderate flow supplemental oxygen and is characterized by an increased A-a gradient. Common causes of hypoxemia due to <span class=\"nowrap\">V/Q</span> mismatch include obstructive lung diseases, pulmonary vascular diseases, and interstitial diseases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Right-to-left shunt</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A right-to-left shunt exists when blood passes from the right to the left side of the heart without being oxygenated. There are two types of right-to-left shunts:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anatomic shunts exist when the alveoli are bypassed. Examples include intracardiac shunts, pulmonary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), and hepatopulmonary syndrome.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physiologic shunts exist when non-ventilated alveoli are perfused. Examples include atelectasis and diseases with alveolar filling (eg, pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome).</p><p/><p>Right-to-left shunts cause extreme <span class=\"nowrap\">V/Q</span> mismatch, with a <span class=\"nowrap\">V/Q</span> ratio of zero in some lung regions. The net effect is hypoxemia, which is difficult to correct with supplemental oxygen.</p><p>The degree of shunt can be quantified from the shunt equation:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p><span class=\"nowrap\">Qs/Qt</span> &#160;= &#160;(CcO<sub>2</sub> &#160;- &#160;CaO<sub>2</sub>) &#160;&divide; &#160;(CcO<sub>2</sub> &#160;- &#160;CvO<sub>2</sub>)</p></div></div><p>where <span class=\"nowrap\">Qs/Qt</span> is the shunt fraction, CcO<sub>2</sub> is the end-capillary oxygen content, CaO<sub>2</sub> is the arterial oxygen content, and CvO<sub>2</sub> is the mixed venous oxygen content. CaO<sub>2</sub> and CvO<sub>2</sub> are calculated from arterial and mixed venous blood gas measurements, respectively. CcO<sub>2</sub> is estimated from the PAO<sub>2</sub>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxygen-delivery-and-consumption#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oxygen delivery and consumption&quot;, section on 'Definitions'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Diffusion limitation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diffusion limitation exists when the movement of oxygen from the alveolus to the pulmonary capillary is impaired. It is usually a consequence of alveolar <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> interstitial inflammation and fibrosis, such as that due to interstitial lung disease. In such diseases, diffusion limitation usually coexists with <span class=\"nowrap\">V/Q</span> mismatch, which makes the relative contribution of each to the patient's hypoxemia uncertain.</p><p>Diffusion limitation is characterized by exercise-induced or -exacerbated hypoxemia. This is illustrated by the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During rest, blood traverses the lung relatively slowly. Thus, there is usually sufficient time for oxygenation to occur even if diffusion limitation exists.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During exercise, cardiac output increases and blood traverses the lung more quickly. As a result, there is less time for oxygenation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In the healthy individuals, several compensatory mechanisms occur. Pulmonary capillaries dilate, which increases the surface area available for gas exchange by perfusing additional regions of lung. PAO<sub>2</sub> also increases, which promotes oxygen diffusion by increasing the oxygen gradient from the alveolus to the artery. The net effect is that full oxygenation is sustained.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In patients with diffusion limitation (such as with pulmonary fibrosis), there is insufficient time for oxygenation to occur. In addition, most such patients have parenchymal destruction, which renders it impossible to recruit additional surface area for gas exchange. The net effect is measurable hypoxemia.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Reduced inspired oxygen tension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The inspired oxygen tension (PiO<sub>2</sub>) is a component of the alveolar gas equation that was described above. It can be determined by the equation:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p>PiO<sub>2</sub> = FiO<sub>2</sub> x (Patm - PH<sub>2</sub>O)</p></div></div><p>where FiO<sub>2</sub> is the fraction of inspired oxygen (0.21 at room air), Patm is the atmospheric pressure (760 mmHg at sea level), and PH<sub>2</sub>O is the partial pressure of water (47 mmHg at 37 degrees C).</p><p>Reduction of the PiO<sub>2</sub> will decrease the PAO<sub>2</sub>. This impairs oxygen diffusion by decreasing the oxygen gradient from the alveolus to the artery. The net effect is hypoxemia. A reduced PiO<sub>2</sub> is most commonly associated with high altitude.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H467959\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFECTS OF HYPOXEMIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypoxemia can adversely affect every tissue in the body. Cellular hypoxia is a state in which there is insufficient oxygen to meet the metabolic demands of a given tissue. It can result from impaired perfusion (ischemia) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diminished arterial oxygen content (due to anemia or hypoxemia).</p><p>Cellular tolerance of hypoxia is variable. As examples, skeletal muscle cells can recover fully after 30 minutes of hypoxia, but irreversible damage occurs in brain cells after only four to six minutes of similar hypoxic stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygenation-and-mechanisms-of-hypoxemia/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Therefore, life-threatening hypoxemia needs to be treated with the administration of oxygen (and sometimes with red cell transfusion) while measures are being initiated to treat the primary cardiopulmonary insult.</p><p>Cellular mechanisms that contribute to hypoxic cell injury include depletion of ATP, development of intracellular acidosis, increased concentrations of metabolic by-products, generation of oxygen free radicals, and destruction of membrane phospholipids. There is also a dramatic increase in intracellular calcium concentration, contributing to cellular injury via a variety of mechanisms, including direct damage to the cytoskeleton and induction of genes that contribute to apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oxygenation-and-mechanisms-of-hypoxemia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Hypoxia also induces an inflammatory reaction characterized by neutrophilic infiltration, thus augmenting cellular damage via release of cytokine mediators, oxygen free radicals, and by intensifying ischemia due to disruption of the microcirculation.</p><p>The American Thoracic Society (ATS) statement on the detection, correction, and prevention of tissue hypoxia, can be accessed through the ATS web site at <a href=\"http://www.thoracic.org/statements/&amp;token=qarzLAn4JdAbZ323FG1scHYDG28iQPBGI48zV/nNgikyfVut82/f14D/ERhZjGMy&amp;TOPIC_ID=1647\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.thoracic.org/statements</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oxygenation is the process of oxygen diffusing passively from the alveolus to the pulmonary capillary, where it binds to hemoglobin in red blood cells or dissolves into the plasma.
