The goal is to establish a pregnancy that is unaffected by specific genetic characteristics, such as a known heritable genetic mutation or chromosomal abnormality (eg, translocations) carried by one or both biological parents. It is also used to select embryos for transfer that have specific characteristics, such as a particular gender or compatible HLA type.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy (PGT-A)</strong> (formerly called preimplantation genetic screening) is performed on cell(s) removed from a preimplantation embryo or a polar body from an oocyte. The goal is to identify de-novo aneuploidy in embryo(s) of couples presumed to be chromosomally normal. Theoretically, avoiding transfer of aneuploid embryos will reduce the risk of pregnancy failure and improve the probability of conceiving a viable pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-testing/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p/><p>When preimplantation genetic testing is planned, assisted reproductive technology (ART) must be used for conception even if infertility is not an issue for the couple. ART is expensive, intrusive, and associated with risks, such as ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome, multiple gestations and risks to singleton gestations, that occur less frequently in natural conceptions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=in-vitro-fertilization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;In vitro fertilization&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intracytoplasmic-sperm-injection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intracytoplasmic sperm injection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic will discuss issues related to PGD. PGT-A is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preimplantation-genetic-screening\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preimplantation genetic screening&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">OBTAINING DNA FOR ANALYSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Genetic testing is performed on DNA from a cell removed from an oocyte or preimplantation embryo or from 5 to 10 cells removed from a blastocyst. The DNA must be obtained at a time when removal does not disrupt the ability of the oocyte or embryo to progress in its normal development. Micromanipulations required for PGD do not appear to adversely affect embryo development to the blastocyst stage, but the process can result in the loss of some embryos that are biopsied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-testing/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>To obtain genetic material for analysis, a laser, acid Tyrode's solution, or a sharpened glass needle is used to create an opening in the zona pellucida [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-testing/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. The polar body, blastomere (ie, a cell produced during cleavage of a fertilized egg), or trophectoderm cells (ie, cells from the outer layer of the blastocyst destined to form the placenta) are extracted using a small pipette and gentle suction or by gently compressing the oocyte or early embryo to extrude the cells through the opening. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Polar body biopsy (PBB)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PBB is only useful for evaluation of maternally-inherited mutations. The genetic composition of the oocyte can be inferred from analysis of the first and the second polar body [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-testing/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. If the mother is heterozygous for a known mutant allele, division of the diploid primary oocyte at meiosis I may result in a normal (&quot;wild-type&quot;) secondary oocyte and a first polar body with the same mutant allele (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F53222\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53222 \">figure 1</a>). PBBs that demonstrate normal alleles are presumed to be associated with oocytes that have the mutant alleles: these oocytes would not be used to achieve pregnancy. Conversely, PBBs demonstrating the mutant alleles are presumed to be associated with oocytes with normal alleles and these oocytes are then used for in vitro fertilization.</p><p>One disadvantage of PBB is the genetic phenomenon of recombination (&quot;crossing-over&quot;) that occurs during meiosis between homologous chromosomes. If a single crossing-over event involves the region containing the candidate gene, the single chromosome would not contain both alleles. Specifically, the two chromatids of the single chromosome would become heterozygous and thus biopsy of only the first polar body would not permit an accurate prediction of the genetic composition of the oocyte. This problem can be addressed by removal and analysis of both polar bodies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F53222\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53222 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-testing/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The likelihood of recombination and diagnostic errors is increased for genes close to the telomeric (distal) region of the chromosome, as genes closer to the centromeric (central) region are far less likely to cross over.</p><p>PBB is not useful if the mother is affected (homozygous) by an autosomal recessive disorder since all of her oocytes will carry the mutation. Blastomere or blastocyst biopsy to assess both maternal and paternal genes in the developing embryos is necessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Blastomere biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The embryo typically contains 6 to 10 cells on day 3 after fertilization. Compaction of the embryo has not yet occurred so one or two nucleated cells (blastomeres) can be teased apart from their sibling blastomeres and removed for genetic analysis relatively easily. A randomized trial showed that embryonic development was reduced if more than one blastomere was removed at this stage, but more than one cell may be needed because biopsy of only one cell significantly lowered the efficiency of a PCR-based diagnosis (the efficiency of the fluorescence in situ hybridization [FISH] PGD procedure remained similar whether one or two cells were removed) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-testing/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Delivery rates (live birth per started cycle), however, were significantly lower when biopsy and cell removal were performed on day 3 (cleavage stage) embryos compared with biopsies performed on day 5 or 6 (blastocyst stage) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-testing/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Genetic analysis must be completed by day 6 after fertilization, or the embryo must be frozen, because implantation should occur by that time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Blastocyst biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>By five to six days following fertilization, the blastocyst contains hundreds of cells. Biopsy of trophectoderm cells overlying the anembryonic pole on a day 5 or day 6 healthy blastocyst can provide two to three dozen cells for genetic analysis without compromising its viability. Usually small biopsies of five to eight cells are removed to limit disruption to the developing embryo. Compared to other techniques for obtaining preimplantation DNA, blastocyst biopsy is the least disruptive to subsequent development while providing the most DNA for testing, which reduces the possibility of diagnostic errors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-testing/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In a randomized trial, blastocyst biopsy resulted in a similar outcome as nonbiopsied controls while cleavage-stage biopsy reduced the probability of an embryo having sustained implantation and progressing to delivery although there was a significant selection bias against day-3 embryos in this study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-testing/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Unfortunately, there is a significant loss of embryos in vitro between the eight cell and blastocyst stage because of laboratory-related factors leading to fewer surviving embryos available for biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-testing/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Additionally, blastocysts developed in vitro appear to be at increased risk of monozygotic twinning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-testing/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Biopsy of embryos that have developed to the blastocyst stage, however, might reduce overall cost since fewer embryos, only those that are the most viable, are biopsied.</p><p>PGT-M and PGT-A by noninvasive sampling from a blastocoele (fluids inside of a blastocyst) or spent culture medium has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-testing/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>], but its clinical efficacy needs to be further validated. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETIC EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many genetic disorders are caused by single-gene defects. These genetic defects often involve a mutation in a single base pair that results in abnormal protein secretion. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), gene sequencing, or single nucleotide polymorphism arrays using linked markers are used to test for gene defects. To detect differences in gene sequences between cells, PCR is used to amplify the segment of the genome that contains the specific gene of interest. Nested primer PCR provides the means to obtain millions of copies of the gene of interest and test for mutations using mutation-specific primers, digestion with restriction enzymes, or heteroduplex analysis. Amplification of the entire genome and analysis with single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray-based technology, such as KaryoMapping, as well as targeted or whole genome sequencing, is now more commonly used for detecting single gene defects. In addition, multiple mutations as well as aneuploidy can be screened for simultaneously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-testing/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tools-for-genetics-and-genomics-cytogenetics-and-molecular-genetics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tools for genetics and genomics: Cytogenetics and molecular genetics&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-chromosomal-microarray-in-obstetrics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of chromosomal microarray in obstetrics&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In one study, selection of embryos for transfer based on the combination of conventional PGD for single gene defects and microarray-based&nbsp;24 chromosome aneuploidy testing increased the pregnancy rate per transfer compared with selection based on PGD for single gene defects alone (68 versus 45 percent); there was also a threefold reduction in the spontaneous abortion rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-testing/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tools-for-genetics-and-genomics-polymerase-chain-reaction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tools for genetics and genomics: Polymerase chain reaction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tools-for-genetics-and-genomics-cytogenetics-and-molecular-genetics\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tools for genetics and genomics: Cytogenetics and molecular genetics&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Limitations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After biopsy at the blastocyst stage, the embryo must be vitrified (frozen) until results of the analysis are available. If the cell removed for analysis has no nucleus, no DNA amplification will occur and no diagnosis can be made. Embryos biopsied at cleavage stage can be re-biopsied at the blastocyst stage in case of failed amplification. Embryos biopsied at blastocyst stage can be warmed, re-biopsied, and re-frozen until the results of repeat testing are available. Alternatively, errors can result when one allele for the gene of interest fails to amplify (&quot;allele drop-out&quot;) or amplifies poorly (&quot;partial amplification&quot;). Both types of technical failure have been described and have resulted in misdiagnoses leading to the transfer of an affected embryo believed to be normal, or the discarding of a normal embryo thought to be affected. Misdiagnosis has been substantially reduced because two modifications in the protocols: (1) more cells are biopsied and (2) linkage markers (Short Tandem Repeats <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> SNPs) are used. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Counseling'</a> below.)</p><p>Inadvertent amplification of contaminating extraneous DNA can lead to false negative results and transfer of abnormal embryos thought to be normal. Laboratories performing PCR on single cells must take extra precautions to prevent this error.</p><p>False negative errors for many diseases have occurred following IVF with PGD. The true risk for obtaining a clinically relevant false negative result can be determined only by further genetic testing of all conceptions after PGD, but no such studies have been conducted. The reported error rate with PCR was 12 cases in 2538 cycles. However, the actual rate will only be known with prospective reporting and auditing of outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-testing/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">REASONS COUPLES CHOOSE TO UNDERGO PGD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Conventional prenatal diagnostic techniques (amniocentesis, chorionic villus sampling, fetal blood sampling) are performed weeks to months after implantation of the pregnancy. If test results show that the fetus carries an undesired genetic characteristic, the only available intervention is pregnancy termination.</p><p>By comparison, PGD enables establishment of pregnancies that are much less likely to be affected by specific known genetic characteristics. However, in vitro fertilization with or without intracytoplasmic sperm injection is required even though many of these couples have no known difficulties conceiving a pregnancy. The inconvenience, risks, and expense of these additional procedures limit the actual utilization of this technology by couples at risk of transmitting a genetic disease or attempting to select for specific characteristics in offspring. Nevertheless, surveys of couples at high risk of transmitting a genetic disorder report that 30 to 74 percent would prefer PGD to conventional prenatal diagnosis procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-testing/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>The following clinical situations illustrate potential reasons couples choose to conceive via assisted reproductive technology and undergo PGD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Unable or unwilling to undergo pregnancy termination of an affected fetus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PGD gives couples the ability to reduce the likelihood of an in utero pregnancy in which the fetus is ascertained to have inherited a familial disorder. This is important for couples who would be unable or unwilling to terminate an affected pregnancy, but are able to discard affected oocytes and preimplantation embryos.</p><p>Some genetic mutations do not cause disease, but confer an increased risk of developing a disease. As an example, BRCA mutation carriers have a predisposition to developing breast and ovarian cancer. Some couples choose to use PGD to avoid the transfer of embryos with these types of mutations, given the increased risk of serious disease and the stress associated with this knowledge.</p><p>The ethics committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) has stated that PGD for adult-onset conditions is &ldquo;ethically justifiable when the conditions are serious and when there are no known interventions for the conditions or the available interventions are either inadequately effective or significantly burdensome. For conditions that are less serious or of lower penetrance, PGD for adult onset conditions is ethically acceptable as a matter of reproductive liberty&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-testing/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Reduce high risk of recurrent pregnancy loss</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 2 to 4 percent of couples experiencing recurrent pregnancy loss will have one partner with an identifiable balanced translocation as a potential cause of the losses. There is an increased risk that the partner's gametes will have an unbalanced genetic composition due to excess or missing genetic material. Embryos derived from these unbalanced gametes will usually miscarry. PGD of the oocytes or embryos using telomeric probes for the translocated segment or microarrays to detect the extra or missing regions of the chromosome and avoiding <span class=\"nowrap\">fertilization/transfer</span> of these <span class=\"nowrap\">gametes/embryos</span> appears to significantly reduce the frequency of miscarriage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-testing/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>], although it might not enhance the overall probability of live birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-testing/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In one literature review including six studies, the rate of miscarriage without PGD ranged from 26 to 64 percent versus 5 to 15 percent with PGD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-testing/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. This review also observed that use of PGD appeared to shorten the time it took to conceive a pregnancy that resulted in live birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-testing/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Genome sequencing can also be used for this purpose if the <span class=\"nowrap\">deleted/duplicated</span> chromosome segment is included in the analysis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Increase chances of giving birth to a child with a compatible HLA type for stem cell therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stem cell transplantation has significantly improved the prognosis for many life-threatening diseases. One such example is children affected with Fanconi's anemia. Identification of a disease-free embryo that is also HLA compatible to the affected child and can provide cord blood stem cells for transplantation will significantly improve the probability of survival of the affected sibling. PGD has been used successfully to identify HLA-compatible unaffected embryos to permit treatment of an affected sibling by cord blood transfusion or bone marrow transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-testing/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=collection-and-storage-of-umbilical-cord-blood-for-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Collection and storage of umbilical cord blood for hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;</a>.) One caveat of this remarkable technology is that very few of the embryos tested (about 16 percent) will be both unaffected and an HLA match for the affected sibling.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Preimplantation sex selection to avoid sex-linked disorders in offspring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ideally, PGD would identify unaffected males so that these embryos, as well as noncarrier females, could be transferred preferentially. In situations where the gene mutation causing the disease is on a sex chromosome but has not yet been identified or the disease preferentially affects children of one sex (ie, autism has a 4:1 male-to-female ratio), PGD for the presence or absence of the Y chromosome enables the clinician to limit transfer of embryos to only those of the desired gender [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-testing/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In a large European database, Duchenne muscular dystrophy and hemophilia were the most common medical conditions where preimplantation sex selection was utilized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-testing/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Sex selection for social reasons is more controversial. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the ASRM ethics committees are unanimous in their position against offering sex selection in the absence of disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-testing/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. Sex selection in the absence of a medical indication, however, is being performed and was the reason for PGD in 2.3 percent of PGD cases in the European database, based on voluntary reporting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-testing/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=techniques-for-preimplantation-sex-selection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Techniques for preimplantation sex selection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Avoid passing a suspected but unconfirmed autosomal dominant disease to offspring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One of the most difficult situations encountered in centers performing PGD is the request for testing embryos for late onset autosomal dominant diseases (eg, Huntington's chorea). Patients often present when an older parent is diagnosed and they are made aware that they have a 50 percent chance of carrying the mutation causing disease. Many patients do not want to know if they are carriers of the mutated gene for personal and insurance reasons; however, if they inherited it from their parent, they want to make sure that they do not pass the gene to their offspring.</p><p>In these situations, PGD with &quot;non-disclosure&quot; can be performed. The patient undergoes an egg retrieval, the eggs are fertilized, but the results (number of eggs, embryos, the number of embryos transferred, the results of the genetic testing) are not divulged to the patient. If the genetic parent is a carrier, disclosing this information might tip them off to their genetic status. If there are no normal embryos available, sometimes a &quot;mock&quot; embryo transfer with no actual embryos being transferred is performed.</p><p>A challenging ethical situation is when the patient is found not to be a carrier of the mutation, based on the results of the initial cycle of in vitro fertilization (IVF) and PGD. Since providing this information would constitute disclosure, some clinicians would not inform the patient and allow the patient to plan and undertake future pregnancies using IVF and PGD, despite costs and risks involved.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">COUNSELING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Couples who are considering PGD must be aware of its limitations, as well as the risk of misdiagnosis. Therefore, counseling by an experienced individual prior to proceeding is extremely important [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-testing/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The following points are key elements of the counseling process and informed consent.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Causes of unanticipated birth of an affected offspring include: unprotected sex resulting in pregnancy, transfer of the wrong embryo and other human errors, haploid cells, contamination, allele drop out, and uniparental disomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-testing/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The actual rate of misdiagnosis, if known, should be discussed. It can be difficult to define since misdiagnosed embryos that don't result in live births are not recognized. The risk for misdiagnosis due to allele drop-out or partial amplification depends directly on the type of genetic disorder for which testing is performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-testing/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>]. The estimated risk of transferring an affected embryo mistakenly identified as normal by PGD is approximately 2 percent for recessive disorders and 11 percent for dominant disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-testing/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Analysis for linked markers will reduce this error rate significantly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-testing/abstract/19,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis Consortium offers members the ability to report misdiagnoses anonymously. As of 2005, 24 misdiagnoses and adverse outcomes were reported in 15,158 cycles (0.16 percent); <span class=\"nowrap\">12/2538</span> cycles (0.5 percent) after polymerase chain reaction and <span class=\"nowrap\">12/12,620</span> cycles (0.1 percent) after fluorescence in situ hybridization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preimplantation-genetic-testing/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Reasons couples choose to undergo PGD'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>DNA for analysis is obtained from a polar body, one or two blastomeres obtained from the 6 to 9 cell mass day 3 after fertilization, or trophectoderm cells from a blastocyst on day 5 or day 6 after fertilization. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Obtaining DNA for analysis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Polymerase chain reaction, array comparative genomic hybridization, gene sequencing, or single nucleotide polymorphism arrays using linked markers are used to test for gene defects.

(See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Reasons couples choose to undergo PGD'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is a small but nonzero rate of false positive and false negative results. Therefore, chorionic villus biopsy or genetic amniocentesis is recommended to confirm PGD findings. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Counseling'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PGD may decrease the chance of achieving pregnancy and live birth below that with natural conception, but there does not appear to be any long-term harm to offspring.
