However, the clinician still needs to be aware of presenting symptoms and signs of these uncommon infections, which may occur in the immunosuppressed patient with untreated or drug-resistant HIV infection. </p><p>This topic will address pulmonary infections related to <em>Toxoplasma gondii</em>, <em>Strongyloides stercoralis</em>, <em>Cryptosporidium</em>, and <em>Microsporidium </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxoplasma-pneumonia-and-other-parasitic-pulmonary-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. A more general overview of pulmonary disease in the HIV-infected patient is found elsewhere.

Although <em>T. gondii</em> can infect a wide range of vertebrates, feral and domestic cats are the definitive hosts. The organism undergoes its complete life cycle in the cat, resulting in the production of oocytes, which are passed with the feces into soil. Oocytes may remain infective for over one year. If ingested, <em>Toxoplasma</em> can invade tissue and reproduce. </p><p>The two routes of transmission to humans are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ingestion of food or beverages contaminated with sporulated oocytes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transmission from mother to fetus.</p><p/><p>There is no evidence of any other type of human-to-human transmission. Additional information on the transmission of toxoplasmosis is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=toxoplasmosis-in-immunocompetent-hosts#H1131788570\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Toxoplasmosis in immunocompetent hosts&quot;, section on 'Transmission'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3095112485\"><span class=\"h2\">Epidemiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>T. gondii</em> is generally believed to cause subclinical infection in most immunocompetent hosts, but one review found that one-third of the reported cases of active pneumonia were in patients with no underlying immunosuppressive illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxoplasma-pneumonia-and-other-parasitic-pulmonary-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Of the remaining two-thirds, 61 percent had AIDS and 39 percent had other forms of immunosuppression. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulmonary-infections-in-immunocompromised-patients#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulmonary infections in immunocompromised patients&quot;, section on 'Toxoplasmosis'</a>.)</p><p>Most active cases of <em>T. gondii</em> disease in people with AIDS are due to reactivation of latent infection. Approximately one-third of adults in the United States are IgG seropositive for <em>T. gondii</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxoplasma-pneumonia-and-other-parasitic-pulmonary-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In HIV-infected individuals who are seropositive for <em>T. gondii</em>, it is estimated that approximately 30 percent will develop <em>Toxoplasma</em> encephalitis within two years of the initial diagnosis of AIDS without antiretroviral therapy (ART); another 1 percent who are seronegative will develop primary toxoplasmosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxoplasma-pneumonia-and-other-parasitic-pulmonary-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>Although encephalitis is overwhelmingly the most common manifestation of <em>T. gondii</em> infection in patients with AIDS, pneumonitis has become its second most common presentation. The incidence of pneumonitis is unknown, but one report estimated the prevalence of <em>T. gondii</em> pneumonia in France to be 5 percent, based upon a prospective study of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) specimens in 169 patients with AIDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxoplasma-pneumonia-and-other-parasitic-pulmonary-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Rates in the United States seem to be much lower, which may be due to lower rates of latent infection. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Active pulmonary toxoplasmosis does not usually occur in HIV-infected patients until the CD4 count falls below 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxoplasma-pneumonia-and-other-parasitic-pulmonary-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. <em>Toxoplasma</em> pneumonitis typically presents with fever, nonproductive cough, and dyspnea. </p><p>The chest radiographs generally show diffuse bilateral interstitial and alveolar infiltrates. Other abnormalities include single or bilateral pulmonary nodules, cavitary infiltrates, lobar pneumonia, and pleural effusions. Reports of gallium scans in patients with <em>T. gondii</em> pneumonitis are rare, but diffuse intense uptake is reported. Serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels may be markedly elevated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxoplasma-pneumonia-and-other-parasitic-pulmonary-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serologic tests for IgG, IgM, IgA, and IgE to <em>T. gondii</em> are available, but the results are usually not helpful in the profoundly immunosuppressed patient. However, the absence of IgG antibody to <em>T. gondii</em> does make the diagnosis much less likely, since most active disease is due to reactivation of latent infection.</p><p>If <em>Toxoplasma</em> pneumonitis is being considered, bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (with or without transbronchial biopsy) is the preferred method of diagnosis, but its sensitivity and specificity are unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxoplasma-pneumonia-and-other-parasitic-pulmonary-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. The diagnosis is confirmed by observing the tachyzoite form of the organism in the BAL fluid or transbronchial biopsy. The most reliable methods of detection are Giemsa staining or <span class=\"nowrap\">eosin/<a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylene-blue-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylene blue</a></span> staining. The tachyzoite is 5 to 7 microns in length and is crescent-shaped. Immunofluorescence staining with a monoclonal antibody, polymerase chain reaction testing, or inoculation of mice followed by traditional culture may increase the yield of BAL, but most of these methods are not readily available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxoplasma-pneumonia-and-other-parasitic-pulmonary-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p>If bronchoscopy is not diagnostic, then an open lung biopsy can be performed, either by video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery or traditional thoracotomy. Pathologically, a fibrinous exudate can be seen in the bronchi and alveoli, with an inflammatory cell interstitial infiltrate and areas of parenchymal necrosis. The organism may be seen within alveolar macrophages or freely floating within the alveoli. Unfortunately, the diagnosis of <em>Toxoplasma</em> pneumonitis is usually made by postmortem examination of the lungs, because it is often not considered premortem, and the special stains that are needed to make the diagnosis are not requested. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1687013098\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pulmonary toxoplasmosis may be clinically indistinguishable from other infections seen in patients with AIDS, such as <em>Pneumocystis jirovecii</em> (previously named <em>Pneumocystis carinii</em>) pneumonia, tuberculosis, cryptococcosis, or histoplasmosis. The differential diagnosis of pulmonary infiltrates in patients with AIDS is presented elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-pneumocystis-pulmonary-infection-in-hiv-infected-patients#H115377349\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of Pneumocystis pulmonary infection in HIV-infected patients&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment of toxoplasmosis in HIV-infected patients includes antimicrobial therapy directed against <em>T. gondii</em>, as well as ART for immune recovery. (See <a href=\"#H1676837120\" class=\"local\">'When to initiate antiretroviral therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>The combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyrimethamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pyrimethamine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfadiazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulfadiazine</a> is the regimen of choice for treatment of toxoplasmosis. However, when access to pyrimethamine is limited, an alternative regimen (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a>) is required. The regimens used for pulmonary disease are the same as those used for <em>Toxoplasma</em> encephalitis since there are no controlled studies specifically designed for lung involvement. The preferred and alternative regimens are described in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=toxoplasmosis-in-hiv-infected-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Toxoplasmosis in HIV-infected patients&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=toxoplasmosis-in-hiv-infected-patients#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Toxoplasmosis in HIV-infected patients&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p>The exact duration of therapy for <em>Toxoplasma </em>pneumonitis is unknown. We generally administer three to six weeks of induction therapy, depending upon the severity of the disease and the response to treatment. Some studies suggest successful treatment outcomes in 50 to 77 percent of patients, although the number of cases of pulmonary toxoplasmosis is small [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxoplasma-pneumonia-and-other-parasitic-pulmonary-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Maintenance therapy (also called secondary prophylaxis) is prudent after initial treatment because relapses of toxoplasmosis may occur despite successful therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/toxoplasma-pneumonia-and-other-parasitic-pulmonary-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

However, strongyloides should be considered in the differential diagnosis of HIV-infected patients with pulmonary disease if they have previously lived or currently reside in endemic areas. Other risk factors for developing hyperinfection secondary to strongyloidiasis include high-dose glucocorticoids, organ transplantation, and HTLV-1 infection.
