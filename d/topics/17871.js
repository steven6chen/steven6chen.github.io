Patients with profound prolonged neutropenia are at particularly high risk for serious infections; profound prolonged neutropenia is most likely to occur in the preengraftment phase of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT; particularly allogeneic) and in patients undergoing induction chemotherapy for acute leukemia.</p><p>Because neutropenic patients are unable to mount robust inflammatory responses, serious infection can occur with minimal symptoms and signs. In such patients, fever is often the only sign of infection. Infections in neutropenic patients can progress rapidly, leading to hypotension <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> other life-threatening complications. It is critical to recognize neutropenic fever early and to initiate empiric systemic antibacterial therapy promptly in order to avoid progression to a sepsis syndrome and possibly death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-neutropenic-fever-syndromes-in-adults-with-hematologic-malignancies-and-hematopoietic-cell-transplant-recipients-high-risk-patients/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>The use of empiric antibacterial and antifungal therapy for high-risk neutropenic adults presenting with fever will be reviewed here.

The mortality rate depended upon the underlying malignancy: 8 percent in patients with solid tumors, 8.9 percent in patients with lymphoma, and 14.3 percent in patients with leukemia. The number of major comorbid conditions also significantly affected the mortality rate. Patients without any comorbidities had a 2.6 percent risk of dying compared with 10.3 percent for patients with one comorbidity, 21.4 percent for patients with two comorbidities, 38.6 percent for patients with three comorbidities, and 50.6 percent for patients with four comorbidities.</p><p>Outcomes are poor in neutropenic patients who are critically ill.

Because neutropenic patients are unable to mount robust inflammatory responses, serious infection can occur with minimal symptoms and signs. In such patients, fever is often the only sign of infection. It is critical to recognize neutropenic fever early and to initiate empiric systemic antibacterial therapy promptly in order to avoid progression to a sepsis syndrome and possibly death. (See <a href=\"#H154973506\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is crucial to assess the risk of serious complications in patients with neutropenic fever, since this assessment will dictate the approach to therapy, including the need for inpatient admission, intravenous (IV) antibiotics, and prolonged hospitalization. High-risk neutropenic patients are those with an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> expected to last &gt;7 days or evidence of ongoing comorbid conditions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F67027\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67027 \">table 1</a>). Profound prolonged neutropenia is most likely to occur in the preengraftment phase of hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT; particularly allogeneic) and in patients undergoing induction chemotherapy for acute leukemia. (See <a href=\"#H154973748\" class=\"local\">'Risk of serious complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H154974613\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial empiric therapy</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever in high-risk neutropenic patients should be considered a medical emergency. Empiric broad-spectrum antibacterial therapy should be initiated immediately after blood cultures have been obtained and before any other investigations have been completed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F60657\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef60657 \">algorithm 1</a>). Antibiotics should be administered within <strong>60 minutes</strong> of presentation in patients presenting with neutropenic fever. Some investigators have argued that initial empiric antimicrobial therapy should be administered within 30 minutes; we agree that antibiotics should be given as early as possible. (See <a href=\"#H154974106\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above and <a href=\"#H468185456\" class=\"local\">'Timing of antibiotics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial antibiotic selection should be guided by the patient's history, allergies, symptoms, signs, recent antibiotic use and culture data, and awareness of institutional nosocomial infection and susceptibility patterns. Ideally, antibiotics should be bactericidal. (See <a href=\"#H154974106\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For high-risk patients with neutropenic fever, we recommend empiric monotherapy with an antipseudomonal beta-lactam agent, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefepime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefepime</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meropenem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meropenem</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imipenem-and-cilastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imipenem</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=piperacillin-and-tazobactam-sodium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">piperacillin-tazobactam</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F60657\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef60657 \">algorithm 1</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Because of high rates of resistance, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftazidime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftazidime</a> is no longer recommended at most centers, but it is reasonable to use it at centers with low rates of resistance. (See <a href=\"#H154974278\" class=\"local\">'Initial regimen'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend against the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> (or another agent that targets gram-positive cocci) as a standard part of the initial regimen (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). In contrast, gram-positive coverage should be added in patients with suspected central venous catheter&ndash;related infection, skin or soft tissue infection, pneumonia, or hemodynamic instability. For patients with complicated presentations (eg, hypotension; central venous catheter, skin, or soft tissue infections; pneumonia), coverage should be broadened to cover the likely pathogens (eg, resistant gram-negative, gram-positive, and anaerobic bacteria as well as fungi). (See <a href=\"#H154974278\" class=\"local\">'Initial regimen'</a> above and <a href=\"#H154974343\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotic resistance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H154974621\"><span class=\"h2\">Empiric therapy for persistent fever</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persistent fever alone in an otherwise stable patient is <strong>not</strong> sufficient justification for modification of the initial antibiotic regimen. However, modifications to the initial regimen should be considered for patients at risk for infection with antibiotic-resistant organisms, for patients who are clinically unstable, and for patients who have positive blood cultures that are suggestive of a resistant infection. (See <a href=\"#H154974321\" class=\"local\">'Modifications to the regimen'</a> above and <a href=\"#H423440041\" class=\"local\">'Persistent fever'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who remain febrile after the initiation of empiric antibiotics should be reevaluated for possible infectious sources.

(See <a href=\"#H154974321\" class=\"local\">'Modifications to the regimen'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend the empiric addition of an antifungal agent for neutropenic patients who are persistently febrile after four to seven days despite broad-spectrum antibacterials and who have no documented source of infection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F53163\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef53163 \">algorithm 3</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>).

In such patients, we favor <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a> or a lipid formulation of amphotericin B.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For persistently febrile patients who have been receiving anti-mold prophylaxis, a different class of antifungal agent with activity against molds should be used for empiric therapy.
