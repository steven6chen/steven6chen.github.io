Brainstem gliomas are heterogeneous, ranging from low-grade tumors that need little treatment to high-grade lesions that are rapidly fatal despite aggressive therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-brainstem-glioma/abstract/1-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-7</a>]. Prognosis and treatment depend upon histologic features and the location within the brainstem (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F53866\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53866 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Focal brainstem gliomas typically arise in the midbrain and medulla, and are discrete, well-circumscribed tumors without evidence of locally invasive growth or edema. Pathologically, these tumors are most often pilocytic or fibrillary astrocytomas, or rarely, gangliogliomas, all of which are considered low-grade tumors&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-brainstem-glioma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. These tumors share many biologic features with posterior fossa and supratentorial low-grade gliomas, and significant advances in the analysis of the signaling pathways involved in their pathogenesis have been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-brainstem-glioma/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-pathologic-diagnosis-of-gliomas\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and pathologic diagnosis of gliomas&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Approximately 80 percent of pediatric brainstem gliomas arise within the pons, while the remaining 20 percent occur within the medulla, midbrain, and cervicomedullary junction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-brainstem-glioma/abstract/11-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-17</a>].</p><p>Brainstem gliomas arising the in pons are predominantly diffuse and high-grade; in contrast, most brainstem gliomas arising outside the pons are focal and low grade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-brainstem-glioma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Focal brainstem gliomas are discussed here. Diffuse pontine gliomas are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diffuse-intrinsic-pontine-glioma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Brainstem tumors are more common in children than adults, with approximately 300 pediatric and 100 adult cases reported each year in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-brainstem-glioma/abstract/13,15,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,15,18,19</a>]. Brainstem gliomas now account for about 20 percent of all intracranial neoplasms in children under the age of 15 years, compared to 10 percent in the 1970s and 1980s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-brainstem-glioma/abstract/20-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-24</a>]. This change appears to reflect the increased detection of focal low-grade brainstem tumors by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) rather than a true increased incidence.</p><p>In children, the median age at diagnosis is five to nine years of age. Within this age group, brainstem malignancies are nearly as common as cerebral malignancies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F75349\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75349 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-brainstem-glioma/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The incidence is approximately equal between males and females [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-brainstem-glioma/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>].</p><p>The only known risk factor for both low-grade and high-grade brainstem gliomas is neurofibromatosis type I (von Recklinghausen syndrome). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neurofibromatosis-type-1-nf1-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H1815234\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1): Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Other central nervous system neoplasms'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Brainstem tumors have been classified descriptively as diffuse gliomas, intrinsic gliomas, midbrain tumors, tectal gliomas, dorsal exophytic brainstem tumors, focal medullary tumors, cervicomedullary tumors, focal gliomas, and cystic gliomas. However, from a histologic standpoint, they can be classified simply as low-grade or high-grade gliomas, with most high-grade gliomas originating in the pons. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diffuse-intrinsic-pontine-glioma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Up to 80 percent of brainstem gliomas that occur outside the pons are low-grade (WHO grade I and II tumors, (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F109509\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109509 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F109511\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109511 \">table 2</a>))&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-brainstem-glioma/abstract/11-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-16</a>]. The remaining 20 percent are high-grade gliomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-brainstem-glioma/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. The WHO grading system for gliomas is based upon the presence or absence of malignant features (hypercellularity, nuclear atypia, mitoses, vascular hyperplasia, necrosis) within a tumor of astrocytic origin (positive for glial acidic fibrillary protein [GFAP]). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-pathologic-diagnosis-of-gliomas\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and pathologic diagnosis of gliomas&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Low-grade astrocytomas are characterized by varying degrees of cellularity and occasional nuclear atypia, although they lack other features of malignancy. The histology of grade I tumors (pilocytic astrocytomas) is distinctive, usually consisting of biphasic microcystic areas interspersed between more compacted and cellular areas with extensive fibrillary processes and associated Rosenthal fibers (composed of alpha-B crystallin) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-brainstem-glioma/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Occasionally there may be a large macrocystic structure containing a mural nodule. Pilocytic astrocytomas can possess a few mitoses and vascular proliferation without elevation to a higher grade. Grade II astrocytomas lack microcystic structures and Rosenthal fibers, but otherwise resemble grade I lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-brainstem-glioma/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Recent advances in the molecular analysis of pediatric low-grade gliomas, including those of the brainstem, have identified characteristic duplications involving the <em>BRAF</em> gene in pilocytic astrocytomas (<em>KIAA1549-BRAF</em> fusion) and mutation (<em>BRAF</em> V600E) in a number of fibrillary astrocytomas, gangliogliomas, and pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma. When combined with the known association of low-grade astrocytomas in patients with NF1, the <span class=\"nowrap\">ras/raf</span> pathway has generated significant interest in the prognostic and therapeutic options for these tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-brainstem-glioma/abstract/30-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-38</a>]. </p><p>Another marker that has become an important prognostic variable in adult low-grade gliomas is mutant isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (<em>IDH1</em>). For reasons that are not well understood, pediatric low grade gliomas rarely harbor <em>IDH1</em> mutations except in adolescent and young adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-brainstem-glioma/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=molecular-pathogenesis-of-diffuse-gliomas#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Molecular pathogenesis of diffuse gliomas&quot;, section on 'Formation of astrocytoma'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Tumor growth patterns</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The growth patterns of low-grade gliomas are strongly influenced by anatomic boundaries, whereas high-grade lesions do not respect these borders. Patterns of growth seen on neuroimaging studies are suggestive of histologic grade, although many tumors do not follow these patterns.</p><p>Examples of the relationship between tumor location and anatomic extension include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low-grade tumors that arise at the cervicomedullary junction are limited in their rostral extension by the decussation of the pyramidal tracts, the internal arcuate fibers, the medial lemniscus, and the efferent fibers of the inferior olivary nucleus. While low-grade tumors arising from this region can displace these structures rostrally, they do not penetrate them. Instead, as these tumors grow, they expand dorsally at the level of the obex (the midline of the dorsal surface of the medulla, marking the caudal angle of the fourth ventricle) through the relatively soft ependymal lining of the fourth ventricle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F53866\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53866 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tumors arising within the medulla grow rostrally until they reach the level of the pontocerebellar tracts. Further growth gives rise to a distinctive dorsally exophytic pattern, sometimes effacing the fourth ventricle.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tumors of the cervical cord and the cervicomedullary junction have no rostral-caudal barriers to growth; as a result, they may grow rostrally beyond the foramen magnum. Growth is limited circumferentially by the pia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-brainstem-glioma/abstract/7,11,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,11,15</a>]. Axial (towards the crown) growth is limited by the pyramidal decussations located ventrally at the cervicomedullary junction, at which point the tumor grows posteriorly, creating a bulge in the dorsal aspect of the medulla, towards the fourth ventricle. A small proportion of lesions in this location are high-grade. Because of their infiltrative growth pattern, they grow through the decussations and do not produce the typical posterior bulge.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with low-grade brainstem gliomas have a relatively long history of minor symptoms and signs, which may have been present for over a decade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-brainstem-glioma/abstract/7,11-16,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,11-16,40</a>]. Signs and symptoms generally reflect the location of the tumor, the presence of hydrocephalus, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the age of the child. Most tumors produce some neck stiffness or discomfort; some patients may even present with torticollis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-torticollis-in-children#H5681683\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired torticollis in children&quot;, section on 'Central nervous system tumor'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-neck-stiffness-in-children#H17810584\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to neck stiffness in children&quot;, section on 'Other central nervous system lesions'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Small focal tumors of the midbrain or medulla usually present insidiously, with a long history of localizing findings such as an isolated cranial nerve deficit or contralateral hemiparesis. Signs and symptoms of raised intracranial pressure are uncommon.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dorsally exophytic tumors and focal tumors of the tectum, the dorsal aspect of the rostral or upper midbrain, typically present with headache, vomiting and ataxia secondary to aqueductal occlusion and hydrocephalus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F75349\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75349 \">figure 2</a>). Cranial nerve deficits are seen in about one-half of patients, but long tract signs are distinctly unusual. Symptoms referable to brainstem dysfunction (eg, Parinaud syndrome) may occur (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81227\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81227 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=supranuclear-disorders-of-gaze-in-children#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Supranuclear disorders of gaze in children&quot;, section on 'Parinaud syndrome'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medullary tumors can be associated with cranial nerve dysfunction, dysphagia, nasal speech, and apnea. Patients may also have weakness, ataxia, nausea, and vomiting. Rarely, a focal pontine tumor can produce facial and auditory nerve dysfunction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cervicomedullary junction tumors can cause hemiparesis or quadriparesis from upper motor neuron dysfunction, as well as weakness, muscle atrophy, and loss of reflexes from lower motor nerve dysfunction. Hydrocephalus is uncommon, but patients may have apnea, sensory deficits, headache, vomiting, and cranial neuropathies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-brainstem-glioma/abstract/14,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,40</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Imaging studies are the standard method to diagnose and classify brainstem tumors, since the eloquent location of most lesions makes it difficult or impossible to obtain an adequate tissue sample in many cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-brainstem-glioma/abstract/12,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,41</a>]. MRI is the method of choice to image the brainstem, since many of these lesions are isointense on CT scanning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-brainstem-glioma/abstract/40,42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,42,43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">MRI appearance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>On MRI, focal low-grade brainstem gliomas most often appear as masses of limited size (&lt;2 cm) that may be cystic, well demarcated, noninfiltrating, and without associated edema. They are typically isointense or hypointense on T1-weighted images, hyperintense on T2-weighted images, and enhance uniformly and brightly with intravenous contrast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-brainstem-glioma/abstract/41,44-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,44-46</a>]. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and white matter tractography are very useful in documenting axonal degeneration of the motor and sensory tracts in focal brain stem tumors. These imaging sequences may assist in surgical planning for biopsy or tumor debulking. Additionally, advanced imaging may assist in prognostication of possible functional tract recovery following therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-brainstem-glioma/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Focal tumors of the midbrain can contain calcifications and enhance poorly with contrast [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-brainstem-glioma/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Findings on MRI and magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) often permit the differentiation of low-grade brainstem gliomas from high-grade lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-brainstem-glioma/abstract/11,44,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,44,46</a>]. A stereotactic biopsy is indicated if the diagnosis cannot be established by imaging.</p><p>MRI is particularly helpful for tectal gliomas, whose imaging appearance typically is uniform, with a nonenhancing thickening of the tectal plate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-brainstem-glioma/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. The noninfiltrative nature of these masses, their dorsal exophytic growth pattern, and associated hydrocephalus all suggest a low-grade tumor. The pattern of enhancement may also lend support, as grade I tumors are often diffusely enhanced with gadolinium, grade II tumors are often nonenhancing, while high-grade pontine gliomas often demonstrate ring-enhancement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-brainstem-glioma/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Tectal plate tumors are usually diagnosed based upon their characteristic MRI appearance and presence of hydrocephalus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-brainstem-glioma/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diffuse-intrinsic-pontine-glioma#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma&quot;, section on 'Neuroimaging'</a>.) </p><p>The MRI signal characteristics of cervicomedullary lesions are similar to those of other low-grade astrocytomas, with intense T2 signal and low T1 signal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-brainstem-glioma/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. A cystic area is usually present, often within a dorsal exophytic component. Tumors with a dorsally exophytic component are usually associated with hydrocephalus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-brainstem-glioma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Magnetic resonance spectroscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is increasingly utilized as a diagnostic technique for brain tumors and is particularly helpful for the differentiation of locally infiltrative brain tumors from other well-circumscribed intracranial lesions. MRS measurement of tumor-associated choline and N-acetylaspartate and their ratio (Cho:NAA) may help distinguish high-grade from low-grade lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-brainstem-glioma/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>].</p><p>MRS may also provide prognostic information. In one report of 11 children with low grade gliomas, five of six tumors that progressed within two years of surgery had a high normalized Cho:NAA ratio (greater than one), while all of the nonprogressors had a ratio below one [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-brainstem-glioma/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. </p><p>Advanced imaging techniques including diffusion, perfusion, and spectral imaging combined with PET scanning can provide important information on the grade and expected behavior of adult brainstem lesions as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-brainstem-glioma/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of brainstem gliomas requires a consideration of the anatomic location of the tumor, which determines both symptoms and accessibility to surgical resection. The long-tern prognosis of patients with brainstem low-grade glioma is excellent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-brainstem-glioma/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>Optimal treatment requires a team that includes experienced neurosurgeons, radiation oncologists, and neurooncologists, as well as psychosocial workers, educational specialists, and physical and occupational therapists. Such multidisciplinary care is best delivered at a specialized tertiary care centers with a dedicated neurooncology program.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Therapeutic approaches</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical resection, radiation therapy (RT), and chemotherapy each can play a role in the management of patients with focal brainstem gliomas.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Historically, the location of brainstem gliomas in one of the most eloquent areas of the CNS was thought to preclude surgery, and most patients were treated with radiation therapy (RT).</p><p>However, improved intraoperative imaging and guidance technologies have enhanced the surgeon's ability to maximally resect these tumors while preserving normal tissue and function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-brainstem-glioma/abstract/54-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">54-61</a>]. Although there are no randomized trials, resection has become the preferred treatment for focal brainstem gliomas in surgically accessible locations, such as at the cervicomedullary junction in selected cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-brainstem-glioma/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>] and for dorsal exophytic lesions. PET imaging can improve the localization of higher-grade regions within brainstem tumors and help guide the location of biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-brainstem-glioma/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. In patients for whom resection is contraindicated, stereotactic biopsy can provide important histologic information to guide further therapy in both pediatric [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-brainstem-glioma/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>] and adult patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-brainstem-glioma/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p>Approximately 30 percent of resected tumors will progress and require further therapy. A second operation can be considered for patients with surgically accessible disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-brainstem-glioma/abstract/66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67</a>]. For others, the most reasonable option is chemotherapy in children and focal RT in adults.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Radiation therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radiation therapy (RT) provides an important alternative for focal brainstem lesions that are surgically inaccessible. Treatment with external beam RT, using standard fractionation, controls approximately 50 to 70 percent of focal lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-brainstem-glioma/abstract/3,13,68-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,13,68-70</a>]. With this approach, the total radiation dose is 54 Gy, delivered in once daily fractions, five days a week for six weeks to a limited volume with a 0.5 to 1 cm margin. Similar results have been obtained in small numbers of patients treated with hyperfractionated RT (multiple daily treatments with smaller than conventional fraction sizes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-brainstem-glioma/abstract/46,71-75\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,71-75</a>], although no benefit has been demonstrated from this approach.</p><p>Although RT may result in long-term progression-free survival, it can be associated with significant morbidity, especially in very young children. Long-term effects include reduced growth and other endocrinopathies secondary to dose to the pituitary gland and hypothalamus, cognitive and hearing deficits, vascular stenosis leading to stroke, as well as a risk of secondary treatment-induced malignancy. Thus, RT should be limited to older children and adults whenever possible to minimize late morbidity. The delayed complications of cranial irradiation are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=delayed-complications-of-cranial-irradiation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Delayed complications of cranial irradiation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Advances in the use of RT for brainstem gliomas have focused on decreasing morbidity by limiting the radiation dose to normal tissue. The techniques that have been used include stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT), stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS), proton beam irradiation, and intensity modulated RT (IMRT). Although these approaches have not been compared to conventional external beam RT in patients with focal low-grade brainstem gliomas, clinical practice has been influenced by trials performed in more common tumors, such as low-grade optic pathway gliomas or medulloblastomas.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stereotactic radiotherapy &ndash; SRT utilizes a fixation or other stable frame system that establishes a patient-specific coordinate system for the treatment process. Following frame placement, imaging studies are performed to localize the target volume within the fixation device coordinates. Fiducial markers attached to the frame, and built-in scales indicate the coordinate system on images. The target is viewed and the position determined in the frame coordinates. Once the target is identified and the desired dose chosen, the treatment planning will then determine the field size, coordinates and relative weights to be delivered for coverage of the target. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stereotactic-cranial-radiosurgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stereotactic cranial radiosurgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stereotactic radiosurgery &ndash; SRS uses a single fraction, high-dose, small-field irradiation to treat the target. The head-frame for this generally requires placement of small screws into the skull. Frameless systems have recently been developed to replace the invasive head-frame. Stereotactic radiotherapy uses a removable head-frame for multiple fractions with conventional daily doses rather than a single high-dose treatment. There is limited but promising experience with SRS for focal brainstem gliomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/focal-brainstem-glioma/abstract/76-79\" class=\"abstract_t\">76-79</a>]. Tumor growth can be controlled and neurologic symptoms improved in patients with deep-seated low grade gliomas, or recurrent disease, but patient selection and choice of radiation dose is important to avoid treatment-related complications.
