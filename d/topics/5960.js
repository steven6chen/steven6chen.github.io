It is also called &quot;the morning after pill,&quot; or &quot;plan B.&quot; A woman might use emergency contraception if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>She forgot to take her birth control pills</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A condom broke or slipped off during sex</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>She had sex without using birth control</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>She was raped</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H47665832\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there different types of emergency contraception?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. There are 2 types of emergency contraception. One type is pills. The other is a device that goes inside your body. It is called a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=copper-intrauterine-device-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">copper intrauterine device</a>, or an &quot;IUD.&quot; If you want an IUD, a nurse or doctor needs to put it in within 5 days of when you had sex. The IUD works as both emergency contraception and as ongoing birth control. It prevents pregnancy as long as it is in place. The copper IUD is the most effective form of emergency contraception.</p><p>If you weigh 165 pounds (75 kilograms) or more, you might want to consider a copper IUD instead of emergency contraception pills. That's because the pills might not work as well in women who weigh more than this. If you decide you want an IUD, your doctor or nurse can tell you more about it. If you are overweight but prefer pills over an IUD, one type of pill, called &quot;<a href=\"topic.htm?path=ulipristal-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ulipristal</a>&quot; (described below) might be more effective than the other pill options.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H47665839\"><span class=\"h1\">Do I need to see a doctor or nurse to get emergency contraception pills?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>That depends on the kind of pill you would like.</p><p>There are 3 types of emergency contraception pills.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pills containing a hormone called &quot;<a href=\"topic.htm?path=levonorgestrel-systemic-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">levonorgestrel</a>&quot; are sold both with and without a prescription. In the United States, one brand, called &quot;Plan B One-Step,&quot; is available without a prescription. There are other brands and generic versions, too. Some require a prescription. For others, you need to be 17 to buy them. Depending on the brand and dose, you might get 1 pill or 2. Levonorgestrel is sold at many drug stores or at Planned Parenthood.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Birth control pills can also be used as emergency contraception, but you have to take more than one pill at a time to keep from getting pregnant. This approach works, <strong>but it is less effective and more likely to cause nausea than </strong><a href=\"topic.htm?path=levonorgestrel-systemic-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">levonorgestrel</a>. The table tells you which birth control pills you can use for emergency contraception, which color pills to take, and how many (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F74604\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74604 \">table 1</a>). Birth control pills require a prescription. Talk to your doctor or nurse to make sure you are taking the correct pills and dose.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A third kind of emergency contraception pill is called &quot;<a href=\"topic.htm?path=ulipristal-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ulipristal</a>&quot; (brand names: ella, ellaOne). You need a prescription to get it.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H47665846\"><span class=\"h1\">When do I take emergency contraception pills?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Take the pills as soon as possible after you have sex. The pills can work up to 5 days after you have sex, but the sooner you take them, the better they work.</p><p>Hormonal emergency contraception works best if you take it within 3 days of having unprotected sex. It is less effective if you take it 3 to 5 days after unprotected sex. If it has been 3 or more days since you had unprotected sex, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ulipristal-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ulipristal</a> or the copper IUD might be a better option for you. Both are more effective than hormonal emergency contraception if it has been 3 to 5 days since you had unprotected sex. If you took ulipristal and you normally use birth control pills, wait at least 5 days before starting your regular pills again. That's because ulipristal can cause problems with the way birth control pills work. Even after you start taking your pills again, you should still use a condom every time you have sex until your next period.</p><p>If you have sex again after you take the pills, you can still get pregnant. Make sure you use a condom or another type of birth control if you have sex again after you took emergency contraception.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1750571\"><span class=\"h1\">How well do emergency contraception pills work?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a lot of factors that affect how well the pills work, including how soon you take them, where you are in your cycle, and how much you weigh. If you weigh 165 pounds (75 kilograms) or more, the pills might not work well and you might want to get a copper IUD instead.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H47665853\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I throw up?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Emergency contraception pills make some women throw up. If you throw up less than an hour after you take the pills, you have to take them again. Before you take them again, take a medicine that helps keep you from throwing up called &quot;<a href=\"topic.htm?path=meclizine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">meclizine</a>.&quot; You can get meclizine without a prescription. It is sold in drug stores under the brand names Antivert, Bonine, Dramamine, and Medi-Meclizine. If you throw up with birth control pills, try <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levonorgestrel-systemic-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">levonorgestrel</a> instead. Levonorgestrel is less likely to make you throw up.</p><p>If you throw up within 3 hours of taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ulipristal-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ulipristal</a>, call your doctor or nurse. He or she can tell you if you should take another pill.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H47665860\"><span class=\"h1\">Get it before you need it</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Even though some types of hormonal emergency contraception are sold without a prescription, it is not always easy to find. You might want to buy some to keep at home, even if you don't need it now. That way you will have it, just in case.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H47665867\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens after I take emergency contraception?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You should get your period within a week of when you expect it. If you took <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ulipristal-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ulipristal</a>, don't be surprised if your period is a few days late. That's normal. But if you do <strong>not</strong> get your period within 3 or 4 weeks, no matter which form of emergency contraception you took, get a pregnancy test. The pills might not have worked. If you keep bleeding or have pain in your belly, see your doctor or nurse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H47665874\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=choosing-birth-control-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Choosing birth control (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-contraception-morning-after-pill-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Emergency contraception (morning after pill) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
