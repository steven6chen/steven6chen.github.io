The clinical characteristics include age at onset, body distribution, temporal pattern, coexistence of other movement disorders, and other neurologic manifestations. The etiologic characteristics are the presence or absence of nervous system pathology and the pattern of inheritance.</p><p>This topic will review the classification, clinical features, and evaluation of dystonia. Treatment options for dystonia are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-dystonia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of dystonia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The revised classification system for dystonia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F59278\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59278 \">table 1</a>) is based upon clinical characteristics (axis 1) and etiology (axis 2).</p><p>The clinical features important for the classification of dystonia are age of onset, body distribution, temporal pattern, and associated features (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F59278\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59278 \">table 1</a>). Early-onset (ie, age &le;21 years) dystonia most often begins with symptoms in the limbs, typically the leg, and spreads to other body areas to become generalized in over 50 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-evaluation-of-dystonia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In contrast, late-onset (ie, age &gt;21 years) dystonia most frequently begins in the neck, arm, or face and tends to remain focal or segmental. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Early-onset isolated dystonia'</a> below and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Adult-onset focal or segmental isolated dystonia'</a> below.)</p><p>Several presentations of dystonia (eg, a child with onset in the neck or face, or an adult with onset in the leg, or an adult who develops generalized dystonia) are not characteristic of isolated dystonia or the most common genetically determined form (DYT-TOR1A) of dystonia; they indicate the need to evaluate for an underlying cause. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Isolated torsion dystonia (previously known as primary dystonia, primary torsion dystonia, dystonia musculorum deformans, and Oppenheim dystonia) presents with signs related solely to dystonia and may have associated tremor but lacks additional neurologic, laboratory, or imaging abnormalities. The onset and progression of symptoms is gradual and usually without fixed postures. However, contractures may sometimes develop in areas chronically affected by dystonia, particularly if the dystonia is present at rest as well as with action. Isolated torsion dystonia may be sporadic or inherited. Most early-onset isolated torsion dystonia is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern with a reduced penetrance of 30 percent.</p><p>The etiologic categories for the classification of dystonia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F59278\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59278 \">table 1</a>) are the presence or absence of nervous system pathology, and the distinction among inherited (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F70477\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70477 \">table 2</a>), acquired (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F51622\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51622 \">table 3</a>), and idiopathic forms. Inherited dystonias are those with proven genetic origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-evaluation-of-dystonia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Since the discovery of DYT-TOR1A, the first gene mutation to be cloned, many additional genetic forms of dystonia have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-evaluation-of-dystonia/abstract/3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-7</a>]. In the older system, chronologically assigned, consecutively numbered locus symbols (DYT1 to DYT23) were used to represent the expanding list of hereditary dystonias (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F56658\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56658 \">table 4</a>). However, this system proved unsatisfactory for many reasons, including symbols of questionable significance, known pathogenic mutations whose genes did not have DYT symbols, and assignment of syndromes with prominent dystonia to loci suggesting other movement disorders (eg, PARK13) or assignment of other movement disorders to loci suggesting dystonia (eg DYT3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-evaluation-of-dystonia/abstract/3,5,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,7</a>]. The newer but still evolving method (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F70477\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70477 \">table 2</a>) uses the molecular genetic abnormality (if known) in place of a numeral (eg, DYT-TOR1A rather than DYT1) with the goal of providing more informative symbols that include only confirmed disease-causing mutations.</p><p>Secondary dystonia is the term previously used for dystonia with a known acquired cause (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F51622\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51622 \">table 3</a>), or for dystonia with additional neurologic signs (now referred to as combined dystonia) such as muscle weakness, spasticity, ataxia, ocular motility abnormalities, retinal abnormalities, cognitive impairment, or seizures. Acquired dystonia usually arises from a specific underlying condition (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F51622\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51622 \">table 3</a>), such as perinatal brain injury or exposure to dopamine receptor blocking drugs (eg, tardive dystonia). The presence of other neurologic abnormalities may provide the clue to the cause of the dystonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-evaluation-of-dystonia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Brain MRI findings vary with the etiology.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22163793\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no consistent neuropathologic findings in isolated dystonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-evaluation-of-dystonia/abstract/9-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-13</a>]. The lack of cell degeneration suggests that isolated dystonia is a dynamic disorder, arising from abnormal cell function.</p><p>The anatomic localization and specific neurotransmitter defects of dystonia have also been elusive. In patients with hemidystonia, lesions of the basal ganglia or its outflow on head CT or neuropathologic examination were associated with contralateral dystonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-evaluation-of-dystonia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Neuroimaging studies with positron emission tomography (PET) and functional MRI have shown that dystonia can be associated with abnormal activity in multiple regions of the brain, including motor cortex, supplementary motor areas, cerebellum, and basal ganglia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-evaluation-of-dystonia/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p>Data from electrophysiologic testing (eg, blink reflex recovery) and functional imaging studies suggest that the pathophysiology of dystonia, in particular the task-specific dystonias, may arise from a decrease of central inhibitory mechanisms, an increase of plasticity, or an impairment in sensory function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-evaluation-of-dystonia/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p>Direct microelectrode recordings obtained in patients with dystonia during electrode implantation for deep brain stimulation have shown alterations in mean discharge rates, somatosensory responsiveness, and altered patterns of neuronal activity in the globus pallidus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-evaluation-of-dystonia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. These recordings have given rise to new constructs for diagrams of the basal ganglia and its involvement in dystonia, in which the modulating influences within the basal ganglia change with activity, reflecting the movement-dependent nature of dystonia.</p><p>The underlying neurochemistry of dystonia is not known, but dopaminergic and cholinergic neurotransmitter systems may be involved.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal dopaminergic activity in the basal ganglia is indirectly suggested by extrapolation from observations that dopamine receptor antagonism can cause acute and chronic dystonic symptoms (eg, oculogyric crisis and tardive dystonia) and that dystonia is often associated with Parkinson disease, a disorder with marked dopamine depletion. The co-occurrence of parkinsonism and dystonia in dopa-responsive dystonia further implicates a role for dopamine in the pathogenesis of dystonia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cholinergic mechanisms are suggested by the success of anticholinergic therapy, mainly in children with dystonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-evaluation-of-dystonia/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dystonia affects approximately 0.6 to 732 per 100,000 people, depending on the populations assessed and the methods of ascertainment, with focal dystonia being the most frequent in an office setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-evaluation-of-dystonia/abstract/21-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-27</a>]. In a 2012 systematic review and meta-analysis, the overall prevalence of primary (ie, isolated) dystonia was 16.4 per 100,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-evaluation-of-dystonia/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The variability among these studies may arise from different methodologies of case identification, and differences in the demographic and ethnic composition of the populations assessed. However, focal dystonia is more common in all studies, and is estimated to be approximately 10 times more frequent than generalized dystonia. Cervical dystonia is the most frequent type of focal dystonia.</p><p>Efforts are ongoing to develop a practical, reliable, and validated screening tool for dystonia that can be applied to large populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-evaluation-of-dystonia/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. In the absence of such an instrument, under-diagnosis and misdiagnosis are likely major confounders. As an example, a study of familial dystonia found that one-half of the cases were not previously diagnosed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-evaluation-of-dystonia/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dystonia is characterized by involuntary, sustained muscle contractions that result in twisting and repetitive movements or abnormal postures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-evaluation-of-dystonia/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. The sustained movements of dystonia may have overlying spasms that resemble tremor but can be distinguished from essential tremor by the directional quality of the movement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-evaluation-of-dystonia/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Of note, dystonic tremor of the hands, head, and voice often accompanies focal and generalized dystonia. Dystonic tremor tends to be less rhythmic than the more common essential tremor and more likely to be task specific when it affects the limbs. However, dystonic tremor can mimic essential tremor and some cases labeled as essential tremor are more likely to have cervical dystonia with prominent dystonic tremor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-evaluation-of-dystonia/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. &#160;</p><p>Dystonia is a dynamic disorder that changes in severity, depending upon activity and posture. An example of this is writer&rsquo;s dystonia (see <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Writer's dystonia'</a> below), a type of task-specific hand dystonia that involves the hand and arm and is present only during the action of writing but not during any other activity.</p><p>A common feature of dystonia is the sensory trick or &quot;geste antagoniste.&quot; The sensory trick is a maneuver (eg, lightly touching the affected body part) that reduces or abolishes the dystonic symptoms. It is found in approximately 60 percent of patients. In some patients, these tricks may be effective if imagined but not performed physically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-evaluation-of-dystonia/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>A number of dystonia syndromes are recognized (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F59044\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59044 \">table 5</a>), including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Isolated dystonia:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Early-onset generalized isolated dystonia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Focal or segmental isolated dystonia with onset in adulthood</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Combined dystonia:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Dystonia-parkinsonism</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Myoclonus-dystonia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Paroxysmal dyskinesia with dystonia</p><p/><p>These are discussed in the sections that follow.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">EARLY-ONSET ISOLATED DYSTONIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early-onset dystonia usually begins in a leg, often as inversion of the foot. Initially, the dystonia might be triggered only by vigorous physical activity such as running. Over time, the posturing becomes susceptible to triggering by minimal physical activity, such as walking or standing. Subsequently, the dystonia may be present even at rest.</p><p>Dystonia with focal onset in childhood often will progress to generalized dystonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-evaluation-of-dystonia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. With early-onset focal dystonia, spread from one leg to other body areas, including the other leg, torso, arms, and upper body, occurs in approximately 50 to 90 percent of children, usually within five years of onset. However, when early-onset dystonia begins in the arm in late childhood and adolescence, it tends to have a lower likelihood of subsequent spread.</p><p>In isolated dystonia, cognition and intellectual abilities remain intact despite the presence of significant movement abnormalities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F70065\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70065 \">table 6</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3959523\"><span class=\"h2\">DYT-TOR1A dystonia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many patients with hereditary dystonia have early-onset generalized DYT-TOR1A dystonia (locus symbol DYT1), which is caused by a mutation in the TOR1A gene that maps to chromosome 9q34 and encodes torsinA, an ATP-binding protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-evaluation-of-dystonia/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. A three-base pair deletion (c.907_909delGAG)&nbsp;results in loss of a glutamic acid residue in the C-terminal region of the torsinA protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-evaluation-of-dystonia/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>DYT-TOR1A dystonia typically begins in childhood with limb onset, followed by progression to generalized dystonia. However, the phenotypic spectrum of DYT-TOR1A dystonia is broad, and late onset can occur. In one study with 97 genetically confirmed TOR1A carriers, the mean age at onset was 14 years, with a range from 4 to 44 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-evaluation-of-dystonia/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>DYT-TOR1A dystonia accounts for approximately 40 to 65 percent of early-onset isolated generalized dystonia in non-Jewish populations and 90 percent of early-onset limb dystonia in the Ashkenazi Jewish population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-evaluation-of-dystonia/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Inheritance is autosomal dominant, but penetrance is reduced to approximately 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-evaluation-of-dystonia/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Thus, most mutation carriers do not express clinically apparent disease. Because of the reduced penetrance, DYT1-TOR1A should be considered even when there is no apparent family history to suggest a hereditary form of dystonia.</p><p>The pathogenic mechanism for DYT-TOR1A dystonia is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-evaluation-of-dystonia/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Although the function of torsinA protein product is not known, it has been hypothesized to play an important role in protein folding. In one study, using human neuroblastoma cells in culture, wild type torsinA co-localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and nuclear envelope, whereas mutant torsinA showed perinuclear staining and formed distinct globular inclusions that contain vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2). Since VMAT2 plays an important role in the exocytosis of monoamines in neurons, it may be that mutant torsinA may interfere with VMAT2 expression and dopamine release.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3959809\"><span class=\"h2\">DYT-THAP1 dystonia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Adolescent-onset dystonia of mixed type (DYT-THAP1, locus symbol DYT6) was initially described in Amish-Mennonite families and characterized as an early-onset, cranial-cervical dystonia with autosomal dominant inheritance and a penetrance of 60 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-evaluation-of-dystonia/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. Causative mutations in the THAP1 gene on chromosome 8 were discovered as founder mutations in the Amish-Mennonite families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-evaluation-of-dystonia/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. Involvement of cranial muscles, leading to disabling dysarthria or dysphonia, was thought to be characteristic of DYT-THAP1 dystonia.</p><p>Subsequent investigations of patients with non-DYT-TOR1A, familial, early-onset, generalized dystonia showed that there were additional mutations in the THAP1 gene besides those reported in the Amish-Mennonite families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-evaluation-of-dystonia/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. These additional THAP1 mutations were found in 25 percent of the families studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-evaluation-of-dystonia/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>], suggesting that THAP1 mutations could be responsible for a substantial proportion of familial non-DYT-TOR1A early-onset isolated dystonia in patients of European descent, including those of German, Irish, and Italian ancestry. In another study that screened over 1200 subjects with dystonia and 600 controls, a mutation in THAP1 was found in 18 affected subjects and one asymptomatic carrier from 16 families with primary dystonia, and in one normal control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-evaluation-of-dystonia/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. The phenotype of the patients with THAP1 dystonia was highly variable, with age of onset ranging from 8 to 69 years (mean 48 years), and with site of onset predominantly cervical and laryngeal. The dystonia remained focal in 15 of 18 patients (83 percent).</p><p>THAP1 encodes for a transcription regulating protein that modulates other target genes, including the TOR1A gene associated with DYT-TOR1A dystonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-evaluation-of-dystonia/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>]. Genetic studies in humans and animals have shown that the wild-type THAP1 protein binds to the TOR1A gene promoter region and represses the expression of torsinA, while pathophysiologic THAP1 mutations abolish the interaction between THAP1 protein and the TOR1A promoter, leading to decreased repression of TOR1A [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-evaluation-of-dystonia/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>]. Thus, these findings suggest a common molecular pathway linking DYT-TOR1A and DYT-THAP1.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">ADULT-ONSET FOCAL OR SEGMENTAL ISOLATED DYSTONIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In contrast to early-onset dystonia, adult-onset focal or segmental isolated dystonia often begins in the upper body, usually in the arm, neck, face, or larynx [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-evaluation-of-dystonia/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Onset is usually after age 30 years. Although symptoms may worsen in the area of involvement or spread to contiguous body regions (segmental dystonia), adult-onset dystonia rarely becomes generalized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-evaluation-of-dystonia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Regional spread to contiguous body areas is most frequently observed with blepharospasm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-evaluation-of-dystonia/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>]. Most cases are sporadic without identifiable cause.</p><p>Infrequently, late-onset isolated dystonia begins in the leg. However, onset in the leg in an adult is usually secondary to an underlying etiology such as early-onset Parkinson disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-evaluation-of-dystonia/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p>Generalized dystonia is rare with adult onset. In such cases, an acquired etiology should be sought (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F51622\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51622 \">table 3</a>), such as exposure to dopamine receptor antagonists. Hemidystonia is infrequent, and is usually due to an underlying structural or metabolic cause. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Late-onset (age &gt;21 years) isolated focal or segmental dystonia may involve different body areas.

One confirmed form is adult-onset cranial-cervical dystonia (DYT-GNAL), as discussed below. Other rare genetic forms of focal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> segmental dystonia have also been reported but are not yet confirmed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-evaluation-of-dystonia/abstract/55-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">55-59</a>]. Additional gene loci linked to dystonia are certain to be identified in the future.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Cervical dystonia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cervical dystonia, also known as spasmodic torticollis, is the most common isolated focal dystonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-evaluation-of-dystonia/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. It affects the muscles of the neck and shoulders. It may appear as horizontal turning of the head (torticollis), lateral tilt of the neck (laterocollis), flexion of the head (anterocollis), or extension of the head (retrocollis). Overlying spasms may give rise to a head tremor that is distinguished from essential tremor by the directional preponderance of the movement. In a study of 14 subjects with cervical dystonia, two distinct types of oscillatory head movements were identified using a magnetic search coil system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-evaluation-of-dystonia/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. One type was characterized by a relatively larger amplitude and a jerky irregular pattern, suggestive of dystonic tremor.

Dystonia is often initiated or worsened by voluntary action and associated with overflow muscle activation. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction and definition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The current classification system for dystonia is based upon clinical characteristics and etiology (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F59278\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59278 \">table 1</a>). Important clinical characteristics are age at onset, body distribution (ie, focal, segmental, multifocal, generalized, or hemidystonia), temporal pattern, and associated features (eg, isolated dystonia or dystonia combined with another movement disorder). Important etiologic characteristics are the type of nervous system pathology, if known, and whether the dystonia is inherited (and the pattern of inheritance), acquired, or idiopathic. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The pathogenesis of most forms of isolated dystonia is largely unknown. There are no consistent neuropathologic features. Multiple brain areas may be involved, including basal ganglia, motor cortex, supplementary motor areas, and cerebellum. Abnormalities in dopaminergic and cholinergic neurotransmitter systems may play a role. (See <a href=\"#H22163793\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prevalence of dystonia is estimated to be between 2 to 7500 per million people, depending on the populations assessed and the methods of ascertainment. Focal dystonia is approximately 10 times more frequent than generalized dystonia. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early-onset dystonia presents in childhood or young adulthood. It most often begins with symptoms in the limbs, typically the leg, often as intorsion of the foot. It spreads to other body areas to become generalized in over 50 percent, usually within five years of onset. Cases may be sporadic, familial, genetically defined, or idiopathic. Genetically defined types include (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Early-onset isolated dystonia'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Early-onset generalized dystonia (see <a href=\"#H3959523\" class=\"local\">'DYT-TOR1A dystonia'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Adolescent-onset dystonia of mixed type (see <a href=\"#H3959809\" class=\"local\">'DYT-THAP1 dystonia'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adult-onset focal or segmental isolated dystonias may involve different body areas and extend to contiguous regions, but progression to generalized dystonia is rare. Onset is usually after age 30 years. Most cases are sporadic without identifiable cause. Common <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> important types include (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cervical dystonia (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Cervical dystonia'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Adult-onset cranial-cervical dystonia (see <a href=\"#H58621651\" class=\"local\">'DYT-GNAL dystonia'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Blepharospasm (see <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Blepharospasm'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Oromandibular dystonia and facial dystonia (see <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Oromandibular dystonia and facial dystonia'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Spasmodic dysphonia (see <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Spasmodic dysphonia'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Arm dystonia (see <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Arm dystonia'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Task-specific or task-specific dystonia such as writer's dystonia (see <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Task-specific dystonia'</a> above and <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Writer's dystonia'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Combined dystonias are those in which dystonia is combined with other movement disorders, such as parkinsonism or myoclonus.

Some examples are (see <a href=\"#H58621160\" class=\"local\">'Combined dystonia'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Dopa-responsive dystonia (DRD), which manifests in most cases as a generalized dystonia with onset in early childhood. The most frequent form of DRD is autosomal dominant DYT-GCH1 dystonia with a mutation in the GCH1 gene (see <a href=\"#H3959000\" class=\"local\">'Dopa-responsive dystonia'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Other forms of dystonia-parkinsonism, which include Wilson disease, monogenic forms of early-onset parkinsonism (Parkin-, PINK1-, and DJ-1-associated parkinsonism), X-linked dystonia-parkinsonism (DYT-TAF1), rapid-onset dystonia-parkinsonism (DYT-ATP1A3), and the genetically heterogeneous syndrome of neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (see <a href=\"#H63656122\" class=\"local\">'Dystonia-parkinsonism'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Myoclonus-dystonia (DYT-SGCE), an autosomal dominant movement disorder characterized by alcohol-sensitive myoclonic jerks, primarily affecting the arms and axial muscles, combined with variable features of dystonia (see <a href=\"#H63656340\" class=\"local\">'Myoclonus-dystonia'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Paroxysmal dyskinesia with dystonia, which includes several rare genetic forms characterized by episodes of spontaneous or induced dyskinesia with dystonia (DYT-MR1, DYT-PRRT2, and DYT-SLC2A1) (see <a href=\"#H3960598\" class=\"local\">'Paroxysmal dyskinesia with dystonia'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of dystonia is mainly clinical. Expert observation by a movement disorder specialist is suggested to confirm the diagnosis of dystonia in cases where there is uncertainty or confusion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F70065\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70065 \">table 6</a>). Atypical presentations <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> suspicion for secondary etiologies should prompt further investigations. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with focal or generalized dystonia of unknown etiology, we recommend a trial of levodopa (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbidopa-and-levodopa-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbidopa-levodopa</a> <span class=\"nowrap\">25/100</span> mg three times daily, slowly increased to total levodopa doses of 600 to 1,000 mg daily) to confirm or exclude the diagnosis of DRD (see <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Levodopa trial'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with early-onset dystonia, or those with late onset who have an affected relative with early-onset dystonia, we suggest TOR1A genetic testing for DYT-TOR1A dystonia (see <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Genetic testing'</a> above)</p><p/><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/classification-and-evaluation-of-dystonia/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Albanese A, Bhatia K, Bressman SB, et al.
