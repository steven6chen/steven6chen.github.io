The level of benefit varies depending upon operator skill and the anatomic site. </p><p>Ultrasound-guided venous access is indicated in any patient for whom central vascular access via the internal jugular vein or femoral vein is necessary when equipment and operator expertise are available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-ultrasound-guided-venous-access/abstract/5,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,10</a>]. Static vein localization <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dynamic ultrasound guidance is also helpful for identifying or confirming a patent vein site prior to central vein catheter or peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) placement, or for establishing peripheral intravenous access in adults and children when difficulty is expected or when the traditional blind technique has failed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-ultrasound-guided-venous-access/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1232393924\"><span class=\"h2\">Central venous access</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based upon randomized trials, we recommend that when equipment and expertise are available, children and adults undergoing central venous access at internal jugular or femoral access sites have the procedure guided by dynamic ultrasound rather than using the landmark technique alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-ultrasound-guided-venous-access/abstract/5,6,13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,13-15</a>]. This recommendation is also supported by guidelines issued by safety advocacy organizations including the Agency for Healthcare Quality and Research, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE), and multiple professional societies, including the American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine, European Federation of Societies for Ultrasound in Medicine and Biology, American Society of Anesthesiologists Task Force on Venous Access, American Society of Echocardiography, and Society of Cardiovascular Anesthesiologists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-ultrasound-guided-venous-access/abstract/16-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-21</a>]. Ultrasound is also commonly used to place PICCs via the brachial or basilic vein in adults, children, and sedated neonates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-ultrasound-guided-venous-access/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. </p><p>When ultrasound is not available, central catheters are placed using techniques that rely on knowledge of anatomic landmarks, but even experienced clinicians are encouraged to learn ultrasound-guided techniques. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1232393281\"><span class=\"h3\">Internal jugular vein</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of ultrasound technology permits localization of the internal jugular vein and internal carotid artery during needle access and results in increased success rates for internal jugular vascular access in both adults and children, with lower rates of inadvertent arterial puncture and other complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-ultrasound-guided-venous-access/abstract/5,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,25,26</a>].</p><p>Support for the use of ultrasound for internal jugular cannulation is provided by the following studies: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A separate meta-analysis included seven randomized trials in 608 adults and three trials in 167 infants undergoing internal jugular cannulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-ultrasound-guided-venous-access/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Two-dimensional ultrasound guidance increased the success rate of catheter placement by 12 percent and success at first attempt by 57 percent, and reduced the amount of time needed for successful cannulation.

The trial judged to be at low risk of bias found a significantly higher success at first attempt for the ultrasound compared with the landmark technique (65 versus 45 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-ultrasound-guided-venous-access/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

Standard approaches (supraclavicular, infraclavicular) and, more recently, an axillary approach to the subclavian vein have been evaluated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-ultrasound-guided-venous-access/abstract/3,32-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,32-35</a>]. The available evidence suggests that an ultrasound-guided technique may not improve the success rate for subclavian line placement in adults and increases the length of time for the procedure compared with the landmark technique when the infraclavicular approach is used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-ultrasound-guided-venous-access/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, some studies suggest a reduction in adverse events when ultrasound is used and a reduction in the rate of failed catheterization when two-dimensional ultrasound is used. These results are consistent with studies demonstrating similar benefits for ultrasound guidance when obtaining jugular or femoral access. In the hands of experienced operators, the failure rate for the landmark technique at the subclavian site ranges from 9 to 13 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-ultrasound-guided-venous-access/abstract/25,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,33</a>]. </p><p>A systematic review identified 10 trials using ultrasound to guide subclavian catheter placement: six studies used dynamic ultrasound (n = 719), one used static ultrasound (n = 821), and three used Doppler ultrasound (n = 628) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-ultrasound-guided-venous-access/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. There were no significant differences in the overall rate of failure of catheterization or failure at first attempt when comparing ultrasound with the landmark technique, but the overall risk of complications was significantly reduced in the ultrasound group (odds ratio 0.53, 95% CI 0.41-0.69). In a subgroup analysis, the use of dynamic two-dimensional ultrasound during the procedure significantly decreased the rate of failed catheterization (risk ratio 0.24; 95% CI 0.06-0.92) and also reduced the incidence of inadvertent arterial puncture, pneumothorax, and hematoma formation. No significant differences were identified with respect to catheter malposition.</p><p>Ultrasound may have a role for subclavian line placement in small children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-ultrasound-guided-venous-access/abstract/5,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,25</a>]. A small observational study of 25 ultrasound-guided subclavian punctures found an initial success rate of 84 percent, which increased to 100 percent after two attempts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-ultrasound-guided-venous-access/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

Successful cannulation (reported in six trials) was more frequent with ultrasound guidance compared with no ultrasound guidance (79 versus 62 percent; odds ratio 2.42, 95% CI 1.25-4.68). There were no differences in time to successful cannulation (five trials) or number of percutaneous skin punctures (four trials). A separate systematic review that performed a pooled analysis of four trials in adults found a reduced number of attempts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-ultrasound-guided-venous-access/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>Based upon these findings, we suggest that, when equipment and operator expertise are available, adults with difficult vascular access should undergo peripheral intravenous catheter placement using dynamic ultrasound guidance rather than a blind technique.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1232393436\"><span class=\"h3\">Use in children</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In young children, static ultrasound can be used to localize potential peripheral veins for cannulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-ultrasound-guided-venous-access/abstract/12,45-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,45-47</a>]. Dynamic ultrasound can be hampered by the small size of the child's extremity and lack of cooperation during the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-ultrasound-guided-venous-access/abstract/45,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,48</a>]. In one trial, 40 children were randomly assigned to undergo peripheral access with or without ultrasound guidance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-ultrasound-guided-venous-access/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. In the ultrasound-guided group, the median time to cannulation was significantly shorter (63.5 versus 420.5 seconds), and the median number of punctures was less (1 versus 2.5). However, in a trial that randomly assigned 418 children to peripheral intravenous catheter placement with a standard approach, an ultrasound-guided technique, or the use of near-infrared vascular imaging, the rate of successful first attempt did not differ significantly between the groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-ultrasound-guided-venous-access/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1382363008\"><span class=\"h2\">Intraosseous access</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultrasound has also been used to confirm intraosseous (IO) needle placement in adults. The efficacy of this approach was illustrated in a human cadaver study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-ultrasound-guided-venous-access/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Detection of Doppler flow within the marrow cavity when the ultrasound probe was placed cephalad to the IO site correctly predicted appropriate IO placement in all instances and was superior to visualizing drops from the intravenous (IV) fluid bag into the IV tubing reservoir.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1232394188\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTRAINDICATIONS AND PRECAUTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultrasound-guided access can be difficult and time consuming and should <strong>not</strong> supplant intraosseous access in a life-threatening situation when peripheral or central access by landmark techniques is not rapidly successful.

Thus, vascular structures in morbidly obese patients are harder to localize and access. Other contraindications or precautions are the same as for traditional vascular access procedures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F71716\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71716 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-central-venous-access#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of central venous access&quot;, section on 'Relative contraindications'</a>.)</p><p>There are several settings in which ultrasound identification of venous structures may be difficult:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The subclavian vein is more difficult to localize than the femoral or internal jugular vein because of the proximity of the clavicle.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Moderate-to-severe volume depletion may interfere with ultrasound localization of venous structures. Doppler ultrasound depends upon blood flow and may not adequately display the vein in states of severe shock or low pulse pressure.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1232394654\"><span class=\"h1\">ULTRASOUND EQUIPMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The level of sophistication of ultrasound equipment varies widely, but even the most basic models are usually sufficient for the purposes of ultrasound-guided venous access.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1232394739\"><span class=\"h2\">Modes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Requirements for vessel identification and localization for cannulation include B-mode and Doppler mode. B-mode (brightness mode) refers to the standard two-dimensional grayscale image of the tissue, while Doppler mode relies on the flow of blood either toward or away from the transducer to provide velocity information. </p><p>Doppler ultrasound can provide velocity information presented as colors superimposed on a grayscale image (color Doppler). Alternatively, velocities can be presented graphically on a timeline (spectral or pulsed Doppler). Duplex Doppler refers to the simultaneous display of a color Doppler image and the spectral waveform. The clinician should keep in mind that both color and spectral Doppler are insensitive when the vessel is oriented 90 degrees to the transducer, since the flow toward the transducer and away from the transducer are equal. If the operator encounters difficulty identifying flow with color or spectral Doppler, tilting the probe so that the vessel is not horizontally oriented in the image may help achieve a more advantageous angle. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1232394747\"><span class=\"h2\">Transducers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Proper probe selection is critical for achieving high image quality. For vascular access, a high-frequency (5 to 12 MHz) linear transducer is usually best (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F59421\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59421 \">picture 1</a>). </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A high-frequency linear transducer (5 to 12 MHz) is most commonly used (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F59421\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59421 \">picture 1</a>). The high frequency permits greater resolution of tissues close to the skin surface. A linear (flat) shape is ideal for imaging veins because it allows the operator to apply even compression when distinguishing arteries from veins (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F72691\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef72691 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F61917\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef61917 \">image 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A curved transducer with a lower frequency range may be useful in obese patients for increased penetration of tissues (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F59421\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59421 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A &quot;hockey-stick&quot; 15 MHz transducer, a type of linear transducer, is appropriate for tight locations such as the neck in a small child (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F59421\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59421 \">picture 1</a>). This very high-resolution transducer also allows the greatest degree of needle and vein visibility. It is ideally suited for accessing small veins in infants and children but can also be successfully used in normal weight adults. It is limited by its shallow penetration, which might make it unsuitable for large or obese adults.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">ULTRASOUND ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The anatomic landmarks for traditional venous access may be used as a starting point for ultrasound probe placement. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placement-of-jugular-venous-catheters#H85542669\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placement of jugular venous catheters&quot;, section on 'Approaches to the internal jugular vein'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placement-of-subclavian-venous-catheters#H662981166\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placement of subclavian venous catheters&quot;, section on 'Approaches to the subclavian vein'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vascular-venous-access-for-pediatric-resuscitation-and-other-pediatric-emergencies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vascular (venous) access for pediatric resuscitation and other pediatric emergencies&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placement-of-femoral-venous-catheters#H2262641948\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placement of femoral venous catheters&quot;, section on 'Needle placement'</a>.)</p><p>When seen with ultrasound, all vessels should be anechoic (black) tubular structures, while the surrounding tissues will be some level of gray. Veins are distinguished from arteries on ultrasound because they have thinner walls, are more easily compressed, may have visible valves, and lack arterial pulsations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F72691\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef72691 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F61917\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef61917 \">image 2</a>). In addition, veins usually distend with maneuvers that impede or augment venous return, such as application of limb tourniquets, the Valsalva maneuver, and putting the patient in the Trendelenburg position. In contrast, the arterial diameter will remain the same during these maneuvers. If the artery overlies the vein, repositioning the patient may help. If vein remains obscured, another site may need to be used. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placement-of-jugular-venous-catheters#H105076091\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placement of jugular venous catheters&quot;, section on 'Positioning'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placement-of-subclavian-venous-catheters#H58338655\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placement of subclavian venous catheters&quot;, section on 'Positioning'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=placement-of-femoral-venous-catheters#H58340216\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Placement of femoral venous catheters&quot;, section on 'Positioning'</a>.) </p><p>If the grayscale appearance of a vessel is not convincingly a vein based upon the above criteria, Doppler ultrasound can provide added reassurance. Arterial flow is generally clearly pulsatile with a sharp &quot;whoosh&quot; corresponding to systole. Conversely, venous flow produces a steadier &quot;hum&quot; that often becomes more pulsatile the closer the vein is to the heart. With color Doppler, be aware that the red and blue colors are arbitrary, indicating only the direction of flow relative to the transducer location, not the type of vessel. By convention, red is defined as flow toward the transducer and blue represents flow away from the transducer, but this orientation can be switched using the control panel on the ultrasound machine or reversing the orientation of the probe.</p><p>Spectral Doppler refers to the waveform depiction of flow (see <a href=\"#H1232394739\" class=\"local\">'Modes'</a> above), which can also be helpful in distinguishing artery from vein. Similar to the sound produced by the ultrasound machine, arteries produce a waveform with a sharp upstroke (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F79020\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef79020 \">waveform 1</a>). Veins, on the other hand, produce an undulating waveform that shows mild variation with the respiratory and cardiac cycles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54834\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef54834 \">waveform 2</a>). The degree of variation will depend upon the depth of breathing as well as the proximity of the vein to the right atrium. It is also useful to note the presence of a monophasic (flat) venous waveform. This is often an indication of an unrecognized outflow stenosis or occlusion, which might present an obstacle to successful passage of the catheter into the central circulation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13563724\"><span class=\"h2\">Probe orientation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important that the operator orient the probe properly, since having the probe oriented backwards may lead to complications. By convention, structures beneath the left aspect of the ultrasound probe marker (denoted by a light or a notch on the side of the probe) are always displayed on the left side of the imaging screen. Probes usually have markings to assist proper probe orientation, but these markings may be obscured. Movement of the probe left or right while observing the image should help confirm the proper orientation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-ultrasound-guided-venous-access/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>When working from beside the patient, as for femoral vein central line or peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) insertion, this marker should be oriented to the patient's right on transverse views. Using this orientation, the patient's right will be displayed on the left-hand side of the ultrasound monitor, and the operator's needle movements in the transverse view will make intuitive sense. Any movement of the needle to the patient's right (operator's left) will be displayed to the left on the monitor.</p><p>By contrast, when working from the head of the bed, as is often done for internal jugular vein access, the probe marker should be oriented toward the operator's left (also the patient's left) for both right and left internal jugular vein access. This orientation ensures that the neck anatomy on the ultrasound monitor corresponds directly to the probe location and movement on the patient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1486558433\"><span class=\"h2\">Views</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinician can use either the transverse <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> longitudinal views to localize and cannulate the selected vein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-ultrasound-guided-venous-access/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>]. Whether one view is preferred over another is not well studied and likely depends upon the vein being cannulated and the patient's surface anatomy. </p><p>A transverse (short-axis) view is useful for access to vessels near the skin surface, such as the internal jugular vein. For deeper vessels, such as the common femoral vein, a combination of views can be used, starting with a longitudinal view to identify the vessel and initially advance the needle, followed by rotating to the transverse view to complete cannulation. Imaging the vessel in two directions may reduce the potential for damage to surrounding tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-ultrasound-guided-venous-access/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1486558440\"><span class=\"h3\">Transverse (short axis) view</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To obtain the transverse view, place the probe at a 90 degree angle to the course of the vein. The vessels appear in cross-section in this view. Veins are generally oval shaped with thin walls that are more easily compressed with light pressure, while arteries are generally circular with thicker walls and less easily compressed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F72691\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef72691 \">image 1</a>). Using the transverse view, the needle position is adjusted to ensure vessel entry at the 12 o'clock position. This technique minimizes the risk of accessing the lateral aspect of the vessel, which may be associated with more difficult hemostasis after catheter removal.</p><p>Vein cannulation with the transverse view is easier for two reasons. First, distinguishing the vein from an adjacent artery with compression technique is best performed with transverse orientation of the probe. The operator can slide off axis from the vessel during compression with a long axis approach, rather than truly compressing the vessel. Second, the transverse approach allows the operator to easily correct the trajectory of the needle during insertion through the tissues prior to venipuncture. The time to successful cannulation may be shorter with the transverse technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-ultrasound-guided-venous-access/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. However, for inexperienced operators, the needle tip is less easily seen with the transverse approach than with the longitudinal approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-ultrasound-guided-venous-access/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1486558447\" class=\"local\">'Longitudinal (long axis) view'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1486558447\"><span class=\"h3\">Longitudinal (long axis) view</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Before attempting the longitudinal view, the clinician should identify the location of the vein using the transverse view. The probe should then be rotated 90 degrees so that its long axis is parallel to the course of the vein (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54834\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef54834 \">waveform 2</a>). This view typically permits direct observation of needle penetration into the vein and passage of the J-wire (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F50251\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef50251 \">image 3</a>). In a simulated model of ultrasound-guided vascular access, the needle tip was seen in 24 of 39 cannulations using the longitudinal view [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-ultrasound-guided-venous-access/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p>A potentially important limitation is that the longitudinal view may be technically more difficult to perform and to maintain the center of the vessel in view during vascular access procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-ultrasound-guided-venous-access/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>Needle guidance systems may be used to help facilitate the longitudinal approach. These systems typically use a sterile plastic guide for the needle that snaps onto the probe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-ultrasound-guided-venous-access/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. The apparatus snaps apart after the target is reached, freeing the needle. One study of anesthesia residents showed that the use of a needle guidance system significantly increased needle tip visibility compared with the longitudinal free-hand technique or transverse technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-ultrasound-guided-venous-access/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. However, the number of needle sticks and needle redirections did not differ.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1232389864\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT PREPARATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For ultrasound-guided venous access, preparatory steps (including use of sterile technique) are the same as with any vascular access procedure, with the added step of ultrasound equipment preparation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-ultrasound-guided-venous-access/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].

Recognizing the importance of this patient safety goal, many hospitals have made this issue an organizational priority and have established protocols for patient preparation, dressings, and maintenance of central venous catheters. All operators should be familiar with their institutional-specific guidelines prior to placing central lines. Refer to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website for their checklist, which can serve as an example of the key elements that should be included in a central venous catheter placement policy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-ultrasound-guided-venous-access/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p>Prior to the placement of central catheters, preprocedure ultrasound imaging should evaluate vein patency in those who have a history of prior deep vein thrombosis in the region of the proposed access site. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=catheter-related-upper-extremity-venous-thrombosis#H37\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Catheter-related upper extremity venous thrombosis&quot;, section on 'Summary and recommendations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">ULTRASOUND MACHINE PREPARATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinicians should gain familiarity with the specific functions of the ultrasound machine in use at their own institution. The following are the typical steps involved in using the ultrasound:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Turn on and warm up the ultrasound machine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Enter patient data.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Choose the appropriate examination preset, which is critical.

Modify the position of the patient or route of access depending upon the ultrasound findings. Adjust the image parameters, as needed, including:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Gain, which refers to the brightness of the grayscale image, analogous to volume on a radio.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Depth, which refers to the depth of tissue included in the field of view. An appropriate depth includes the vein to be cannulated and a small amount of deeper tissue (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F81876\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef81876 \">image 4</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Focal zone, which refers to the depth level at which the sounds waves will be most tightly focused and will produce the best image resolution.

Color Doppler ultrasound can be turned on with a single button, and its parameters can be adjusted. If an appropriate preset is chosen, probably only the color gain will need to be adjusted. Spectral Doppler is also activated with a single button. The operator needs to steer the gate (the small cross-hatched area used to obtain the waveform) over the vessel by moving the trackball slowly back and forth, analogous to moving the cursor on a computer screen.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1232392861\"><span class=\"h1\">ULTRASOUND-GUIDED TECHNIQUES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultrasound can be used to guide placement of central venous catheters or peripheral intravenous catheters. Depending upon the available equipment, static or dynamic ultrasound can be used, but dynamic ultrasound is preferred for guiding central venous access. In either case, the use of an echogenic needle improves the ability to see the needle within the tissues during ultrasound-guided procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-ultrasound-guided-venous-access/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>].</p><p>Static ultrasound can be used to identify the target vein, confirm its patency, and mark its position just prior to access. Patients with a prior history of central catheter placement, prior central vein thrombosis, and those at risk for pneumothorax (thin or cachectic) or bleeding (coagulopathy) may benefit from a formal preprocedure duplex (in the vascular lab by a vascular technician) to assess vein patency and anatomic relationships [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/principles-of-ultrasound-guided-venous-access/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Less experienced operators may wish to have an assistant localize and maintain the view of the vein. </p><p>When using ultrasound for real-time monitoring during catheter placement (as opposed to localization and skin marking prior to catheter placement), take steps to ensure the sterility of the ultrasound probe. Commercially available sterile plastic sleeves are available for this purpose. Alternatively, a sterile glove or sterile plastic drape can be wrapped around the probe. To prepare the probe for sterile use:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Apply ultrasound gel to the head of the probe.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Place the probe into the sterile covering or sleeve.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Force any air out. Air bubbles trapped in the probe cover may lead to poor image quality.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Secure the sterile cover with a rubber band. A snug fit of the cover over the transducer is desirable. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Squeeze any excess gel up the sleeve, above the level of the rubber band. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Apply additional sterile conductive medium, such as sterile lubricant gel or povidone-iodine, between the wrapped probe and the surface of the skin.</p><p/><p>Once the vein site has been prepared and draped, the following steps should be performed in sequence for dynamic ultrasound-guided venous access.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Center the target vein on the ultrasound screen (transverse view) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54501\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54501 \">picture 2</a>), or obtain a longitudinal view using care to distinguish veins from arteries (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F72691\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef72691 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F61917\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef61917 \">image 2</a>).
