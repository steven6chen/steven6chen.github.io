Fever may be the first manifestation of a life-threatening infection, particularly during periods of neutropenia. Febrile episodes occur in approximately one-third of neutropenic episodes in children with chemotherapy-induced neutropenia or after hematopoietic cell transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-children-with-chemotherapy-induced-neutropenia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The approximate rate of occurrence is 0.76 episodes per every 30 days of neutropenia.</p><p>The demonstration of markedly reduced infection-related morbidity and mortality with the empiric use of broad-spectrum antibiotics during periods of febrile neutropenia was a major advance in the field of oncology in the 1970s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-children-with-chemotherapy-induced-neutropenia/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Subsequent studies identified factors associated with a higher risk of bacterial infection and facilitated a more tailored approach to empiric therapy.</p><p>Because of important differences between oncology and hematology patients with neutropenia, fever in the pediatric cancer patient during periods of therapy-induced neutropenia are reviewed here. The types of infections and management of fever in the child with other forms of neutropenia are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-of-infection-in-children-with-fever-and-non-chemotherapy-induced-neutropenia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk of infection in children with fever and non-chemotherapy-induced neutropenia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-fever-in-children-with-non-chemotherapy-induced-neutropenia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of fever in children with non-chemotherapy-induced neutropenia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Fever in adult cancer patients with neutropenia is discussed separately.

The ANC is calculated using the following formula:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ANC = total white blood cell count <span class=\"nowrap\">(cells/microL)</span> x (percent neutrophils + percent bands) &divide; 100</p></div></div><p/><p>For purposes of management of the febrile pediatric cancer patient, neutropenia is defined as an ANC &lt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> or an ANC that is expected to decrease to &lt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> during the next 48 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-children-with-chemotherapy-induced-neutropenia/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>].</p><p>The relative risk of infection is related to both the degree and duration of neutropenia. An increased risk becomes apparent at an ANC &lt;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL,</span> is greater at an ANC &le;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> and greatest at an ANC &le;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> (profound neutropenia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-children-with-chemotherapy-induced-neutropenia/abstract/2,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8</a>]. Patients with neutropenia projected to last for more than seven days also are at a higher risk of infection than are those with neutropenia of shorter duration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-children-with-chemotherapy-induced-neutropenia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Patients with hematologic malignancies that impair phagocytosis and killing of pathogens also are at increased risk of infection even if their ANC is normal (&quot;functional neutropenia&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-children-with-chemotherapy-induced-neutropenia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Other factors that predispose to infection in association with chemotherapy include breakdown of skin and mucosal barriers, such as mucositis following <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">methotrexate</a> treatment, and altered humoral and cellular immunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-children-with-chemotherapy-induced-neutropenia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Infections in pediatric cancer patients are more common during periods of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia, but they also can occur in the absence of neutropenia. For example, 90 percent of pediatric oncology patients have central venous catheters, which may be a source of infection whether or not the child is neutropenic. Because children are not always able to convey localized complaints, children with cancer who develop fever must be evaluated for infections regardless of the ANC.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Fever</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fever generally is defined as a single oral temperature &ge;38.3&deg;C (101&deg;F) in neutropenic patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-children-with-chemotherapy-induced-neutropenia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. A temperature &ge;38&deg;C (100.4&deg;F) for longer than one hour or two elevations &gt;38&deg;C (100.4&deg;F) during a 12-hour period are additional definitions of fever that may be used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-children-with-chemotherapy-induced-neutropenia/abstract/6,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,12</a>].</p><p>Oral temperature measurements are preferred, although an axillary temperature is acceptable if the patient is unable to use an oral thermometer. Generally, no conversion is made between axillary and oral temperatures. However, more conservative guidelines suggest that adding 0.5&deg;F (0.3&deg;C) to the axillary temperature reading may be warranted. Electronic thermometers are now available with oral, axillary, and rectal modes that automatically adjust for the location of the measure such that no manipulation of the displayed temperature is necessary. Package inserts of electronic thermometers should be read to determine if this feature is available. Rectal temperature measurement should be avoided in neutropenic patients because of associated risks of mucosal trauma and bacteremia.</p><p>Fever often is the sole sign of occult infection in the neutropenic host [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-children-with-chemotherapy-induced-neutropenia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, this sign may be absent in some infected patients who instead may be hypothermic, hypotensive, listless, or confused. Thus, infection must be considered and treated empirically if any signs of clinical deterioration are present in a neutropenic child, regardless of the recorded temperature. Similarly, infected children who are receiving glucocorticoids may present with a lower <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> intermittent temperature elevation &ndash; or may be afebrile.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H165385902\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk category</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with fever and neutropenia can be divided into high- and low-risk categories based upon presenting signs and symptoms, counts, underlying cancer, type of therapy and the anticipated length of neutropenia, and medical comorbidities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-children-with-chemotherapy-induced-neutropenia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, there is no currently agreed-upon risk stratification specifically for children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-children-with-chemotherapy-induced-neutropenia/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H165385930\"><span class=\"h3\">High-risk</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>High-risk patients have an increased risk of severe infection.

No clinical or microbiologic evidence of infection will be established in the remainder. Bacteremia is the most common form of documented infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-children-with-chemotherapy-induced-neutropenia/abstract/2,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,18</a>]. Other sites of infection include the gastrointestinal tract, with oral or intestinal mucositis or diarrhea caused by organisms such as <em>Clostridium difficile</em> and <em>Salmonella</em> spp; upper and lower respiratory tract; urinary tract; and skin and soft tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-children-with-chemotherapy-induced-neutropenia/abstract/1,16,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,16,20</a>].</p><p>Rates of bacteremia vary greatly (range approximately 20 to 50 percent) depending upon the institution and underlying malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-children-with-chemotherapy-induced-neutropenia/abstract/17,18,21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18,21-24</a>].</p><p>Both gram-positive and gram-negative organisms are isolated frequently from the blood in febrile neutropenic children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-children-with-chemotherapy-induced-neutropenia/abstract/2,18,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,18,25</a>]. The frequency of pathogenic organisms varies from institution to institution. In general, there is a global shift toward a dominance of gram-positive organisms due to the ubiquitous use of prophylactic antimicrobials and indwelling venous catheters. The most common gram-positive pathogens are coagulase-negative staphylococci, viridans streptococci, and <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (including methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-children-with-chemotherapy-induced-neutropenia/abstract/2,18,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,18,23</a>]. Aerobic gram-negative bacilli account for approximately one-third to one-half of bacteremic episodes, with <em>Escherichia coli</em>, <em>Klebsiella</em> spp, <em>Pseudomonas</em> spp, <em>Acinetobacter</em> spp, and <em>Enterobacter</em> spp among the more common isolates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-children-with-chemotherapy-induced-neutropenia/abstract/2,18,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,18,23</a>].</p><p>Fungi, typically <em>Candida</em> spp, are more likely to be recovered after prolonged courses of broad-spectrum antibiotics but occasionally may be the primary pathogen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-children-with-chemotherapy-induced-neutropenia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Other potential fungal organisms include <em>Aspergillus</em> spp, <em>Zygomycetes</em>, and <em>Cryptococcus</em> spp [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-children-with-chemotherapy-induced-neutropenia/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. <em>Fusarium</em> spp also have been increasingly recognized in these hosts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-children-with-chemotherapy-induced-neutropenia/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The increasing use of antifungal prophylaxis is likely to shift the distribution of fungal isolates away from <em>Candida</em> spp and toward mold infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-children-with-chemotherapy-induced-neutropenia/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

Blood cultures should be taken from each lumen of the central line when such access is available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-children-with-chemotherapy-induced-neutropenia/abstract/14,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,37</a>]. Opinions vary as to whether blood should be cultured from peripheral sites, as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-children-with-chemotherapy-induced-neutropenia/abstract/38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-40</a>]. The rationale for culturing blood from both peripheral and central sites is to differentiate a catheter-related infection from a bacteremia from another source and to guide decisions about whether to retain or remove a catheter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-children-with-chemotherapy-induced-neutropenia/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. A catheter-related bloodstream infection can be diagnosed if the colony count of microbes in blood obtained via the catheter hub is at least threefold greater than that obtained from the peripheral blood or if the culture obtained via the catheter hub becomes positive at least two hours before the peripheral blood when using a continuous read system. However, treatment recommendations for central catheter-related infections and for bacteremias from other sources are similar, and many institutions do not recommend the routine culturing of blood from peripheral sites in addition to central sites even though peripheral cultures are necessary to confirm a diagnosis of catheter-related bloodstream infection.</p><p>Obtaining more than one blood culture is helpful in the interpretation of blood culture results. If coagulase-negative staphylococci are isolated from two or more blood cultures, true bacteremia is more likely than contamination of the specimen, which may be reflected by a single positive blood culture. When obtaining blood from a central venous catheter, the importance of sampling all lumens is supported by studies in which 32 to 43 percent of positive cultures from double lumen catheters were positive from only one of multiple lumens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-children-with-chemotherapy-induced-neutropenia/abstract/38,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,42</a>].</p><p>If the child remains febrile after initiation of empiric antibiotic therapy, daily blood cultures should be obtained for the next two days, after which blood cultures should be repeated when there is a change in clinical status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fever-in-children-with-chemotherapy-induced-neutropenia/abstract/6,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,43</a>].

Fever may be the first manifestation of a life-threatening infection, particularly during periods of neutropenia. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neutropenia, for the purpose of management of the febrile pediatric cancer patient, is defined as an absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of &lt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> or an ANC that is expected to decrease to &lt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span> during the next 48 hours. In neutropenic patients, fever is defined as a single oral temperature &ge;38.3&deg;C (101&deg;F), a temperature &ge;38&deg;C (100.4&deg;F) for longer than one hour, or two elevations &gt;38&deg;C (100.4&deg;F) during a 12-hour period. (See <a href=\"#H23804302\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with fever and neutropenia can be categorized as high- or low-risk for severe infection based upon presenting signs and symptoms, ANC, underlying cancer, type of therapy, and medical comorbidities. High-risk is defined by neutropenia (ANC &lt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL)</span> anticipated to last &gt;7 days; hepatic or renal insufficiency; or comorbid medical problems. Low-risk is defined by neutropenia expected to resolve within 7 days; stable and adequate hepatic and renal function; and no active comorbidities. (See <a href=\"#H165385902\" class=\"local\">'Risk category'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Between 10 and 40 percent of children with fever and chemotherapy-induced neutropenia have a documented infection.

Prompt initiation (ie, as soon as possible, but definitively within 60 minutes of presentation) of empiric therapy can be life-saving, so rapid (but thorough) evaluation is critical.
