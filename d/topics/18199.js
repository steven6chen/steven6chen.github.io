Detailed analyses of large databases of patients presenting with newly diagnosed cutaneous melanoma have allowed the correlation of pathologic and clinical parameters with long-term outcome.</p><p>This information has been incorporated into a staging system that was developed by the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) in collaboration with the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC). This system relies upon assessments of the primary tumor (T), regional lymph nodes (N), and distant metastatic sites (M). </p><p>The eighth edition of the AJCC staging system is based upon 43,792 patients diagnosed with stage I to III melanoma since 1998 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110663\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110663 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-node-metastasis-tnm-staging-system-and-other-prognostic-factors-in-cutaneous-melanoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The results from this database are prognostic rather than predictive and antedate a number of important advances in treatment that are likely to have a major impact on outcomes for both rates of relapse and death. Staging markers that not only define risk of recurrence but also predict potential benefit from treatment will need to be developed.</p><p>The eighth edition AJCC melanoma staging system is presented here, along with key changes from the seventh edition. Other significant prognostic factors for cutaneous melanoma are also presented here. The clinical approach to staging a newly diagnosed patient is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=staging-work-up-and-surveillance-after-treatment-of-melanoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Staging work-up and surveillance after treatment of melanoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EIGHTH EDITION AJCC TNM STAGING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The eighth edition of the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system is based upon an evaluation of the primary tumor, the regional lymph nodes and lymphatic drainage, and the presence or absence of distant metastases. The information from TNM staging is then combined to classify patients into AJCC prognostic stage groups. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Prognostic stage group'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary tumor (T)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The eighth edition AJCC staging system uses the same parameters that were used in the seventh edition AJCC staging system except that mitotic rate has been removed as a staging criterion for T1 tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-node-metastasis-tnm-staging-system-and-other-prognostic-factors-in-cutaneous-melanoma/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. However, mitotic rate remains an important prognostic factor that should be recorded for all patients with T1 to T4 primary cutaneous melanoma.</p><p>Tumor thickness measured in mm (Breslow thickness) is a continuous variable that is associated with risk. Staging systems subdivide tumor thickness integer levels primarily for convenience.</p><p>The eighth edition AJCC staging system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110663\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110663 \">table 1</a>) defines T stage as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-node-metastasis-tnm-staging-system-and-other-prognostic-factors-in-cutaneous-melanoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tumor thickness is recorded to the nearest 0.1 mm rather than 0.01 mm (as was done in the seventh edition), even when tumor thickness is measured to the nearest 0.01 mm. For example, a tumor measuring 0.75 mm thick would be rounded to 0.8 mm, and one measuring 0.74 mm thick would be rounded to 0.7 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-node-metastasis-tnm-staging-system-and-other-prognostic-factors-in-cutaneous-melanoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>T0 melanomas have an unknown or completely regressed primary tumor. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tis is used for melanoma in situ.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TX tumors are those in which the tumor thickness cannot be assessed (for example, if the diagnosis was established by curettage).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>T1 is &le;1 mm, with T1a &lt;0.8 mm without ulceration, and T1b &lt;0.8 mm with ulceration or 0.8 to 1.0 mm with or without ulceration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>T2 is &gt;1.0 to 2.0 mm, which is subdivided into T2a or T2b based upon the absence or presence of ulceration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>T3 is &gt;2.0 to 4.0 mm, which is subdivided into T3a or T3b based upon the absence or presence of ulceration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>T4 is &gt;4.0 mm, which is subdivided into T4a or T4b based upon the absence or presence of ulceration if ulceration status is known.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Tumor thickness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evaluation of the entire tumor from an excisional biopsy, rather than a wedge or punch biopsy, is recommended to ensure measurement of the thickest part of the lesion; a shave biopsy can compromise this evaluation and is therefore discouraged. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-surgical-management-of-melanoma-of-the-skin-and-unusual-sites#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial surgical management of melanoma of the skin and unusual sites&quot;, section on 'Initial biopsy'</a>.)</p><p>The maximal tumor thickness is measured at a right angle to the surface of the skin over the tumor mass. The upper reference point is the superficial aspect of the granular cell layer of the epidermis, or the base of the lesion if the tumor is ulcerated. The lower reference point is the deepest point of invasion and may be represented by &quot;detached&quot; cell clusters beneath the mass. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathologic-characteristics-of-melanoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathologic characteristics of melanoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The subdivision of T1 tumors based upon primary tumor thickness in the eighth edition is based upon an analysis of 7568 patients with T1N0 melanoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-node-metastasis-tnm-staging-system-and-other-prognostic-factors-in-cutaneous-melanoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In multivariate analysis, melanoma-specific survival was worse for patients with a melanoma &ge;0.8 mm thick compared with &lt;0.8 mm (hazard ratio [HR] 1.7). Melanoma-specific survival was also worse for those with ulceration compared with those with nonulcerated melanoma (HR 2.6). Mitotic rate (as a dichotomous variable comparing &lt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mitosis/mm<sup>2</sup></span> with &ge;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mitosis/mm<sup>2</sup>,</span> as was incorporated as a T1 subcategory criterion in the seventh edition) was not an independent factor on multivariate analysis in these T1 melanoma patients (HR 0.85, p = 0.57). The distinction using the 0.8 mm threshold was also predictive of positivity on sentinel lymph node biopsy; less than 5 percent of those with a melanoma 0.8 mm had a positive sentinel lymph node biopsy, compared with 5 to 12 percent in those with melanoma 0.8 to 1.0 mm thick.</p><p>Additional supportive data for the subdivision of T1 tumors come from two earlier studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a population-based prospective registry of 26,736 patients with thin melanomas, the overall melanoma-specific survival at 20 years was 96 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-node-metastasis-tnm-staging-system-and-other-prognostic-factors-in-cutaneous-melanoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The original cutoff described by Breslow (&lt;0.75 versus &gt;0.75 mm) showed a powerful separation in melanoma-specific survival: the melanoma-specific survival rates at 20 years for depths &lt;0.25, 0.25 to 0.49, 0.50 to 0.74, and 0.75 to 1 mm were 98.3, 98.1, 96.2, and 89.0 percent, respectively. In multivariate analysis, the most important factors associated with survival were tumor thickness (&ge;0.75 versus &lt;0.25 mm, HR 4.3, 95% CI 2.8-6.8) and age at diagnosis (&gt;65 versus &lt;25 years, HR 2.8, 95% CI 1.8-4.5).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another multicenter database series of thin melanoma in 2243 patients with a median follow-up of 10 years correlated unadjusted estimates of survival with clinicopathologic parameters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-node-metastasis-tnm-staging-system-and-other-prognostic-factors-in-cutaneous-melanoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This study confirmed the importance of Breslow thickness (12-year overall survival rates 97, 92, and 71 percent for melanomas &le;0.5, &gt;0.5 to &le;0.75, and &gt;0.75 to &le;1 mm, respectively). Other important prognostic factors negatively influencing 12-year overall survival included mitotic rate (95 versus 75 percent for &lt;1 versus &ge;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mitoses/mm<sup>2</sup>),</span> ulceration (58 percent with ulceration versus 95 percent without ulceration), regression &ge;50 percent (49 versus 95 percent for &ge;50 versus &lt;50 percent), lymphovascular invasion (66 versus 95 percent for present versus absent), and sentinel lymph node status (HR 2.97 positive versus negative).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1905949433\"><span class=\"h3\">Ulceration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ulceration is defined as the absence of an intact epithelium over the melanoma. Ulceration is an important prognostic factor of the primary tumor in the AJCC staging system; it is used to define patient subsets for each tumor thickness group. Outcomes in patients with ulcerated primary tumors are worse than in patients with primary melanomas of the same thickness but without ulceration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Mitotic rate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mitotic rate is a significant prognostic factor within all tumor thickness categories, and it should be assessed and recorded in all primary melanomas. The recommended approach to determining mitotic rate is described in detail in the eighth edition of the AJCC Cancer Staging Manual [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-node-metastasis-tnm-staging-system-and-other-prognostic-factors-in-cutaneous-melanoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In brief, the area of dermis containing the most mitoses (the &quot;hot spot&quot;) is identified. Once the hot spot is identified, mitoses in adjacent fields within a total area of 1 mm<sup>2</sup> are counted to determine the mitotic rate.</p><p>The tumor mitotic rate is <strong>not</strong> incorporated into the eighth edition AJCC melanoma staging system for the primary tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-node-metastasis-tnm-staging-system-and-other-prognostic-factors-in-cutaneous-melanoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], unlike the seventh edition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-node-metastasis-tnm-staging-system-and-other-prognostic-factors-in-cutaneous-melanoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], where it was a criterion used in separating T1a and T1b tumors and was the second most important prognostic factor on multivariate analysis. In the analysis of the eighth edition database, univariate analysis for all T1 to T4 melanomas, melanoma-specific survival decreased progressively with increasing mitotic rate (from 97 to 99 percent for those with &lt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mitosis/mm<sup>2</span> </sup>to 77 percent for those with &ge;11 <span class=\"nowrap\">mitoses/mm<sup>2</sup>)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-node-metastasis-tnm-staging-system-and-other-prognostic-factors-in-cutaneous-melanoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Mitotic rate is continuing to be explored across its continuum for its role in the development of clinical tools and further changes in the staging system.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Regional involvement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The regional lymph nodes are a common site of metastatic disease from cutaneous melanoma, and regional lymph node spread has a major negative impact on long-term outcome. The clinical approach to the evaluation and management of regional lymph nodes is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-treatment-of-regional-lymph-nodes-in-melanoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and treatment of regional lymph nodes in melanoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">N category</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For staging purposes, all patients with histologic confirmation of nodal disease (including microsatellites, satellites, and in transit cutaneous <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> subcutaneous metastases) and without distant metastases are classified as stage III, regardless of the extent of nodal tumor burden. Although all patients with nodal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> non-nodal regional involvement are classified as stage III (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110663\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110663 \">table 1</a>), the prognostic implications vary depending upon the extent of the regional nodal and non-nodal involvement and other features of the primary tumor.</p><p>In the eighth edition AJCC melanoma staging system, regional lymph node involvement is classified as either clinically occult (found microscopically, usually based upon a sentinel lymph node biopsy) or clinically detected (on physical examination or by imaging). In the seventh edition AJCC melanoma staging system, regional lymph node involvement was classified as either microscopic or macroscopic, and those terms are no longer used.</p><p>In the eighth edition, the AJCC Melanoma Expert Panel continues to note that it is acceptable to classify node-positive metastases based solely on immunohistochemical staining, even for aggregates of a few cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-node-metastasis-tnm-staging-system-and-other-prognostic-factors-in-cutaneous-melanoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>In the eighth edition, microsatellites, satellites, and in transit cutaneous <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> subcutaneous metastases are formally stratified according to the number of tumor-involved lymph nodes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110663\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110663 \">table 1</a>). The distinction between satellite lesions and in transit metastases is not necessary from a clinical perspective since both represent a manifestation of intralymphatic disease. Satellite lesions and in transit metastases are grouped together and considered intralymphatic in the AJCC staging system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-node-metastasis-tnm-staging-system-and-other-prognostic-factors-in-cutaneous-melanoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>NX &ndash; Nodes not assessable (eg, sentinel node biopsy not performed, previously resected for other reasons).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>N0 &ndash; No regional metastases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>N1 &ndash; One involved lymph node, or in transit, satellite, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> microsatellite metastases with no tumor-involved nodes.

This is subdivided into N3a, N3b, and N3c depending upon the method of detection (clinical versus sentinel node biopsy), whether or not the nodes are matted, and the location of disease.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1515492846\"><span class=\"h2\">Distant metastases (M)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the eighth edition AJCC melanoma staging system, patients with distant metastases are subcategorized according to the site(s) of disease involvement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110663\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110663 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-node-metastasis-tnm-staging-system-and-other-prognostic-factors-in-cutaneous-melanoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Key changes compared with the seventh edition (2010) AJCC staging system include the use of serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level to further define each M category and the creation of a fourth category (M1d) based upon the presence of central nervous system metastases:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>M1a &ndash; Metastasis to distant skin, subcutaneous, or lymph node sites</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>M1b &ndash; Lung metastasis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>M1c &ndash; Metastasis to other visceral sites, excluding the central nervous system</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>M1d &ndash; Metastasis to the central nervous system, with or without involvement of other sites</p><p/><p>Serum LDH is an important independent prognostic factor in patients with disseminated melanoma, and an elevated serum LDH no longer automatically places the patient in the M1c category. In the eighth edition, each of the four M1 categories is subdivided with the notation (0) for non-elevated LDH and (1) for elevated LDH (eg, M1a(0) for a patient with distant skin involvement only and a non-elevated serum LDH).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSTIC STAGE GROUP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The eighth edition American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) melanoma staging system groups patients into four prognostic stage groups based upon the tumor (T), node (N), and metastases (M) parameters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-node-metastasis-tnm-staging-system-and-other-prognostic-factors-in-cutaneous-melanoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The eighth edition AJCC staging system distinguishes between clinical and pathologic staging.</p><p>The details of prognostic group staging are presented in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110664\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110664 \">table 2</a>). In brief:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage I &ndash; Stage I melanoma is limited to patients with low-risk primary melanomas (T1a, T1b, and T2a) without evidence of regional or distant metastases. Stage I is divided into stages IA and IB based upon the thickness of the primary tumor and the presence or absence of ulceration. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Primary tumor (T)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage II &ndash; Stage II disease includes primary tumors that are at higher risk of recurrence (T2b, T3a, T3b, T4a, and T4b) but do not have any evidence of lymphatic disease or distant metastases. Stage II is divided into stage IIA, IIB, and IIC depending upon tumor thickness and the presence or absence of ulceration. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Primary tumor (T)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage III &ndash; Stage III disease includes pathologically documented involvement of regional lymph nodes or the presence of in transit or satellite metastases (N1, N2, and N3). Patients with stage III disease are subclassified as having stage IIIA, IIIB, IIIC, or IIID disease depending upon the extent of lymphatic disease. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Regional involvement'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Unknown primary &ndash; Patients with isolated metastases identified in the lymph nodes, skin, or subcutaneous tissue who do not have an identifiable primary cutaneous melanoma (T0) are classified as pathologic stage III, assuming no other sites of disease are identified after an appropriate staging evaluation. Other sites of metastases from an unknown primary melanoma are classified as stage IV. (See <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Melanoma with unknown primary'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage IV &ndash; The presence of distant metastases defines stage IV disease (M1a to M1d). Central nervous system metastases (M1d) are associated with a particularly poor prognosis. There are no subgroups. (See <a href=\"#H1515492846\" class=\"local\">'Distant metastases (M)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">OTHER PROGNOSTIC FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of other clinical and pathologic parameters have been analyzed for their ability to predict long-term outcome in patients with cutaneous melanoma. Some of these factors are independent predictors of outcome but are not included in the American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Advancing age is associated with worse prognosis. Young patients, despite often having aggressive features associated with their tumor at the time of diagnosis, have a better prognosis, which suggests that their tumors may have a distinct biology.</p><p>Historical data on the impact of age were analyzed in 11,088 cases of stage I, II, and III melanoma in the AJCC Melanoma Staging Database used for the seventh edition AJCC melanoma staging system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-node-metastasis-tnm-staging-system-and-other-prognostic-factors-in-cutaneous-melanoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Contemporary studies are planned to further analyze the impact of age.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the entire study group, increasing age was associated with thicker primary tumors, increased mitotic rate, and an increasing percentage of tumors with ulceration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In younger patients, the most common location of the primary tumor was the trunk, with lesions of the head and neck the least common. In contrast, this pattern was reversed in those more than 80 years old, with the trunk the least common site and the head and neck the most common.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For the 10,233 patients with stage I or II disease (ie, node negative) at presentation, multivariate analysis found that age was an independent prognostic feature for survival, along with sex, primary tumor thickness, mitotic rate, ulceration of the primary tumor, and anatomic site.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the 775 patients with stage III disease, multivariate analysis identified four factors independently associated with survival: age, number of involved lymph nodes, presence of ulceration, and mitotic rate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Melanoma occurring in patients less than 20 years old tended to have more aggressive features in the primary tumor (high mitotic rate, ulceration) compared with that occurring in patients more than 20 years old, but survival outcomes were better than those seen with older patients. Patients more than 70 years old had the most aggressive findings in their primary tumor and have a worse overall survival.</p><p/><p>In another analysis of the seventh edition AJCC Melanoma Staging Database, the impact of age on sentinel lymph node involvement was studied in patients with clinical stage I or II disease who underwent sentinel lymph node biopsy as part of their initial evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-node-metastasis-tnm-staging-system-and-other-prognostic-factors-in-cutaneous-melanoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Increasing age was associated with decreasing incidence of sentinel lymph node involvement on multifactorial analysis; the highest incidence of sentinel lymph node involvement was 25.8 percent for those &lt;20 years of age, compared with 15.5 percent in those 80 years old.

Although many clinicians assumed that patients with nodular melanoma have a worse prognosis than those with superficial spreading tumors, multivariate analyses showed that the prognostic differences are accounted for by other factors (tumor thickness, ulceration) that are included in the AJCC staging system.

In multivariate analysis, de novo classification was an independent poor prognostic indicator in one of the two cohorts (HR 1.70, 95% CI 1.19-2.44, in one cohort and HR 1.27, 95% CI 0.93-1.75, in the other cohort).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other histopathologic findings &ndash; Other pathologic factors that have been associated with an improved prognosis in some reports include the presence of lymphocyte infiltration in a tumor and histologic evidence of regression in the primary tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-node-metastasis-tnm-staging-system-and-other-prognostic-factors-in-cutaneous-melanoma/abstract/17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20</a>].

Although desmoplastic melanomas may be locally aggressive, the prognosis appears to be better than with other advanced lesions. Although there may be prognostic differences for patients with desmoplastic melanoma, the same AJCC staging system is used in these cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-node-metastasis-tnm-staging-system-and-other-prognostic-factors-in-cutaneous-melanoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

In a series of 912 patients with a first primary melanoma diagnosed in 2000 and a median follow-up of 7.6 years, <em>BRAF</em> and <em>NRAS</em> mutations were identified in 30 and 13 percent of cases, respectively, and 57 percent were wild type [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-node-metastasis-tnm-staging-system-and-other-prognostic-factors-in-cutaneous-melanoma/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Compared with wild-type melanomas, those with <em>BRAF</em> and <em>NRAS</em> mutations were more likely to present with higher stage primary tumors.

All patients had undergone a complete lymph node dissection and were enrolled in an adjuvant trial. Patients whose samples were positive for two or more of these biomarkers had significantly worse distant metastasis-free survival and reduced recurrence-free survival (HRs 2.1 and 1.7, respectively).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h2\">Serum S-100 protein</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>S-100 protein is a dimeric protein whose biologic function is unknown; serum levels are correlated with clinical stage in patients with cutaneous melanoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tumor-node-metastasis-tnm-staging-system-and-other-prognostic-factors-in-cutaneous-melanoma/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].
