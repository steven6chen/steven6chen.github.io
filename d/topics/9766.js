It is estimated that 179,000 weight-loss surgeries were performed in 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-complications-of-bariatric-surgical-operations/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Of those, 42 percent were sleeve gastrectomy, 34 percent were gastric bypass, 14 percent were gastric band, and 1 percent were biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch. The remaining 6 percent were revisional procedures.</p><p>Complications following surgical treatment of severe obesity vary based upon the procedure performed and can be as high as 40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-complications-of-bariatric-surgical-operations/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Due to the high surgical volume, improving the safety of these operations has become a high priority, leading to the development of strict criteria for center accreditation, guidelines for safe and effective bariatric surgery, and careful monitoring of surgical outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-complications-of-bariatric-surgical-operations/abstract/4-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-8</a>]. </p><p>This topic will review the major late complications of bariatric surgery.

These will be discussed in the context of specific procedures below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS OF SPECIFIC BARIATRIC PROCEDURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h2\">Roux-en-Y gastric bypass</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RYGB involves the creation of a small gastric pouch and an anastomosis to a Roux limb of jejunum that bypasses 75 to 150 cm of small bowel, thereby restricting food and limiting absorption (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F52350\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52350 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-complications-of-bariatric-surgical-operations/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. This procedure is one of the most common weight-loss procedures performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-complications-of-bariatric-surgical-operations/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Complications of RYGB (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F79256\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79256 \">figure 2</a>) are diverse and vary based upon the specific technique. Some complications are relatively specific to the surgical approach (open versus laparoscopic). Certain complications are seen during the early postoperative periods, while others may present weeks to months following the surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h3\">Gastric remnant distension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gastric remnant distension is a rare but potentially lethal complication following gastric bypass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-complications-of-bariatric-surgical-operations/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. The gastric remnant is a blind pouch and may become distended if paralytic ileus or distal mechanical obstruction occurs postoperatively. Iatrogenic injury to vagal fibers along the lesser curvature may also contribute, possibly by leading to impaired emptying of the bypassed stomach. Progressive distension can ultimately lead to rupture, spillage of massive gastric contents, and subsequent severe peritonitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-complications-of-bariatric-surgical-operations/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The combination of the large size of inoculum (liters) and the injurious contents (acid, bile, pancreatic enzymes, and bacteria) makes this complication much more serious than leakage occurring at the gastrojejunostomy.</p><p>Clinical features include pain, hiccups, left upper quadrant tympany, shoulder pain, abdominal distension, tachycardia, or shortness of breath. Radiographic assessment may demonstrate a large gastric air bubble.</p><p>Treatment consists of emergent operative decompression with a gastrostomy tube or percutaneous gastrostomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-complications-of-bariatric-surgical-operations/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Immediate operative exploration and decompression are required if percutaneous drainage is not feasible, or if perforation is suspected. Although gastrostomy is not performed routinely by most surgeons at the initial gastric bypass operation, drainage of the gastric remnant can prevent this rare but sometimes fatal complication. Routine gastrostomy should be considered in the elderly, super-obese patients, patients with diabetic gastropathy and as part of revisional surgeries where gastric emptying may be delayed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h3\">Stomal stenosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stomal (anastomotic) stenosis has been described in 6 to 20 percent of patients who have undergone RYGB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-complications-of-bariatric-surgical-operations/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The etiology is uncertain, although tissue ischemia, marginal ulcer, or increased tension on the gastrojejunal anastomosis are believed to have a role. The stomal stenosis rate is higher in LRYGB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-complications-of-bariatric-surgical-operations/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>] and may be related to the use of the small-diameter (21-mm) circular staplers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laparoscopic-roux-en-y-gastric-bypass#H1349754501\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass&quot;, section on 'Other gastrojejunal (GJ) anastomosis techniques'</a>.)</p><p>A stomal stenosis manifests clinically when the anastomosis narrows to a diameter of &lt;10 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-complications-of-bariatric-surgical-operations/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Patients typically present several weeks after surgery with nausea, vomiting, dysphagia, gastroesophageal reflux, and eventually an inability to tolerate oral intake, including liquids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-complications-of-bariatric-surgical-operations/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. The diagnosis is usually established by endoscopy or with an upper gastrointestinal series.</p><p>Endoscopic balloon dilation is usually successful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-complications-of-bariatric-surgical-operations/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. The stoma should be dilated to a diameter of approximately 15 mm; further dilation to 20 mm may reduce the restrictive effect of RYGB. The gastrojejunal (GJ) anastomosis should not be dilated by &gt;3 to 4 mm at a time, and, as such, most patients will need two to three endoscopic procedures to reach a 15-mm anastomosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-complications-of-bariatric-surgical-operations/abstract/16,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,21</a>]. The complication rate for dilation is approximately 3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-complications-of-bariatric-surgical-operations/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Careful communication between the endoscopist and the surgeon regarding the details of the original operation is important to minimize the risk of endoscopic complications. </p><p>Patients with a chronic stenosis that is refractory to multiple dilations require a surgical revision of the GJ anastomosis after a delay of a few months to allow the gastric pouch to dilate. Fortunately, &lt;0.05 percent of patients require such a revision surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h3\">Marginal ulcers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Marginal ulcers have been reported in 0.6 to 16 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-complications-of-bariatric-surgical-operations/abstract/19,22-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,22-27</a>]. Marginal ulcers occur near the gastrojejunostomy and result from acid injuring the jejunum, or they can be associated with a gastrogastric [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-complications-of-bariatric-surgical-operations/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>] or, rarely, gastrocolic fistula [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-complications-of-bariatric-surgical-operations/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. </p><p>Causes of marginal ulcers include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-complications-of-bariatric-surgical-operations/abstract/23,24,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24,29,30</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Poor tissue perfusion due to tension or ischemia at the anastomosis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence of foreign material, such as staples or nonabsorbable suture</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excess acid exposure in the gastric pouch due to gastrogastric fistulas</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Helicobacter pylori </em>infection</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Smoking</p><p/><p>Patients with marginal ulcers can present with nausea, abdominal pain, gastrointestinal bleeding, stomal stenosis, or perforation. The diagnosis of a marginal ulcer is established by upper endoscopy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopy-in-patients-who-have-undergone-bariatric-surgery#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopy in patients who have undergone bariatric surgery&quot;, section on 'Marginal ulcers and acute gastrointestinal bleeding'</a>.)</p><p>Initial medical treatment consists of gastric acid suppression with a six-week course of proton pump inhibitors, with or without the addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sucralfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sucralfate</a>, followed by a repeat endoscopy to ensure healing. During the follow-up, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs should be discontinued, and patients should be encouraged to stop smoking. An upper gastrointestinal series or a computed tomography (CT) scan with oral contrast should be performed to rule out a gastrogastric fistula. </p><p>The prevalence of <em>H. pylori</em> infection in patients undergoing weight loss surgery is high, and a significant proportion of them have postoperative foregut symptoms. Observational studies have shown that patients with <em>H. pylori</em> colonization have a higher incidence of marginal ulcer formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-complications-of-bariatric-surgical-operations/abstract/30-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-34</a>]. Furthermore, in one study, preoperative testing and treatment of <em>H. pylori</em> significantly reduced the incidence of postoperative marginal ulcers (2.4 versus 6.8 percent in unscreened patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-complications-of-bariatric-surgical-operations/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indications-and-diagnostic-tests-for-helicobacter-pylori-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Indications and diagnostic tests for Helicobacter pylori infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-regimens-for-helicobacter-pylori\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment regimens for Helicobacter pylori&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although medical management of marginal ulcers is successful in 85 to 95 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-complications-of-bariatric-surgical-operations/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], surgery may be indicated if marginal ulcers perforate or if persistent pain or recurrent bleeding occurs despite maximal medical therapy. In stable patients, revision of the gastrojejunostomy with truncal vagotomy should be performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-complications-of-bariatric-surgical-operations/abstract/19,35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,35,36</a>]. In unstable patients, a Graham patch can be used to seal any perforation, the local area washed out, and a feeding tube placed. If stenosis occurs, the GJ anastomosis can be revised at a later time when the patient is more stable. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1598670830\"><span class=\"h3\">Candy cane Roux syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Candy cane Roux syndrome in patients who have undergone RYGB refers to an excessively long blind afferent Roux limb at the gastrojejunostomy causing postprandial pain often relieved by vomiting. It is believed that the blind afferent limb (&quot;candy cane&quot;) acts as an obstructed loop when filled with food (often preferentially), and the distention of the loop causes pain until the food either spills into the Roux limb or is vomited back out (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F113461\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113461 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-complications-of-bariatric-surgical-operations/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. </p><p>Patients have been reported presenting as early as three months and as late as 11 years after their initial RYGB, typically with symptoms of postprandial epigastric pain, nausea, vomiting, and reflux or food regurgitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-complications-of-bariatric-surgical-operations/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The diagnosis is confirmed by upper gastrointestinal contrast studies or endoscopy. On upper gastrointestinal series, the afferent limb fills before contrast spills into the Roux limb. On upper endoscopy, the afferent limb is usually the most direct outlet of the gastrojejunostomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-complications-of-bariatric-surgical-operations/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. </p><p>The treatment is revision bariatric surgery, most commonly laparoscopic resection of the afferent limb, which ranged in length from 3 to 22 cm in one study (mean of 7.6 cm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-complications-of-bariatric-surgical-operations/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Symptoms resolve after revision surgery in most patients. Surgeons should minimize the length of the blind afferent loop left at the time of initial RYGB to prevent candy cane Roux syndrome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31\"><span class=\"h3\">Cholelithiasis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cholelithiasis develops in as many as 38 percent of patients within six months of surgery, and up to 41 percent of such patients become symptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-complications-of-bariatric-surgical-operations/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Rapid weight loss can also contribute to the development of gallstones by increasing the lithogenicity of bile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-complications-of-bariatric-surgical-operations/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The high frequency of cholelithiasis can be reduced to as low as 2 percent with a six-month course of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ursodeoxycholic-acid-ursodiol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ursodeoxycholic acid</a> (UDCA; ursodiol, a synthetic bile salt) given prophylactically after weight-loss surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-complications-of-bariatric-surgical-operations/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-and-risk-factors-for-gallstones\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of and risk factors for gallstones&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The decision to perform a cholecystectomy at the time of bypass is controversial. Some surgeons recommend performing cholecystectomy at the time of bypass if a patient has symptomatic gallstones preoperatively. The surgical opinion about asymptomatic gallstones is more divided, and studies have failed to demonstrate a benefit for simultaneous cholecystectomy for incidental gallstones at the time of RYGB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-complications-of-bariatric-surgical-operations/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>].</p><p>Patients can also develop choledocholithiasis (stones in the common bile duct), which can be difficult to treat in the postoperative RYGB patient. Diagnosis of choledocholithiasis can be confirmed by ultrasound or magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP); however, endoscopic intervention and management can be difficult because of the relative inaccessibility to the duodenum due to the altered anatomy of the Roux-en-Y configuration. As a result, successful endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) with cannulation of the papilla is very difficult to perform [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-complications-of-bariatric-surgical-operations/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. Thus, treatment of choledocholithiasis may require surgery or transhepatic percutaneous access. Alternatively, placement of a gastrostomy tube into bypassed stomach at the time of gastric bypass, with the addition of a radiopaque marker to facilitate future percutaneous access to the gastric remnant has also been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-complications-of-bariatric-surgical-operations/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Surgical gastrostomy for pancreatobiliary and duodenal access following RYGB has been done with good results and may be an option when traditional endoscopic approaches are impossible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-complications-of-bariatric-surgical-operations/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32\"><span class=\"h3\">Ventral incisional hernia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ventral incisional hernias occur with a frequency of 0 to 1.8 percent in laparoscopic series and as high as 24 percent in open series, underscoring a clear advantage of the laparoscopic approach in this regard [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-complications-of-bariatric-surgical-operations/abstract/15,22,48-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,22,48-50</a>].</p><p>Incisional hernias present with an enlarging bulge, pain, or obstructive symptoms. Severe obesity is associated with increased intra-abdominal pressure and thus, a high risk of hernia development after a laparotomy. Many surgeons postpone a formal repair until significant weight loss occurs (&gt;1 year). Indications for early surgical repair include significant pain, bowel obstruction, and rapid enlargement of the hernia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-abdominal-wall-hernias-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of abdominal wall hernias in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33\"><span class=\"h3\">Internal hernias</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mesenteric defects that are created during a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass include (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F60840\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60840 \">figure 4</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A mesenteric defect at the jejunojejunostomy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A space between the transverse mesocolon and Roux-limb mesentery (ie, Petersen's defect)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A defect in the transverse mesocolon in patients with a retrocolic Roux-limb (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laparoscopic-roux-en-y-gastric-bypass#H4236633397\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass&quot;, section on 'Antecolic versus retrocolic passage of the Roux limb'</a>)</p><p/><p>Internal hernias have been described in 0 to 5 percent of patients after laparoscopic gastric bypass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-complications-of-bariatric-surgical-operations/abstract/15,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,22</a>]. To reduce the incidence of internal hernias, all mesenteric defects should be closed with nonabsorbable sutures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-complications-of-bariatric-surgical-operations/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In a multicenter trial, 2507 patients were randomly assigned to undergo laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass with or without mesenteric defect closure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-complications-of-bariatric-surgical-operations/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Compared with nonclosure, mesenteric closure significantly decreased the incidence of reoperation due to small bowel obstruction (6 versus 10 percent at three years) but increased early postoperative complications due to kinking of the jejunojejunostomy (4.3 versus 2.8 percent). In another study, the small bowel obstruction rate was reduced from 6 to 3 percent when all such defects were routinely closed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-complications-of-bariatric-surgical-operations/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. </p><p>The majority of internal hernias after laparoscopic gastric bypass occurred through the transverse mesocolon defect (44 of 66 in one study) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-complications-of-bariatric-surgical-operations/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. The use of an antecolic Roux limb can, in theory, reduce the risk of internal hernia formation by eliminating the transverse mesocolic defect. A 2016 meta-analysis found that the use of an antecolic Roux limb, as opposed to a retrocolic Roux limb, was associated with lower rates of postoperative internal hernia (1.3 versus 2.3 percent) and small bowel obstruction (1.4 versus 5.2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-complications-of-bariatric-surgical-operations/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. However, the two techniques have not been directly compared with each other in randomized trials. </p><p>Internal hernias can be difficult to detect radiographically because they are intermittent. Several studies have shown that the &quot;mesenteric swirl&quot; sign on CT scan is the best indicator of an internal hernia following gastric bypass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-complications-of-bariatric-surgical-operations/abstract/55-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">55-57</a>]. The mesenteric swirl sign shows a swirled appearance of mesenteric vessels or fat at the root of the mesentery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F76574\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef76574 \">image 1</a>). The mesenteric swirl sign has high sensitivity (78 to 100 percent) and specificity (80 to 90 percent) and can be easily recognized by experienced radiologists with high interobserver agreement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-complications-of-bariatric-surgical-operations/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imaging-studies-after-bariatric-surgery#H20337974\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Imaging studies after bariatric surgery&quot;, section on 'Internal hernia'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3343951083\"><span class=\"h3\">Small bowel obstruction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Small bowel obstruction (SBO) can occur at any time after a RYGB, with a lifetime incidence of 3 to 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-complications-of-bariatric-surgical-operations/abstract/54,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,58</a>]. Post-RYGB SBO is most commonly caused by herniation of small intestine through one of the mesenteric defects (ie, internal hernias), which are discussed separately [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-complications-of-bariatric-surgical-operations/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>] (see <a href=\"#H33\" class=\"local\">'Internal hernias'</a> above). Alternatively, SBO can also be caused by adhesive disease, an incisional hernia, or intussusception (typically at the jejunojejunal [JJ] anastomosis). </p><p>Patients with SBO can present acutely or subacutely with vague, intermittent, crampy, and sharp abdominal pain usually unrelated to eating. Symptomatic patients should undergo CT scan, and those who are diagnosed with SBO due to internal hernia by CT scan should undergo urgent surgical exploration to reduce the hernia.

It is the result of rapid emptying of food into the small bowel. Due to the hyperosmolality of the food, rapid fluid shifts from the plasma into the bowel occur, resulting in hypotension and a sympathetic nervous system response. Patients often present with colicky abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, and tachycardia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-complications-of-bariatric-surgical-operations/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients should avoid foods that are high in simple sugar content and replace them with a diet consisting of high fiber, complex carbohydrate, and protein rich foods. Behavioral modification, such as small, frequent meals, and separating solids from liquid intake by 30 minutes, are also advocated. Usually, early dumping is self-limiting and resolves within 7 to 12 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-complications-of-bariatric-surgical-operations/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Late dumping syndrome</strong> &ndash; Late dumping syndrome, currently referred to as postprandial hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia (PHH), is a rare complication of bariatric surgery. It occurs in 0.1 to 0.3 percent of patients, most commonly after RYGB. Symptoms of PHH, including dizziness, fatigue, diaphoresis, and weakness, usually occur one to three hours after ingestion of a carbohydrate-rich meal, typically months to years after surgery, and are associated with documented hypoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-complications-of-bariatric-surgical-operations/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. The pathophysiology of PHH is not fully understood but likely includes alterations in multiple hormonal and glycemic patterns (eg, increase in incretin levels). Most patients with PHH can be managed with the same dietary modification suggested above for early dumping syndrome.

In a study of 290 severely obese patients undergoing bariatric surgery, 126 underwent RYGB, BPD was performed in 103 patients, and 61 patients had gastric banding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-complications-of-bariatric-surgical-operations/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. After RYGB, the proportion of patients with loose stools, diarrhea or frequent flatus increased significantly (46 versus 8 percent preoperatively). After BPD, 55 percent of the patients reported an increase in loose stools or diarrhea or frequent flatus versus 8 percent preoperatively. Conversely, after gastric banding, 39 percent of patients complained of constipation.</p><p>Steatorrhea and more frequent stools can occur with excessive fat intake. In addition, these symptoms can be due to subclinical lactose intolerance, which is only recognized when dairy products are used in an effort to achieve adequate protein intake after bariatric surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2870488029\"><span class=\"h3\">Gastrogastric (GG) fistula</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A gastrogastric fistula is a channel that develops between the gastric pouch and the excluded stomach remnant, allowing ingested food to enter the bypassed foregut (stomach and duodenum).

Patients diagnosed with a GG fistula who also have either significant weight regain or persistent symptoms from marginal ulcers (eg, abdominal pain, stomal stenosis, or gastrointestinal bleeding) are candidates for revision or repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-complications-of-bariatric-surgical-operations/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>].</p><p>Endoscopic techniques, including clipping, suturing, and stenting, have been used to treat GG fistula causing weight regain, but results are varied at best and recurrence rates are high [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-complications-of-bariatric-surgical-operations/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. Surgical revision is probably the best option for patients with persistent pain, bleeding, or stenosis from a GG fistula. Although revisional bariatric surgery is generally riskier than primary procedures, acceptable complication rates as low as 22 percent have been achieved in experienced hands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-complications-of-bariatric-surgical-operations/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>In preparation for dividing the GG fistula, the gastric pouch should be fully mobilized, and the path of the Roux limb should be outlined with an orogastric tube or endoscope. The GG fistula can be resected by stapling, in which case one must staple inside the previous staple line to avoid creating a blind pouch. Alternatively, the gastric remnant can be opened to allow the fistula to be accessed from the distal side. Once the anatomy is defined, a revision of the GJ anastomosis is performed.

Long term results from a series of 78 GB patients showed that nearly 40 percent of patients experienced major complications, 22 percent had minor complications, and almost half of the patients required reoperation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-complications-of-bariatric-surgical-operations/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. Major complications included pouch dilation (11 percent), band erosion (28 percent), and band infection (1 percent). Minor complications included incisional hernias (5 percent), port-tubing disconnections (20 percent), and port infections (2 percent). </p><p>Complications of GB can occur early or late. Early complications include acute stomal obstruction, band infection, gastric perforation, hemorrhage, bronchopneumonia, and delayed gastric emptying and pulmonary embolism.

Obstruction is usually caused by inclusion of excess perigastric fat, use of a band of insufficient diameter for the thickness of the tissue or significant tissue edema. Patients usually present with persistent nausea, vomiting, and inability to tolerate secretions or oral intake. The diagnosis is confirmed with an upper gastrointestinal series demonstrating no passage of contrast beyond the band.</p><p>Acute stomal obstruction due to edema can initially be treated conservatively with nasogastric tube decompression until the edema subsides, although a potential for aspiration pneumonia and stomach ischemia exists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-complications-of-bariatric-surgical-operations/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

Although the blood supply to the stomach is robust, the gastroesophageal junction tends to be an area of decreased vascularity and thus more prone to leaks. Additionally, the stomach tends to be thinner at the angle of His and some authors suggest that the large staple height used by many surgeons may not adequately seal this area of the stomach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-complications-of-bariatric-surgical-operations/abstract/138,150\" class=\"abstract_t\">138,150</a>].

Clinically stable patients may be able to undergo percutaneous drainage, antibiotic therapy, and parenteral nutrition until the leak is healed. Endoscopic therapy with the use of stents has also been employed for management of leaks, but migration of the stents has been a problem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/late-complications-of-bariatric-surgical-operations/abstract/153-157\" class=\"abstract_t\">153-157</a>].
