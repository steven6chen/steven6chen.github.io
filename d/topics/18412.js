Four methods to evaluate contractions are available: manual palpation, external tocodynamometry, internal tocodynamometry, and electrohysterography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-intrauterine-pressure-catheters/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>External palpation and external tocodynamometry are common methods of assessing uterine activity, and provide adequate information in most patients. However, external palpation is subjective and requires the physical presence of a clinician to perform frequent examinations. Although external tocodynamometry provides an objective record of the frequency and duration of contractions without requiring the physical presence of a clinician, the tracing can be interrupted by maternal movement, and contraction strength cannot be quantified. Internal tocodynamometry utilizing an intrauterine pressure catheter (IUPC) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F75267\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75267 \">picture 1</a>) overcomes these limitations, as it provides a reliable, quantitative measure of uterine activity with minimal artifacts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-intrauterine-pressure-catheters/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Electrohysterography is a noninvasive technology that detects uterine electrical activity using electrodes placed on the mother's abdominal wall. It may be as reliable and accurate as internal tocodynamometry, but it has not been studied extensively.</p><p>This topic will discuss the clinical use of IUPCs for monitoring uterine activity during labor. Diagnosis of normal and abnormal intrapartum uterine activity and management of protraction and arrest disorders are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-and-abnormal-labor-progression\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal and abnormal labor progression&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4738821\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL USES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IUPCs are not routinely used for monitoring uterine activity during spontaneous labor, induction, or augmentation because routine use does not lead to improved maternal or fetal outcomes while increasing costs, complexity, and complications compared with external methods (see <a href=\"#H4738943\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below). In a 2013 systematic review of three randomized trials comparing internal versus external tocodynamometry in almost 2000 women undergoing induction or augmentation of labor, internal tocodynamometry did not improve any maternal or neonatal outcome (eg, Apgar score, umbilical artery pH &lt;7.15, neonatal intensive care unit admission, operative delivery, hyperstimulation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-intrauterine-pressure-catheters/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>There are, however, clinical situations in which use of an internal monitor is preferable to external tocodynamometry. For example, we use an IUPC when:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>External tocodynamometry does not provide a clear tracing (eg, women who are frequently changing position, some obese women).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The precise relationship between the <span class=\"nowrap\">start/end</span> of fetal heart rate decelerations and the <span class=\"nowrap\">start/end</span> of contractions is not clear on the external tracing but necessary for interpreting the fetal heart rate pattern.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-and-abnormal-labor-progression#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal and abnormal labor progression&quot;, section on 'Normal labor progression'</a>.) Objective calculation of contraction strength is also helpful for titrating <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a> dose to provide optimal contractions while preventing hyperstimulation. This information is particularly reassuring when increasing the oxytocin dose in patients at increased risk of uterine rupture.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A conduit is needed for amnioinfusion (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amnioinfusion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Amnioinfusion&quot;</a>) or, rarely, for collection of amniotic fluid for laboratory testing.</p><p/><p>It is unclear whether use of an IUPC is helpful for facilitating the diagnosis of uterine rupture in women at high risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-intrauterine-pressure-catheters/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>].

The transducer tip and sensor tip catheters are flexible; the fluid-filled catheter is more rigid. The sensor tip and fluid-filled catheters require an external transducer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1461458878\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of catheter</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest choosing an IUPC based on personal preference, availability, and cost. The limited data of the safety and efficacy of transducer and sensor tip IUPCs suggest that they are basically equivalent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-intrauterine-pressure-catheters/abstract/15,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17,18</a>]. In a single randomized trial of 249 patients, the transducer tip catheter had a higher extramembranous (between the membranes and decidua) placement rate than the sensor-tipped catheter (12.5 versus 2.4 percent) but no difference in the frequency of abruption or fetal distress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-intrauterine-pressure-catheters/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. A search of the US Food and Drug Administration's public Manufacturer and User Facility Device Experience database from 1992 to 2012 identified three deaths and two injuries associated with use of transducer tip devices and four deaths and nine injuries associated with the sensor tip devices; however, causality specifically related to the device was not established for all cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-intrauterine-pressure-catheters/abstract/15,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,19</a>].</p><p>The fluid-filled IUPC was the first commercially available IUPC and is still available in some markets. In contrast to contemporary catheters, the tip is open and prone to plugging, particularly in pregnancies with thick meconium, and thus it is less reliable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-intrauterine-pressure-catheters/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. It is also more likely to cause a perforation because of its inflexibility.

The general principles for IUPC insertion are described below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-intrauterine-pressure-catheters/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perform a vaginal examination to confirm that membranes are ruptured and the cervix is sufficiently dilated to admit the catheter tip.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Insert the tip of the introducer (with the catheter inside) just inside the cervical os laterally and inside the amniotic cavity (avoid placement between the decidua and membranes). Lateral placement is easiest and least likely to cause complications. The symphysis and sacrum can increase resistance if anterior or posterior insertions are attempted.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid advancement of the rigid introducer beyond the examiner's fingers, which are placed just inside the cervix and against the presenting part.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perform insertion away from the placental site, if possible. A bedside ultrasound examination is reasonable if the placental site is unknown.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gently thread the catheter 10 to 14 cm into the amniotic cavity (indicated by the first imprinted mark on the catheter). In this position, the tip is usually just beyond the fetal head. Ultrasound guidance is not required.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The catheter should go in easily; if any resistance is met, the operator should pull the tip back into the introducer and then change the angle or position of the introducer. The catheter should never be forced as it is possible to pass it completely through the placenta, myometrium, or a velamentous umbilical cord [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-intrauterine-pressure-catheters/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flow of amniotic fluid through the catheter at this point indicates appropriate intra-amniotic placement. Lack of clear fluid suggests extramembranous placement. If the catheter is thought to be in a dry pocket, it can be withdrawn to the fingertips and then redirected to a different area and reinserted. If the absence of fluid is thought to be related to oligohydramnios, 10 to 20 mL of sterile saline or water can be flushed through the port and some of this fluid should return through the catheter. If these approaches are ineffective or gross blood is observed, removal of the catheter is prudent. (See <a href=\"#H3626477817\" class=\"local\">'Extramembranous placement'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When proper placement in the amniotic cavity is established, the catheter is advanced further (approximately 45 cm, indicated by the second imprinted mark). The introducer is removed and the IUPC is secured to the patient's upper medial thigh. The tip of the catheter should be in the uterine fundus, where intrauterine pressure recordings have the highest amplitude.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For sensor-tipped IUPCs, the monitor should be at zero before the electronic sensor tip is connected to the monitor cable. Transducer-tipped catheters may be zeroed prior to or after insertion of the catheter.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Baseline tone at term is between 5 and 25 mmHg, but may be higher preterm.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Note that extramembranous catheters will still provide readings, but they are not accurate reflections of intrauterine pressure and cannot be used for amnioinfusion.

Montevideo units (MVUs) are calculated by subtracting the baseline uterine pressure (resting tone) from the peak contraction pressure of each contraction in a 10-minute window and adding the pressures generated by each contraction; this sum is the number of MVUs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57354\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57354 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>In a retrospective report, 91 percent of women who had a spontaneous vaginal delivery after <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a> induction achieved contractile activity greater than 200 MVUs, and 40 percent reached 300 MVUs; the corresponding figures in women who had a spontaneous vaginal delivery after augmentation of spontaneous labor were 77 and 8 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-intrauterine-pressure-catheters/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In a study of spontaneously initiated normal labor, uterine activity averaged approximately 100 MVUs in the early first stage of labor, 175 MVUs in the advanced first stage, and 250 MVUs in the second stage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-intrauterine-pressure-catheters/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Based on these and other data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-intrauterine-pressure-catheters/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>], &quot;adequate&quot; MVUs have traditionally been defined as 200 to 250 MVUs (ie, expected to lead to a normal rate of cervical change and fetal descent), although this level of force generated does not always represent effective uterine contractility for an individual patient. The dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a> can be titrated to produce MVUs in this range, or the dose can be increased until there is normal progression of labor or strong contractions occurring at two- to three-minute intervals. No method has been proven to be superior to another. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=induction-of-labor-with-oxytocin#H7537379\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Induction of labor with oxytocin&quot;, section on 'Oxytocin'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4738943\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complications following IUPC placement are rare. However, significant changes in the fetal heart rate tracing, bleeding from the IUPC, or significant maternal pain should prompt immediate evaluation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3626477817\"><span class=\"h2\">Extramembranous placement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most major complications of IUPC placement are related to incorrect placement in the extramembranous (extraovular) space between the fetal membranes and decidua, which is not uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-intrauterine-pressure-catheters/abstract/20,26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,26-28</a>]. Signs of extramembranous placement include lack of fluid return and bloody return, if the catheter has an external transducer (these signs are not reliable signs of extramembranous placement for transducer-tipped catheters). Immediate fetal and maternal assessment is warranted as extramembranous placement can result in placental laceration or abruption. Removal versus redirection of the IUPC depends on the clinical situation (eg, maternal status, fetal status, blood in catheter).</p><p>There is no typical pressure reading that is diagnostic of extramembranous placement of an IUPC, but a high baseline damped waveform or negative reading is suggestive. Placental trauma may manifest as a nonreassuring fetal heart rate pattern <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> high contraction pressures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2620243008\"><span class=\"h2\">Uterine perforation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the tip of the catheter perforates the myometrium, clinical findings may include dry or bloody insertion, abdominal pain, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> signs of intra-abdominal bleeding (eg, tachycardia, hypotension). The cardiotocograph will be abnormal. A key finding is increased pressure upon maternal Valsalva but no increase during uterine contractions.</p><p>Uterine perforation rates for first-generation, inflexible fluid-filled catheters (1970s) ranged from 1 in 300 to 1 in 1400 insertions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-intrauterine-pressure-catheters/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. This risk has fallen dramatically with the introduction of flexible contemporary catheters: Only one case of uterine perforation has been published [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-intrauterine-pressure-catheters/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. In this case, fetal distress immediately after the placement of the IUPC led to an emergency cesarean delivery, which revealed a 5&thinsp;cm vertical laceration in the posterior lower uterine segment that was repaired.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3942860795\"><span class=\"h2\">Umbilical cord prolapse</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Umbilical cord prolapse can occur during placement, especially if the presenting part is dislodged during manipulation of the introducer and catheter.

Significant changes in the fetal heart rate tracing, bleeding from the IUPC, or significant maternal pain should prompt immediate evaluation.(See <a href=\"#H4738943\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/use-of-intrauterine-pressure-catheters/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Cohen WR.
