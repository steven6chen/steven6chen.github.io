Joint hypermobility (JHM) may be of no medical consequence and might even confer advantages for dancers, musicians, and athletes; however, it may also be associated with a number of comorbidities that constitute the cardinal features of the HDCT.</p><p>JHS is considered by many experts to be indistinguishable from, if not identical to, the most common variant of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), EDS-hypermobility type (EDS-HM). (See <a href=\"#H26926661\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> below.)</p><p>JHS is reviewed here. Overviews of the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of the Ehlers-Danlos syndromes; the clinical manifestations and treatment of the Marfan syndrome; osteogenesis imperfecta; and the Stickler syndrome are presented separately.

In one large survey in the United Kingdom, the combination of joint hypermobility (JHM) and chronic widespread pain, which is typical of many patients with JHS, was found in 3 percent of a general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-hypermobility-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. There has been a lack of general population studies or other studies of sufficient sample size to accurately estimate the prevalence of JHS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-hypermobility-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>JHS is considered by many experts in rheumatology and in clinical genetics to be indistinguishable from, if not identical to, the most common variant of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS), EDS-hypermobility type (EDS-HM), but the precise relationship between EDS-HM and JHS remains uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-hypermobility-syndrome/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ehlers-danlos-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>JHM alone is very common in the general population, affecting approximately 10 to 20 percent of individuals to some degree; it may be present either in isolated joints or be more generalized throughout the body. It is more common in childhood and adolescence, in females, and in Asians and West Africans. JHM tends to lessen with aging, and has strong heritability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-hypermobility-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26926668\"><span class=\"h1\">NATURAL HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Untreated individuals with joint hypermobility syndrome (JHS) may develop recurrent soft tissue injuries, fatigue, chronic regional or widespread pain, declining physical condition, anxiety states, and autonomic cardiovascular and bowel disturbance, but the frequency of each of these problems among patients with JHS is uncertain. When present, these conditions can have a major impact on activities of daily living and quality of life if not remedied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-hypermobility-syndrome/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26926675\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathophysiologic basis of joint hypermobility syndrome (JHS) and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome-hypermobility type (EDS-HM) is not fully understood. No structural abnormality in collagen or related proteins or in the genes encoding such molecules has been identified in the vast majority of patients with JHS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-hypermobility-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]; an exception is a small population with the JHS or EDS-HM phenotype (less than 10 percent of patients with JHS or EDS-HM) in whom a deficiency of tenascin X, a large extracellular matrix glycoprotein, has been described due to alterations in the <em>TNXB</em> gene or haploinsufficiency of the gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-hypermobility-syndrome/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p>The pattern of occurrence of JHS or EDS-HM in families is generally consistent with a dominant inheritance, but the penetrance of signs and symptoms is highly variable among family members. Detailed family studies have identified multiple pedigrees in which JHS, EDS-HM, or both segregate as a single dominant trait with complete penetrance, variable expression, and possibly an evolving phenotype, further supporting the view that these conditions are most often identical [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-hypermobility-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The diagnosis of EDS-HM was most common among children, and JHS was most common among older adults in this cross-sectional analysis. &#160;</p><p>The lack of a well-defined biologic marker in JHS contrasts with other hereditary disorders of connective tissue (HDCT), including other forms of EDS and Marfan syndrome, for which abnormalities in collagen and fibrillin biology and associated genetic polymorphisms are well documented.</p><p>Abnormalities that appear either unrelated or only indirectly related to connective tissue abnormalities have also been identified in JHS and may contribute to the pathogenesis of the clinical syndrome. These include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Poor proprioception is associated with joint hypermobility (JHM) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-hypermobility-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain is multifactorial.

The observed prevalence of anxiety is higher than other pain states, but the basis for this is not fully understood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-hypermobility-syndrome/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

Additionally, systemic features, including chronic widespread pain, fatigue, autonomic dysfunction, and gastrointestinal dysmotility, are often present in patients with JHS, which exhibits a complex spectrum of signs of symptoms of varying degrees and combinations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-hypermobility-syndrome/abstract/4,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,26</a>]. Estimates of the prevalence of various manifestations of JHS are generally based upon studies performed with the population seen in specialist clinical centers and our experience in such settings; the severity of disease and the prevalence of specific disease manifestations is likely to be less in the general population, but accurate community-based estimates are not available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-hypermobility-syndrome/abstract/4,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,26</a>].</p><p>Patients may present with any combination of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Musculoskeletal manifestations, which are present in patients with JHS, and may include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Recurrent acute pain from joint sprains and ligament and tendon injuries (universally present in JHS)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Recurrent joint subluxations (incomplete dislocation) or dislocations (common in JHS).

One point is awarded for the ability to perform each of nine maneuvers (including four maneuvers tested bilaterally and evaluation of the spine).

Marfan syndrome is the principal diagnosis to exclude, although there are a number of conditions that may be associated with JHM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/joint-hypermobility-syndrome/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Patients with JHM alone can be distinguished from JHS by the absence of additional symptoms or findings associated with JHS.

Other features of Marfan syndrome, including scoliosis, kyphosis, dilatation of the aortic root and aortic arch, aortic dissection, ectopia lentis, or dural ectasia, may help to distinguish the disorders.
