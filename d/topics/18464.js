Vaccines are also called &quot;vaccinations&quot; or &quot;immunizations.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1484037831\"><span class=\"h1\">Why should I get vaccinated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Different infections are found in different countries. People can get infections when they travel to other parts of the world. Getting vaccinated can help keep you from getting sick when you travel.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1484037838\"><span class=\"h1\">What vaccines do I need?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The vaccines that you will need depend on:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What countries you will travel to and what time of the year you will travel</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How long you will stay, where you will stay, and what you will do there</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your medical conditions</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Which vaccines you have had in the past</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you have allergies to substances in the vaccines</p><p/><p>Once your doctor or nurse has this information, he or she will recommend certain vaccines for you to get. These might include vaccines to prevent 1 or more of the following infections:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Yellow fever &ndash; Yellow fever is found in parts of Africa and Central and South America (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F55488\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55488 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F64157\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64157 \">figure 2</a>). People can get it after being bitten by an infected mosquito. The infection can cause liver problems and is sometimes fatal. Some countries need proof that visitors have gotten this vaccine before they can enter the country.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Typhoid &ndash; Typhoid is found in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. People can get it from drinking unclean water. It can cause a fever, rash, and belly pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatitis A &ndash; Hepatitis A is found all over the world.

Some vaccines work after just 1 dose. Others need 2 or more doses to prevent an infection.</p><p>Some vaccines prevent an infection for the rest of your life. Others do not. A &quot;booster&quot; is a vaccine dose given after a certain number of years. It reminds the body how to prevent an infection. People who got vaccines when younger might need booster doses before they travel.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1484037852\"><span class=\"h1\">When should I get vaccinated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most vaccines take 4 to 6 weeks to work.
