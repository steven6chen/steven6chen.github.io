The disorder can be effectively treated with cognitive-behavioral therapy, medication, or a combination of the two modalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-treating-panic-disorder-with-or-without-agoraphobia-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Patients with mild panic disorder whose symptoms do not interfere significantly with functioning may reasonably elect to forgo treatment initially. These are patients with limited to no phobic avoidance and no health concerns, whose day-to-day functioning is not being compromised by frequent panic attacks. Some of these patients may respond to education and reassurance with reduced anxiety about panic and come to have less frequent attacks and gradual disappearance of symptoms. </p><p>Clinical follow-up with the patient every six months is important to monitor the course of the disorder, and determine if symptoms were worsening <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> impeding functioning &ndash; indications that treatment may then be advisable.

There is no evidence of robust differences in effectiveness between these modalities in panic disorder. A meta-analysis of 11 trials that compared CBT with antidepressants found that the two interventions led to similarly improved response rates and reductions in global anxiety and depression, with neither intervention showing an advantage over the other [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-treating-panic-disorder-with-or-without-agoraphobia-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. As an example, a randomized clinical trial assigned 312 patients with panic disorder to receive either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imipramine</a> only, CBT only, placebo, or imipramine plus CBT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-treating-panic-disorder-with-or-without-agoraphobia-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. After three months of treatment, patients treated with imipramine only and CBT only were more likely to respond compared with the placebo treated group (45.8 and 48.7 versus 21.7 percent). </p><p>Trials have suggested that patients who completed a course of CBT are less likely to experience relapse in the year following treatment compared with patients who were treated with medication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-treating-panic-disorder-with-or-without-agoraphobia-in-adults/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Treatment of patients with panic disorder with the combination of antidepressants and CBT is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H1145240097\" class=\"local\">'Subgroups needing specialized treatment'</a> below.)</p><p>In our clinical experience, some patients have strong preferences between medication and psychotherapy, including beliefs associated with the treatments and medication side effects or concerns about the time needed for psychotherapy. Individuals for whom CBT works best are generally highly motivated and value a problem-solving approach, while the absence of this motivation and belief may make CBT a less optimal choice. There is wide variation across the United States and internationally in the availability of therapists trained to provide CBT for anxiety disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-treating-panic-disorder-with-or-without-agoraphobia-in-adults/abstract/8,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,11</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4191701630\"><span class=\"h3\">Preference for psychotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with panic disorder treated with psychotherapy, we suggest first-line treatment with CBT rather than other psychotherapies. CBT is supported by a greater number of randomized clinical trials with more participants compared with other psychotherapies tested in panic disorder. In a meta-analysis of five randomized clinical trials of 328 patients with panic <span class=\"nowrap\">disorder/agoraphobia,</span> CBT has been found have higher response rates in comparison with a pill placebo or psychological control condition (odds ratio = 2.5, 95% CI 1.2-5.4) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-treating-panic-disorder-with-or-without-agoraphobia-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Follow-up studies have documented maintenance of initial gains over a 6- to 12-month period. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psychotherapy-for-panic-disorder-with-or-without-agoraphobia-in-adults#H157308639\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Psychotherapy for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia in adults&quot;, section on 'Cognitive-behavioral therapy'</a>.)</p><p>Two large effectiveness studies found that CBT delivered by novice therapists (after training) to primary care patients with panic disorder led to similar benefits, suggesting that the treatment is broadly generalizable and may not require doctoral level expertise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-treating-panic-disorder-with-or-without-agoraphobia-in-adults/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. </p><p>There are few clinical trials comparing CBT with other psychotherapies in panic disorder; however, available data support the use of CBT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-treating-panic-disorder-with-or-without-agoraphobia-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In a network meta-analysis, which included studies of CBT, psychodynamic therapy, psychoeducation, supportive psychotherapy, physiological therapies, cognitive therapy, and behavioral therapy, CBT was the most extensively studied psychotherapy and was often superior to other therapies, although the effect size was small and the level of precision was often insufficient to be clinically relevant. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H517360425\"><span class=\"h3\">Preference for medication</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with panic disorder who prefer medication treatment, we suggest first-line treatment with a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) rather than other medications. SSRIs, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), tricyclic antidepressants (TCADs), monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs), and benzodiazepines have demonstrated efficacy in panic disorder. There are few head-to-head clinical trials comparing these drugs in panic disorder but these trials and trials comparing these drugs with placebo suggest that they all have comparable efficacy. Where these medications differ, guiding selection among them, is in the extent of supporting evidence, side effect profile, and their potential for abuse (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacotherapy-for-panic-disorder-with-or-without-agoraphobia-in-adults#H11968364\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacotherapy for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia in adults&quot;, section on 'Medications'</a>): </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Efficacy</strong> &ndash; Among medications for panic disorder, SSRIs have been the most widely tested in clinical trials and shown to be efficacious compared with placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-treating-panic-disorder-with-or-without-agoraphobia-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Side effect profile</strong> &ndash; SSRIs have a relatively benign side effect profile compared with tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The SNRI <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venlafaxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">venlafaxine</a> extended-release (ER) is a second choice for use if SSRIs are ineffective because it can cause hypertension, particularly at higher doses.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Overdose</strong> &ndash; SSRIs are safe in overdose in comparison with tricyclic antidepressants and monoamine oxidase inhibitors; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venlafaxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">venlafaxine</a> ER may be more dangerous in overdose compared with SSRIs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong><span class=\"nowrap\">Abuse/dependence</strong></span> &ndash; SSRIs and all antidepressants lack the abuse potential and physiologic dependence seen with benzodiazepines.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cost</strong> &ndash; The growing availability of less costly generic SSRIs mitigates against the cost advantages of older antidepressants.</p><p/><p>Therapeutic doses of SSRIs are approximately the same for panic disorder as for the treatment of depression. Starting doses from the lower end of the recommended range should be used to avoid initial agitation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F77409\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77409 \">table 1</a>). Time to onset of clinically meaningful action for an SSRI varies by patient, but averages approximately four weeks. The initial therapeutic dose should be continued for four to six weeks. If the patient does not show a robust response the SSRI should be increased in one- to two-week increments until sufficient improvement is seen or the maximum recommended or highest tolerated dose is reached.</p><p>As an example, treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sertraline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sertraline</a> can be initiated at 25 mg per day. After a week, sertraline can be increased to a therapeutic dose of 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> and continued for a total of four weeks. If the patient does not experience a robust clinical response, sertraline can be titrated up in weekly or biweekly increments of 50 mg to a maximum of 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>. Similarly, doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=escitalopram-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">escitalopram</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=citalopram-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">citalopram</a> should begin at 5 mg and 10 mg a day with doubling after one week and further titration as with sertraline.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1145240097\"><span class=\"h2\">Subgroups needing specialized treatment</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H213938075\"><span class=\"h3\">Suicidality or co-occurring mental disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Depression, posttraumatic stress disorder, and other anxiety disorders may co-occur with panic disorder. In patients treated for panic disorder who have suicidality or one of these co-occurring disorders, we suggest first-line treatment with the combination of an SSRI antidepressant and CBT.

A randomized effectiveness trial in the primary care setting found that the addition of even one component of CBT to medications for panic <span class=\"nowrap\">disorder/agoraphobia</span> resulted in clinically meaningful improvement following treatment and 12 months later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-treating-panic-disorder-with-or-without-agoraphobia-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Some patients with panic disorder and severe depression may be too symptomatic to fully engage and participate in CBT. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H114872845\"><span class=\"h3\">Marked initial distress or impairment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some patients with panic disorder experience marked distress or impairment (eg, agitation or insomnia) and cannot tolerate the weeks before an antidepressant takes effect. </p><p>In treating these panic symptoms, the clinician should assess the patient with additional diagnostic questions and clinical scrutiny to ensure that the symptoms are not the result of an undiagnosed atypical bipolar disorder with the serotonin reuptake inhibitor precipitating a &ldquo;mixed-state&rdquo; switch. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bipolar-disorder-in-adults-clinical-features#H2273002\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bipolar disorder in adults: Clinical features&quot;, section on 'Mixed features'</a>.)</p><p>For most patients with panic disorder and initial distress, adding the long-acting benzodiazepine, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonazepam</a>, to the antidepressant is suggested, beginning with a dose of 0.25 to 0.5 mg at bedtime and increasing by 0.25 to 0.5 mg every three days until symptomatic distress is improved. After 10 to 12 weeks, maximal antidepressant efficacy should have been reached and taper of clonazepam can occur by 0.25 mg per week until 0.5 mg is reached and then by 0.125 mg per week. There is no rush to complete the taper and a slow gradual approach will minimize any withdrawal symptoms. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H102929432\"><span class=\"h3\">Co-occurring substance use disorder</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In panic disorder patients with a co-occurring, active substance use disorder (SUD) or a history of an SUD from benzodiazepines or other prescription drugs, panic symptoms should generally not be treated with a benzodiazepine, either for initial distress, partial response to a serotonergic antidepressant, or treatment resistance. There may be exceptions in patients who have failed alternative approaches including both additional medications and CBT. (See <a href=\"#H114872845\" class=\"local\">'Marked initial distress or impairment'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3296697819\" class=\"local\">'Partial response to first SRI'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3265630500\" class=\"local\">'Treatment-resistant'</a> below.)</p><p>Rather than using a benzodiazepine for these patients, we favor augmenting antidepressant treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregabalin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pregabalin</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mirtazapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mirtazapine</a> for initial distress or a partial response to medication. These agents can also be used as monotherapy following medication nonresponse. Like benzodiazepines, the onset of these medications&rsquo; clinical effects occur within hours; however, they have much lower risks of abuse, development of physiologic dependence, or a prominent discontinuation syndrome.

(See <a href=\"#H102929432\" class=\"local\">'Co-occurring substance use disorder'</a> above.)</p><p>If benzodiazepines or the nonaddictive alternatives are not effective, a tricyclic antidepressant can be tried. While similar to the serotonergic antidepressants in efficacy, tricyclic antidepressants have largely been replaced by the serotonergic antidepressants. The greater side effect burden, cardiovascular effects, and morbidity and mortality in overdose of tricyclic antidepressants must be weighed against the potential clinical benefit. Patients with panic disorder are often highly sensitive to somatic symptoms, and less able to tolerate tricyclic antidepressant side effects. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacotherapy-for-panic-disorder-with-or-without-agoraphobia-in-adults#H11968463\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacotherapy for panic disorder with or without agoraphobia in adults&quot;, section on 'Tricyclic antidepressants'</a>.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nortriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Nortriptyline</a> would be preferred among tricyclic antidepressants based on its lower propensity to induce postural hypotension and lower rate of anticholinergic side effects both of which may produce physical sensations that exacerbate panic disorder worries. Blood levels are available but have only been validated for efficacy for major depression (therapeutic window of 50 to 150 mg). These could be used to check for adherence and to aim for the lower end of the therapeutic window in order to minimize side effects.</p><p>While <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imipramine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomipramine</a> are superior to placebo reduced the frequency of panic attacks in clinical trials, their effects on anticipatory anxiety and phobic avoidance has been found to be more variable and, in some cases, less robust compared with other antidepressants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-treating-panic-disorder-with-or-without-agoraphobia-in-adults/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. </p><p>Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI) are another option for patients who do not respond to previously discussed medications and are willing and able to adhere to strict medication and dietary restrictions. MAOIs have demonstrated efficacy in panic disorder against panic attacks and somatic symptom preoccupation based on much older pre-DSM-III studies. In our experience, they are unusually effective in rare cases of panic disorder that have failed multiple other treatments both pharmacologic and psychotherapeutic. </p><p>Due to the risk of serotonin syndrome, MAOIs should not be prescribed concurrently with a SSRI or SNRI, and discontinuation of the serotonergic drug should be followed by a washout period based on the drug's half-life prior to initiating MAOI. </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenelzine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Phenelzine</a> is the preferred MAOI, based on its more frequent use in these older studies, and can be started at 15 mg daily for three days, then 15 mg twice a day for seven days, then 15 mg three times a day for 10 days, and then 30 mg twice a day thereafter. Dose increments should be based on tolerability and longer periods of time may be required to get used to the medication. A dose of 60 mg is likely the minimally effective dose for panic disorder based on older studies of anxious depression.
