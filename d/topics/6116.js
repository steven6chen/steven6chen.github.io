Enteric fever is also called &quot;typhoid fever.&quot; The fever usually happens along with belly pain and chills.</p><p>Enteric fever is not very common in the United States or Europe, but it does occur in other parts of the world, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>South-central and Southeast Asia, which includes India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal, and the Philippines</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Africa</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Latin America and the Caribbean, which includes Mexico, El Salvador, and Haiti</p><p/><p>In these places, the infection that causes enteric fever spreads when people eat or drink things that have the bacteria in them. The bacteria can get into foods and drinks in different ways:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People who are infected can spread their germs to the food they cook if they do not wash their hands before they touch the food.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bacteria can get into the water supply through the bowel movements of infected people. Then, if the water is not treated properly and is used in cooking or cleaning, it can spread the infection.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2371502410\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of enteric fever?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Belly pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chills</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Rose spots&quot; &ndash; Faint, salmon-colored spots on the belly and trunk</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2371502425\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you have symptoms of enteric fever, see your doctor or nurse. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2371502440\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for enteric fever?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. To find out if you are infected by the bacteria that cause enteric fever, your doctor or nurse can order a &quot;culture&quot; test on your blood. He or she might also order a culture test on a sample of one of these things:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bowel movement</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urine</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin from one of the rose spots</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2371502455\"><span class=\"h1\">How is enteric fever treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment involves taking antibiotic pills for up to 2 weeks. If you are put on antibiotics to treat enteric fever, it is very important that stay on the medicines for as long as your doctor recommends. Otherwise the infection could come back.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2371502470\"><span class=\"h1\">Can enteric fever be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. There are 2 main ways to keep from getting enteric fever:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Get the vaccine before you travel</strong> &ndash; If you are planning a trip outside of the US and Europe, ask your doctor or nurse if you need the &quot;<a href=\"topic.htm?path=typhoid-vaccine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">typhoid vaccine</a>&quot; or any other vaccines. There are 2 forms of the vaccine. One comes in 4 pills that you take on different days. The other comes in a single shot. The vaccine is not 100 percent effective. People can still get enteric fever even if they got the vaccine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Be careful what you eat and drink</strong> &ndash; While traveling to places outside of the US and Europe:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Wash your hands with soap and water before eating or handling food.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Drink only bottled water or water that has been boiled for at least 1 minute.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Do not get ice in drinks and do not eat popsicles or flavored ice.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Eat food that has been completely cooked and is still hot.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Eat only fruits that have a peel and that you wash and peel yourself. Do not eat the peels.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Do not eat raw vegetables or salads.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Do not buy food or drinks from street vendors.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2371502485\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-poisoning-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Food poisoning (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaccines-for-travel-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vaccines for travel (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-poisoning-foodborne-illness-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Food poisoning (foodborne illness) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-travel-advice-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: General travel advice (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
