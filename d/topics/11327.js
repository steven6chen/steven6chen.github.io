As the disease advances, however, the effect of levodopa begins to wear off several hours after some or even all doses, leaving patients aware that the duration of action of a dose of levodopa is not being sustained. As many as 50 percent of patients on levodopa for several years will experience motor fluctuations and dyskinesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-fluctuations-and-dyskinesia-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H828021487\"><span class=\"h2\">Motor fluctuations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Motor fluctuations are alterations between periods of being &quot;on,&quot; during which the patient experiences a positive response to medication, and being &quot;off,&quot; during which the patient experiences a reemergence of the Parkinson symptoms suppressed during the &quot;on&quot; state. The reason motor fluctuations occur is not entirely clear, but current thinking holds that motor fluctuations evolve as PD progresses because progressive degeneration of the nigro-striatal dopaminergic pathway reduces the ability of nerve terminals to store and release dopamine physiologically. As a result of this loss of storage capacity, the response to exogenous levodopa defaults to a more pulsatile or bolus impact on postsynaptic dopamine receptors (the short duration response) in keeping with levodopa's short (90 minute) half-life and its rapid cycling pharmacokinetics. Plasma levels of levodopa may fluctuate because of the additional problem of erratic intestinal absorption related to slowed intestinal motility and other factors.</p><p>There are several types of motor fluctuations, including the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Wearing off&quot; phenomenon, characterized by the re-emergence of parkinsonian motor problems as the effect of levodopa diminishes near the end of the dose interval (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'&quot;Wearing off&quot; phenomenon'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unpredictable &quot;off&quot; periods, with no obvious relationship between the time of levodopa administration and the appearance of &quot;off&quot; episodes (see <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Unpredictable &quot;off&quot; periods'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Freezing of gait (see <a href=\"#H869237314\" class=\"local\">'Freezing of gait'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Failure of the &quot;on&quot; response, with lack of an &quot;on&quot; response following a dose of levodopa (see <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Failure of &quot;on&quot; response'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute akinesia, which manifests as a sudden severe exacerbation of PD including an akinetic state that lasts for several days and does not respond to treatment with antiparkinson medication (see <a href=\"#H273522745\" class=\"local\">'Acute akinesia'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1735039232\"><span class=\"h2\">Dyskinesia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dyskinesia consists of levodopa-related abnormal, involuntary movements. While caused by a relative excess amount of levodopa, dyskinesia can occur at a dose that is otherwise therapeutic and does not necessarily represent an overdose. Dyskinesia are especially common in patients with young-onset (eg, before age of 50 years) PD; they are mostly associated with the use of levodopa but can occur with dopamine agonists, especially when added to enhance the effect of levodopa. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacologic-treatment-of-parkinson-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacologic treatment of Parkinson disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Levodopa-related dyskinesia encompass a variety of involuntary movements, including chorea, dystonia, ballism, and myoclonus. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-fluctuations-and-dyskinesia-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Dyskinesia tend to appear when the patient is &quot;on&quot; and are usually choreiform. Dyskinesia in the &quot;off&quot; state is more commonly dystonic but can be any of those listed above. Early morning dystonic inversion of a foot (usually on the side of greater parkinsonian involvement) occurs as a withdrawal reaction because of the long interval without medication overnight. Dyskinesia are sometimes mistaken for manifestations of progressive PD or confused with tremor by patients and their families, rather than recognized as reversible consequences of levodopa treatment.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peak-dose choreiform dyskinesia usually starts 30 to 90 minutes after a dose of levodopa (see <a href=\"#H1154243695\" class=\"local\">'Peak-dose dyskinesia'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diphasic dyskinesia has two peaks after each levodopa dose: the first when patients turn &quot;on&quot; and the second when they begin to turn &quot;off&quot; (see <a href=\"#H1154244055\" class=\"local\">'Diphasic dyskinesia'</a> below)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Wearing off&quot; dystonia; dyskinesia can take the form of dystonic posturing, which more commonly occurs during an &quot;off&quot; period (see <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Dystonia'</a> below)</p><p/><p>Other antiparkinson drugs are much less likely to produce these motor abnormalities, but some, such as the dopamine agonists, may exacerbate them once they have already occurred following treatment with levodopa. Dyskinesia occurs in 30 to 40 percent of patients treated with levodopa during the first five years of use and nearly 60 percent or more by 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-fluctuations-and-dyskinesia-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Dyskinesia management'</a> below.)</p><p>Levodopa was given in relatively high doses when it was first used as therapy for PD in the late 1960s and early 1970s. As a result, dyskinesia was often seen early in treatment, especially in individuals with advanced PD who were being treated for the first time. Once levodopa was combined with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbidopa-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbidopa</a>, the amount of levodopa required to produce a clinical benefit was drastically reduced. Consequently, dyskinesia became much less common in the early stages of treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H950431518\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinician should ask patients with PD at each regular visit whether they sense jerky movements during a dosing cycle or a waning of benefit of some or all of their doses before the next dose is due. Some patients may confuse dyskinesia and tremor; direct observation or home video may be necessary if this confusion cannot be resolved by interviewing the patient. One can also inquire if the patient takes a dose of levodopa on a fixed schedule (by the clock) or when he or she feels the current dose is wearing off. Since protein intake in the diet can be a factor in causing an erratic response to levodopa, the clinician should pay close attention to when and what the patient eats in relation to the response to levodopa dosing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-fluctuations-and-dyskinesia-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Direct observation of the patient during a prolonged outpatient visit as he or she passes through one or more dosing cycles can be useful to determine the relationship of levodopa doses to &quot;off&quot; and &quot;on&quot; episodes and to observe directly for dyskinesia that either are or are not perceptible to the patient. Short home video recordings while the patient is experiencing &quot;off&quot; episodes, &quot;on&quot; episodes, dyskinesia, or dystonia can be very valuable, particularly if it is impractical for the patient to attend a prolonged outpatient visit. Symptom diaries may be helpful but are sometimes unreliable, especially if the patient is unfamiliar with definitions of what constitutes dyskinesia, dystonia, or &quot;off&quot; episodes. It is essential to carefully establish definitions for these terms with the patient and family before beginning to use diaries or video recordings so that they are informative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-fluctuations-and-dyskinesia-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H950431130\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main medical strategies for patients with PD who develop motor complications are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adjusting the levodopa doses and dosing schedule</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adding an additional antiparkinson medication</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Manipulating dietary protein intake if there is suspicion that it is contributing to motor fluctuation</p><p/><p>In general, referral for evaluation by a movement disorder specialist is warranted for patients requiring levodopa dosing more than four or five times daily and for those who have severe, troublesome motor fluctuations despite optimal oral or transdermal levodopa or adjunctive therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-fluctuations-and-dyskinesia-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>For patients who fail oral and transdermal medical therapies, options include deep brain stimulation (DBS), continuous levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel (LCIG) infusion, and continuous subcutaneous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=apomorphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">apomorphine</a> infusion (CSAI). These are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=device-assisted-and-surgical-treatments-for-parkinson-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Device-assisted and surgical treatments for Parkinson disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">&quot;Wearing off&quot; phenomenon</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with PD often begin to be aware of a &quot;wearing off&quot; or end-of-dose effect less than four hours following a dose of levodopa. This problem may develop early in their experience with levodopa, although the majority will notice &quot;wearing off&quot; within three to five years after starting levodopa. Strategies that may be helpful include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Examine the effect of diet, and advise those patients who find that a high protein meal blocks the effect of a dose of levodopa taken at the time of eating to take levodopa on an empty stomach, at least one half-hour or more before or one hour after a meal, depending on the individual's response to empirical trials.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In some cases, &quot;wearing off&quot; can be managed initially by increasing the dose of levodopa if the patient is taking a relatively low dose and is not having side effects. However, in most cases, individual levodopa doses should be left unchanged. For patients with more advanced PD, reducing the interval between doses by 30 to 60 minutes is often a more effective strategy. This may require the addition of an extra levodopa dose at the end of the day, especially if the patient is planning to be out of the house in the evening. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Alteration of levodopa dosing'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some patients may benefit from alternative levodopa formulations, such as coated extended-release <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbidopa-and-levodopa-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbidopa-levodopa</a> tablets or carbidopa-levodopa extended release capsules. These may be more effective than standard carbidopa-levodopa for reducing motor fluctuations, although an increase in late-day dyskinesia is a risk. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Alteration of levodopa dosing'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adding an oral dopamine agonist such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pramipexole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pramipexole</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ropinirole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ropinirole</a> (available as short- and long-acting formulations), or the dopamine agonist in a skin patch formulation (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=rotigotine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rotigotine</a>) are other options, but one has to watch for excessive dopaminergic effects (eg, visual hallucinations, confusion, somnolence, hypotension, impulse control disorders, or an increase in dyskinesia) and be prepared to lower the levodopa dose accordingly.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subcutaneous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=apomorphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">apomorphine</a> injections may be helpful for patients with sudden and severe episodes of &quot;wearing off.&quot; This rescue therapy is effective, but the patient must be premedicated with a prophylactic antiemetic such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethobenzamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethobenzamide</a> because of the tendency of apomorphine to cause nausea and vomiting in the induction phase of its use; trimethobenzamide can generally be discontinued shortly after initiation of apomorphine. In addition, the effective dose of subcutaneous apomorphine must be established for each patient by test administration, starting with the lowest dose, during an outpatient evaluation of several hours prior to initiating therapy. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Dopamine agonists'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adding the catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitors <a href=\"topic.htm?path=entacapone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">entacapone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tolcapone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tolcapone</a>, which prolong and potentiate the levodopa effect. Entacapone should be given first because of the small risk that tolcapone can cause an elevation of liver enzymes. Be prepared to lower the levodopa dose by up to 30 percent because of the increased risk of peak-dose dyskinesia if tolcapone is used. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'COMT inhibitors'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adding the monoamine oxidase (MAO) B inhibitors <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rasagiline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rasagiline</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=safinamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">safinamide</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selegiline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">selegiline</a>, which prolong the half-life of dopamine in the brain (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'MAO B inhibitors'</a> below). Some experts believe that the MAO B inhibitors are not as effective as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=entacapone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">entacapone</a>, though some consider that the effect of rasagiline is comparable to that of entacapone.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h3\">Alteration of levodopa dosing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>&quot;Wearing off&quot; can be managed initially by increasing the dose of levodopa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-fluctuations-and-dyskinesia-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], if the patient is not having dyskinesia and is taking a relatively low dose. However, increasing the dose of levodopa often exacerbates dyskinesia without increasing the dose-related duration of benefit. Shortening the interdose interval while administering lower doses (ie, smaller but more frequent doses, sometimes called levodopa dose fractionation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-fluctuations-and-dyskinesia-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]) is usually a more effective approach.</p><p>It is often difficult to titrate the levodopa dose precisely, and some patients begin to exhibit an &quot;all or none&quot; response, whereby individual lower doses produce no evident clinical response and slightly higher doses trigger an over-response with dyskinesia. While the precise mechanism for this &quot;all or none&quot; response is uncertain, one hypothesis is that the pharmacologic response threshold becomes higher in more advanced PD than it is in earlier PD. However, this explanation was challenged by findings from a longitudinal study that monitored the response to levodopa infusions in 20 subjects with PD, which found that the onset and offset of the antiparkinsonian response and dyskinesia were similar when dyskinesia first emerged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-fluctuations-and-dyskinesia-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. This result suggests that the thresholds for dyskinesia and the antiparkinsonian response are similar from early in long-term therapy and that a therapeutic window between the antiparkinsonian response and dyskinesia no longer exists once dyskinesia emerges.</p><p>Various formulations of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbidopa-and-levodopa-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbidopa-levodopa</a> may be used to manage &quot;off&quot; time in PD:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A capsule formulation of extended-release <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbidopa-and-levodopa-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbidopa-levodopa</a> may be more effective than standard carbidopa-levodopa for reducing motor fluctuations. The extended-release capsule contains beads of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbidopa-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbidopa</a> and levodopa in a 1:4 ratio that, after dissolving, are absorbed in the gastrointestinal tract at different rates. A randomized controlled trial showed that extended-release carbidopa-levodopa reduced &quot;off&quot; time by approximately 70 minutes a day compared with immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa, though the final total daily levodopa dose of the extended-release formulation was on average approximately twice that of the immediate-release formulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-fluctuations-and-dyskinesia-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Another trial demonstrated that the extended-release formulation reduced &quot;off&quot; time compared with immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa combined with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=entacapone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">entacapone</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-fluctuations-and-dyskinesia-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Unlike the older formulation of controlled-release carbidopa-levodopa, extended-release carbidopa-levodopa capsules can be opened and the beads sprinkled on a small amount of applesauce to ease administration for patients who have difficulty swallowing pills. However, the extended-release capsule formulation is more expensive than standard formulations of carbidopa-levodopa.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An early study suggested that the older tablet formulation of controlled-release <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbidopa-and-levodopa-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbidopa-levodopa</a> was useful in the early stages of the &quot;wearing off&quot; phenomenon and could add up to 90 additional minutes throughout the day to levodopa's duration of effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-fluctuations-and-dyskinesia-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

As noted above, some patients may have the misperception that their &quot;offs&quot; are random and unpredictable, but direct observation can prove that the &quot;offs&quot; are actually episodes of predictable, dose related &quot;wearing off.&quot;</p><p>Interference with duodenal absorption and subsequent intravascular transport of the levodopa molecule to the brain by neutral amino acids in a high-protein meal has received much attention as a cause of &quot;offs&quot; that follow meals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-fluctuations-and-dyskinesia-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Avoiding levodopa within 30 to 60 minutes of a protein meal may be helpful. A protein redistribution diet in which most dietary protein intake is reserved for the evening was useful in the majority of such patients in small studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-fluctuations-and-dyskinesia-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>], but the quality of the studies was generally low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-fluctuations-and-dyskinesia-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>], and many patients find this type of diet impractical.

Random freezing is poorly responsive to any of the available treatment modalities, including antiparkinson medications and device-assisted therapies such as deep brain stimulation or continuous levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel infusion. During an episode of FOG, patients suddenly become immobilized for seconds to minutes at a time, usually when initiating walking, in a confined space such as a doorway or a closet, or when getting on or off an elevator. An episode of FOG can lead to falling, which is usually forward as the individual tries to move forward and his feet remain behind.</p><p>A review of FOG provides a useful approach to management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-fluctuations-and-dyskinesia-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. First, whether freezing is troublesome needs to be determined. Attempts to treat it with medication adjustments may not be necessary if it is brief and occurs only occasionally. Physical and occupational therapy to determine if there are specific precipitants such as turning, pivoting, or getting on an elevator may lead to suggestions on how to avoid FOG. Movement strategies or cues that may help the patient &quot;get into gear&quot; include shifting weight, making wider turns, concentrating on taking larger steps forward, or using visual imagery as if to step over an obstacle. A cane or special laser cane may also be helpful for FOG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-fluctuations-and-dyskinesia-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p>Management of more severe and prolonged FOG includes medication adjustments, non-medication strategies, and assessing comorbidities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-fluctuations-and-dyskinesia-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. In such cases, it is crucial to determine when and how FOG relates to the timing of levodopa doses. Dopa-responsive FOG occurs during end of dose &quot;wearing off&quot; periods and usually responds to shortening levodopa dose intervals or increasing the levodopa dose to avoid &quot;wearing off&quot; episodes. Adding or increasing dopamine agonists is usually not as effective and may even aggravate FOG. There are conflicting data from two small randomized controlled trials regarding the utility of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylphenidate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylphenidate</a> for gait freezing and hypokinesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-fluctuations-and-dyskinesia-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>]. Subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (DBS) is another option for levodopa-responsive FOG.</p><p>Levodopa-related FOG is less common, accounting for only approximately 5 percent of cases of FOG, but much more difficult to treat. Fortunately, it is usually far briefer in duration than dopa-responsive FOG. It occurs at peak levodopa effect and may respond to reducing the dopamine agonist first followed by reducing the levodopa dose (if necessary) although this step may compromise the levodopa response of other motor symptoms. The value of pedunculopontine nucleus DBS is unproven in the management of levodopa-related FOG as results following its use have been inconsistent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/motor-fluctuations-and-dyskinesia-in-parkinson-disease/abstract/54-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">54-56</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Failure of &quot;on&quot; response</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with motor fluctuations sometimes fail to turn &quot;on&quot; following a dose of levodopa.

However, this strategy may lead to progressively increasing peak-dose dyskinesia as the day goes on. Addition of a dopamine agonist and a marked reduction in the levodopa dose should be tried in such patients, or, in some cases, if tolerated, frequent doses of levodopa can be kept high, above the dystonia threshold. The main problem with this unusual form of motor fluctuation is management of occasionally prolonged dyskinesia at the end of the day when the patient goes to bed. Adjusted continuous levodopa-carbidopa intestinal gel infusion, deep brain stimulation, or continuous subcutaneous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=apomorphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">apomorphine</a> infusion (where available) should be considered if other strategies for management are unsuccessful.

Younger patients on levodopa can experience these complications soon after starting treatment. Dyskinesia can occur in any patient if the dose is high enough. Motor fluctuations are alterations between periods of being &quot;on,&quot; during which the patient enjoys a good response to a dose of levodopa, and being &quot;off,&quot; during which the patient experiences worsening parkinsonian symptoms. Dyskinesia consists of various types of abnormal involuntary movements which are due to the effects of levodopa. (See <a href=\"#H869236874\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A number of strategies may be useful for patients with PD who develop motor fluctuations and dyskinesia. In general, these include adjusting the levodopa regimen (including changes to the amount of levodopa and interdose intervals or the levodopa formulation), and adding adjunct medication such as dopamine agonists, catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT) inhibitors, or monoamine oxidase (MAO) B inhibitors. Adjusting dietary protein is appropriate if protein interference with levodopa absorption is a problem. (See <a href=\"#H950431130\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Wearing off&quot; can be managed initially by increasing the dose of levodopa. However, this may induce or exacerbate dyskinesia, confusion, hallucinations, insomnia, or other side effects. Shortening the interdose interval by 30 to 60 minutes while administering lower doses (ie, smaller but more frequent doses) is also a consideration. A capsule formulation of extended-release <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbidopa-and-levodopa-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbidopa-levodopa</a> may be more effective than standard carbidopa-levodopa for reducing motor fluctuations. Adding a second drug is suggested if adjustments to the levodopa regimen are not successful for reducing &quot;wearing off.&quot; Options for adjunct treatment include dopamine agonist, COMT inhibitor, or MAO B inhibitor drugs. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'&quot;Wearing off&quot; phenomenon'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management of unpredictable &quot;off&quot; periods is similar to that of &quot;wearing off,&quot; although it typically is more challenging. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Unpredictable &quot;off&quot; periods'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Freezing of gait can occur as a transient &quot;off&quot; phenomenon, treatable by the above strategies, or randomly at variable frequency in patients with advanced PD. Random freezing is notoriously unresponsive to any of the available treatment modalities. (See <a href=\"#H869237314\" class=\"local\">'Freezing of gait'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute akinesia should prompt a search for systemic infection or other intercurrent medical problems that are capable of causing a sudden worsening of parkinsonism. (See <a href=\"#H273522745\" class=\"local\">'Acute akinesia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Strategies that may be useful for managing the failure of &quot;on&quot; response (the &quot;no-on&quot;) include avoidance of high-protein meals with levodopa dosing and prevention of &quot;wearing off&quot; episodes; failure or delay of the &quot;on&quot; responses very often occurs after prolonged &quot;wearing off&quot; periods. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Failure of &quot;on&quot; response'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not all dyskinesia requires treatment, as milder dyskinetic movements are remarkably well tolerated by most patients with PD.
