Such involvement may include direct invasion or compression of these structures, as well as non-invasive paraneoplastic effects of NHL. Whereas involvement of the central nervous system (CNS) complicates the course of a significant minority of patients, peripheral nervous system involvement is rare. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-paraneoplastic-syndromes-of-the-nervous-system\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of paraneoplastic syndromes of the nervous system&quot;</a>.) </p><p>NHL can involve the CNS either as the sole area of disease (ie, primary CNS lymphoma) or as secondary spread of systemic disease. Secondary involvement of the CNS by NHL can present in many ways, and rapid control of CNS involvement is necessary to prevent neurologic morbidity and preserve quality of life. As such, clinicians must keep this entity high on their differential diagnosis in patients with NHL presenting with neurologic complaints. The most common manifestations of NHL involvement of the CNS include leptomeningeal disease and parenchymal brain involvement. </p><p>The clinical features and diagnosis of secondary CNS lymphoma will be discussed here. Treatment of secondary CNS lymphoma and primary CNS lymphoma are discussed separately.

Lymphoma cells are thought to enter the CNS by hematogenous spread, direct extension from adjacent bone metastases, or by centripetal growth along neurovascular bundles. It has also been hypothesized that lymphoma cells could spread from retroperitoneal lymph nodes or bone marrow to the leptomeninges via the intervertebral venous plexus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-secondary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], although confirmatory evidence for this mode of spread is lacking.</p><p>Most episodes of CNS involvement by non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) occur in the setting of relapsed disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-secondary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]; however, a significant percentage may have had subclinical CNS involvement at the time of diagnosis. This is suggested by the high rate of CNS involvement within six months of initial therapy in many patients with aggressive NHL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-secondary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In addition, late CNS recurrences of NHL may represent second primary tumors. Support for this hypothesis comes from molecular studies in which immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) rearrangement analysis suggested a separate clonal origin for some CNS tumors arising more than three years after the initial diagnosis of NHL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-secondary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Most data on the mechanism of spread of NHL to the CNS come from studies of varieties of T cell lymphoma with an unusually high rate of extranodal involvement. These malignancies typically express CD56, which is also known as the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-secondary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. NCAM is a member of the immunoglobulin superfamily of cell adhesion molecules; it exhibits homophilic (like-to-like) binding, which allows NCAM molecules to facilitate adhesion among neighboring cells with surface NCAM expression. NCAM is naturally expressed on multiple cell types in the brain, spinal cord, muscle, and hematopoietic tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-secondary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. As such, expression of NCAM may allow these tumor cells to interact with cells in the CNS that also express NCAM. In a series of 46 patients with T-cell lymphoma evaluated during a 12-year period, 24 percent of the tumors were NCAM-positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-secondary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Of these, 36 percent had CNS involvement, compared with 3 percent of NCAM-negative tumors. NCAM-positive tumors had a clear predilection for widespread extra-nodal involvement, with a median survival less than half that of NCAM-negative tumors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leukocyte-endothelial-adhesion-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Leukocyte-endothelial adhesion in the pathogenesis of inflammation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Clues surrounding the migration of NHL to the CNS may also be found by examining the molecular phenotype of normal lymphocytes that migrate to the CNS and how this phenotype differs from that of lymphocytes that do not travel to the CNS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-secondary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. As an example, a study of T lymphocyte trafficking into the subarachnoid space of healthy individuals found that P- and E-selectin expression on endothelial cells in the CNS may be a crucial discrepancy between these lymphocytes and others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-secondary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Whether these data also apply to neoplastic lymphocytes traveling to the healthy CNS is unclear.</p><p>B lymphocytes may also enter the brain even under normal circumstances, although the molecular mechanisms that make this possible have not been fully described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-secondary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL), a B cell-attracting chemokine, CXCL13, may play an important role in lymphocyte retention within the CNS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-secondary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. A subset of patients with PCNSL may have occult systemic disease at presentation that eludes detection by routine staging techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-secondary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This patient population may provide insight into the mechanisms by which lymphoma cells home to the CNS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H171056704\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Central nervous system (CNS) disease is found in a minority of patients at the time of NHL diagnosis, the exact percentage of which differs by histologic subtype. The majority of cases of CNS involvement by non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) occur in the setting of relapsed disease. </p><p>The frequency of CNS involvement in systemic NHL varies depending at least partially upon the aggressiveness of the NHL subtype. Approximately 2 to 10 percent of patients with aggressive subtypes of systemic NHL (eg, diffuse large B cell lymphoma) will experience direct involvement of the CNS at some time during their course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-secondary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/3,12-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,12-18</a>]. The incidence is much higher in highly aggressive NHL (eg, Burkitt <span class=\"nowrap\">lymphoma/leukemia,</span> lymphoblastic lymphoma) and lower in indolent NHL (eg, follicular lymphoma). Peripheral nervous system (PNS) involvement by lymphoma is rare. </p><p>It is unknown whether the risk of CNS relapse has changed as initial treatment of these diseases has evolved. Several retrospective studies have suggested that the incidence may be lower among patients with B cell NHL treated with rituximab-containing therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-secondary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>] or etoposide-containing therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-secondary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/18,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,21</a>]. Other studies have found no difference in the incidence of CNS relapse in the pre- versus post-rituximab era [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-secondary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. </p><p>In addition to histologic subtype, risk factors for invasion of the neuraxis by NHL include the primary site of disease and the extent of bulky disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F54470\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54470 \">table 1</a>). These issues are discussed in the following sections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Histologic subtype</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The histologic subtype of lymphoma is the major risk factor for nervous system involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-secondary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/13,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,16</a>]. The incidence of CNS relapse without CNS prophylaxis ranges from less than 3 percent in patients with indolent subtypes of lymphoma to 50 percent in some patients with highly aggressive NHL subtypes, such as Burkitt lymphoma or lymphoblastic lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-secondary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Although histologic subtype is an indicator of risk for CNS involvement, nearly every lymphoma subtype has been reported to invade the nervous system.

Of the 1220 patients with aggressive NHL, 53 (4.3 percent) developed CNS involvement, 35 of which occurred during the first year after NHL diagnosis. This rate has never been confirmed in a prospectively gathered cohort.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective study of 498 patients with NHL, 30 developed secondary CNS disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-secondary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Twenty-six of the 30 had aggressive or highly aggressive disease.

Although most patients do not have all of these features, an entirely normal CSF examination is uncommon. In particular, the combination of a high protein concentration and lymphocytic pleocytosis is often found without other abnormalities.

Such involvement may include direct invasion or compression of these structures, as well as non-invasive paraneoplastic effects of NHL. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Central nervous system (CNS) disease is found in a minority of patients at the time of NHL diagnosis, the exact percentage of which differs by histologic subtype. The majority of cases of CNS involvement by NHL occur in the setting of relapsed disease within the first year after completion of therapy. (See <a href=\"#H171056704\" class=\"local\">'Incidence and risk factors'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Leptomeningeal metastasis (LM), or lymphomatous meningitis, is the most common nervous system complication of NHL. Patients with LM commonly present with radicular pain, vague back or neck pain, mental status changes, cranial nerve deficits, focal weakness or sensory loss, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> headache. Dysfunction at multiple levels of the neuraxis is common. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Leptomeningeal metastasis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Parenchymal involvement of the brain by NHL has traditionally been considered distinctly less common than leptomeningeal metastases, although the prevalence may be increasing. Presenting complaints include seizures, focal motor or sensory deficits, cranial nerve deficits, or depressed level of consciousness due to elevated intracranial pressure. (See <a href=\"#H14780143\" class=\"local\">'Parenchymal brain metastasis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intramedullary spinal metastases (IM) are a rare manifestation of secondary CNS lymphoma that may develop when a tumor in the subarachnoid space grows along nerve roots into the spinal cord or when there is direct hematogenous tumor spread. (See <a href=\"#H14779758\" class=\"local\">'Intramedullary spinal metastasis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most sensitive imaging technique for detection of central nervous system (CNS) involvement from non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). All patients with suspected CNS disease should undergo brain and spine MRI prior to lumbar puncture. (See <a href=\"#H6052480\" class=\"local\">'Neuroimaging'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of leptomeningeal metastases (LM) is made based upon the pathologic evaluation of a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) interpreted within the clinical context. The CSF sample should be evaluated for cell counts, protein and glucose levels, cytology, flow cytometry, and immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement studies. Flow cytometry may detect cases of LM not found by cytology, and cytology may find cases not identified by flow cytometry. (See <a href=\"#H6053884\" class=\"local\">'Lumbar puncture'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical biopsy is often necessary to confirm the diagnosis of parenchymal brain metastasis. There are no known imaging features that allow NHL metastases to be distinguished from primary brain tumors or metastases from other primary tumors with a high degree of certainty. (See <a href=\"#H85679425\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis includes a variety of conditions that can mimic the clinical presentation or MRI patterns seen in patients with suspected LM from NHL, such as infections, inflammatory processes, late effects of prior therapy, and imaging artifacts.
