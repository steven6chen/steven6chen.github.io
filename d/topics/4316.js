A person in a coma:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Looks like he or she is asleep</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cannot be woken up</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cannot move at will</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does not respond to pain or react when spoken to, touched, or shaken</p><p/><p>People in a coma sometimes twitch, move a hand or finger, or make faces or sounds, but that does not mean they are aware, awake, or in control.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H562954225\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes a coma?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A coma can be caused by anything that disrupts normal brain function. Some of the most common causes include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Head injury</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stroke or bleeding in the brain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brain tumors</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Very low blood sugar or other chemical imbalances in the body</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Poisoning, or drug or alcohol overdose</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lack of oxygen or blood to brain, which could happen if a person's heart stopped or the person almost drowned</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infections such as meningitis or encephalitis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seizures</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H562954240\"><span class=\"h1\">How do doctors find the cause of a coma?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If a person is unconscious, his or her doctors and nurses will do an exam to see how the person responds to touch and pain, and to see how the person's eyes respond to light. Then, they will order tests, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Imaging tests of the brain &ndash; These tests create pictures of the brain and can show if any parts of the brain are damaged. Examples of these tests include CT scans and MRIs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>EEG (which stands for electroencephalogram) &ndash; An EEG measures the electrical activity in the brain. It can measure brain waves and shows whether a person is asleep or unconscious and whether they are having seizures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lumbar puncture (also called a &quot;spinal tap&quot;) &ndash; For this test, a doctor puts a thin needle into the person's lower back and removes a small amount of spinal fluid. Spinal fluid is the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. The spinal fluid goes to the lab for tests.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H562954255\"><span class=\"h1\">How is a coma treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The only way to get a person out of a coma is to reverse the condition that caused it. That is not always possible. If it is possible, it needs to be done right away to prevent death and permanent brain damage.</p><p>When it is not possible to get someone out of a coma, doctors try to at least make sure the person keeps breathing and still has a heartbeat. To do that, they hook the person up to machines that monitor heart rate and breathing. That way, the medical team can respond right away if anything goes wrong. Some people who are in a coma need to be put on a machine that breathes for them.</p><p>People in a coma also:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get medicines to help control basic body functions, such as blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get fed through a thin tube that goes into a vein (called an &quot;IV&quot;) or a stomach tube</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get moved every so often so that they do not develop sores on their body</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have routine blood tests done often, so the doctors and nurses can look for signs of infection or other problems</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have their reflexes and responses to pain checked every so often</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have their temperature checked</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H562954270\"><span class=\"h1\">How long can a coma last?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people who are in a coma come out of it in 2 to 4 weeks. Comas are not permanent and do not usually last more than several weeks. Patients either recover completely or partially, or die.</p><p>Some people with severe brain injury transition from a coma to something called a &quot;persistent vegetative state.&quot; People in a persistent vegetative state have brain activity that suggests they go to sleep and wake up but otherwise seem like they are in a coma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H562954287\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=closed-head-injury-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Closed head injury (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pressure-sores-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pressure sores (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=advance-directives-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Advance directives (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-care-during-advanced-illness-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medical care during advanced illness (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
