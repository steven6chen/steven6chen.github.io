This is usually attributed to the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-salt-wasting/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>].</p><p>Cerebral salt wasting (CSW) is another potential cause of hyponatremia in those with CNS disease, particularly patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage. CSW is characterized by hyponatremia and extracellular fluid depletion due to inappropriate sodium wasting in the urine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-salt-wasting/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, some authorities contend that CSW does not really exist and is only a misnomer for what is actually SIADH, with the putative salt wasting being due to unappreciated volume expansion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-salt-wasting/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>Issues related to CSW, including the differentiation from SIADH, will be reviewed here. The causes and diagnosis of hyponatremia, causes and treatment of SIADH, and the general management of patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hyponatremia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hyponatremia in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-evaluation-of-adults-with-hyponatremia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic evaluation of adults with hyponatremia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-and-etiology-of-the-syndrome-of-inappropriate-antidiuretic-hormone-secretion-siadh\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology and etiology of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hyponatremia-syndrome-of-inappropriate-antidiuretic-hormone-secretion-siadh-and-reset-osmostat\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hyponatremia: Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH) and reset osmostat&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-aneurysmal-subarachnoid-hemorrhage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With respect to pathophysiology, two issues need to be addressed: the mechanism of salt wasting and the mechanism of hyponatremia.</p><p>The mechanism by which cerebral disease might lead to renal salt wasting is poorly understood. Two putative mechanisms are disruption of neural input to the kidney and central elaboration of a circulating natriuretic factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-salt-wasting/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The sympathetic nervous system promotes sodium, uric acid, and water reabsorption in the proximal tubule, as well as renin release. Thus, impaired sympathetic neural input could explain the reductions in proximal sodium and urate reabsorption as well as the impaired release of renin and aldosterone. The failure of serum aldosterone to rise in response to volume depletion would explain the absence of potassium wasting despite the increase in distal sodium delivery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The second theory is that a circulating factor that impairs renal tubular sodium reabsorption is released in patients with brain injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-salt-wasting/abstract/6,10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,10-13</a>]. The primary candidate is brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), which decreases sodium reabsorption and inhibits renin release [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-salt-wasting/abstract/11,12,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12,14</a>]. BNP may also decrease autonomic outflow via effects at the level of the brainstem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-salt-wasting/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. A discussion of the various actions of these hormones is available in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=natriuretic-peptide-measurement-in-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Natriuretic peptide measurement in heart failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>One report suggested that BNP might be the more probable candidate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-salt-wasting/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In this prospective observational study, 10 patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage were compared with a control group of 10 patients who underwent craniotomy for resection of cerebral tumors and 40 controls. The patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage had increases in urine volume and sodium excretion that correlated with a marked significant increase in mean plasma BNP (15.1 versus 1.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">pmol/L</span> in the other two groups) and with the increase in intracranial pressure. The concentration of ANP was normal, while that of aldosterone was reduced, an effect that may be mediated in part by BNP.</p><p>It was suggested that BNP was released from hormone-producing neurons in the brain in response to increased intracranial pressure. Some have speculated that renal salt wasting and the resultant volume depletion is a protective measure, limiting extreme rises in intracranial pressure. In addition, the vasodilatory properties of BNP might decrease the tendency for vasospasm in subarachnoid hemorrhage.</p><p>With respect to the mechanism of hyponatremia, renal salt wasting leads to volume depletion, which provides a baroreceptor stimulus for the release of ADH, thereby impairing the ability of the kidney to elaborate a dilute urine and leading to hyponatremia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hyponatremia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hyponatremia in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-disorders-of-water-balance-hyponatremia-and-hypernatremia-and-sodium-balance-hypovolemia-and-edema\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of disorders of water balance (hyponatremia and hypernatremia) and sodium balance (hypovolemia and edema)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Is cerebral salt wasting real?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some authors have suggested that CSW may not exist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-salt-wasting/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. They contend that most patients who are given a diagnosis of CSW may be excreting excess sodium physiologically, either because of reduced venous capacitance caused by catecholamine-induced vasoconstriction or because of volume expansion with intravenous fluids. As an example, patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage are at risk for cerebral vasospasm that is thought to be precipitated by reduced cerebral blood flow. As a result, they are typically given large volumes of isotonic saline. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-aneurysmal-subarachnoid-hemorrhage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If volume expansion were induced by saline administration, a high rate of sodium excretion would not be an indicator of salt wasting. In a survey of patients admitted to a neurosurgical unit, a positive balance for sodium could be documented in over 90 percent of those believed to have CSW when calculations included all infusions from the time of first contact with medical or paramedical personnel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-salt-wasting/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>However, many authorities feel that CSW is a distinct entity. In the setting of CNS disease, patients with CSW meet the traditional laboratory criteria for SIADH but clearly have decreased extracellular volume due to excessive urinary sodium excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-salt-wasting/abstract/16-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-20</a>]. By comparison, SIADH is associated with a slightly increased or normal extracellular volume.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY AND CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of CSW is unclear, particularly given that its existence is disputed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-salt-wasting/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. Among patients with CNS disease, CSW is a much less common cause of hyponatremia than SIADH.</p><p>Although CSW has been most often described in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage, it accounts for only a small proportion of cases of hyponatremia in these patients (7 percent in one series compared to 69 percent due to SIADH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-salt-wasting/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Furthermore, the frequency of CSW as a cause of hyponatremia in this setting may be diminishing since the usual management of patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage consists of providing large volumes of isotonic saline. In another prospective cohort of 100 patients with acute nontraumatic aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, hyponatremia developed in 49 percent of subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-salt-wasting/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Hyponatremia was attributable to SIADH in 71 percent of patients and to glucocorticoid deficiency in 8 percent. Incorrect choice or insufficient use of fluids or hypovolemia accounted for the remainder of the cases. There were no cases that met the accepted criteria for CSW. This study is noteworthy in that all patients underwent serial assessment of volume status by an experienced clinician along with measurement of plasma cortisol, arginine vasopressin, and brain natriuretic peptide. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-aneurysmal-subarachnoid-hemorrhage#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage&quot;, section on 'Hemodynamic augmentation'</a> and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>CSW has also been reported in patients with carcinomatous or infectious meningitis, encephalitis, poliomyelitis, and central nervous system tumors, as well as following CNS surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-salt-wasting/abstract/5,22-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,22-26</a>]. Rare cases have been described in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-salt-wasting/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with CSW may have moderate or severe hyponatremia. The typical onset of hyponatremia due to CSW is within the first 10 days following a neurosurgical procedure or event. However, case reports have described later onset (eg, one month after transsphenoidal surgery for treatment of a pituitary macroadenoma) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-salt-wasting/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>CSW is associated with extracellular fluid depletion. As a result, hypotension, decreased skin turgor, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an elevated hematocrit may be observed.</p><p>Theoretically, the volume depletion seen with CSW may worsen cerebral perfusion directly, and the associated hypotension may precipitate vasospasm in those with subarachnoid hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-salt-wasting/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. Whether hyponatremia itself potentiates vasospasm is uncertain, but it may worsen cerebral edema and therefore contribute to mental status decline.

A directed history and physical examination and appropriate laboratory tests are essential. The general approach to the diagnosis of hyponatremia is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-evaluation-of-adults-with-hyponatremia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic evaluation of adults with hyponatremia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the setting of CNS disease, CSW is diagnosed in the patient with clinical evidence of hypovolemia who has the following characteristics:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyponatremia (less than 135 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L)</span> with a low plasma osmolality</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An inappropriately elevated urine osmolality (above 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg</span> and usually above 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A urine sodium concentration usually above 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A low serum uric acid concentration due to urate wasting in the urine</p><p/><p>Clinical evidence of hypovolemia is crucial since all of these laboratory findings are also seen in SIADH.</p><p>Given the overlap and the frequent difficulty in determining whether a patient has mild hypovolemia, the diagnosis of CSW should require that volume repletion leads to a dilute urine, which would be due to the removal of the hypovolemic stimulus to ADH release. Excretion of a dilute urine would lead to correction of the hyponatremia.</p><p>Although difficult to perform accurately, evidence of net negative sodium balance prior to therapy is also consistent with the diagnosis of CSW [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-salt-wasting/abstract/6,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,29</a>]. Calculation of the sodium intake includes that obtained via intravenous and oral routes (including sodium supplements and food), while sodium excretion involves frequent measurement of urine sodium concentrations combined with knowledge of urine volumes.</p><p>Formation of a dilute urine with volume repletion has not been demonstrated, and, in many if not most reported cases, clear evidence of hypovolemia has not been present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-salt-wasting/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the setting of CNS injury, CSW must be distinguished from other causes of hyponatremia, principally SIADH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-salt-wasting/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Glucocorticoid deficiency as a cause of increased vasopressin should be excluded in patients with sellar or suprasellar disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-salt-wasting/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].

The hyponatremia is mediated by increased release of ADH, which can be due to any cause of cortisol deficiency or hypoaldosteronism, while hyperkalemia only occurs with primary adrenal disease.

As an example, fluid restriction, the usual first-line therapy for SIADH, may increase the risk of cerebral infarction among patients who actually have CSW since ongoing salt losses might worsen the volume depletion and lower the blood pressure.

If CSW is the sole cause of the hyponatremia, volume repletion would result in the urine osmolality falling below 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg,</span> which, as noted above, has not been documented.

Volume repletion would have little effect on urine osmolality in SIADH since ADH secretion in this disorder is not mediated by hypovolemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-salt-wasting/abstract/8,9,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9,36</a>].</p><p>For patients with documented CSW, salt tablets can be administered once the patients are able to take oral medications. Administration of a mineralocorticoid, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fludrocortisone</a>, can also be used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-salt-wasting/abstract/29,37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,37,38</a>].</p><p>Long-term therapy of CSW is not necessary since CSW tends to be transient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-salt-wasting/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

However, careful monitoring is required since isotonic saline can lower the serum sodium in patients with SIADH.

Regardless of the mechanism, sodium wasting can lead sequentially to volume depletion, increased ADH release, hyponatremia due to the associated water retention, and possibly increased neurologic injury. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some authorities contend that CSW does not exist and that the laboratory findings are due to SIADH. However, we feel that CSW is a distinct entity. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Is cerebral salt wasting real?'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Specific laboratory findings include hyponatremia with a low plasma osmolality, an inappropriately elevated urine osmolality (above 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg</span> and usually above 300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg),</span> a urine sodium concentration above 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L,</span> and a low serum uric acid concentration due to urate wasting in the urine. Since CSW is associated with extracellular fluid depletion, hypotension and decreased skin turgor may also be observed. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CSW mimics all of the laboratory findings in the SIADH. The only clue to the presence of CSW rather than SIADH is clinical evidence of extracellular volume depletion, such as hypotension and decreased skin turgor, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> increased hematocrit, in a patient with a urine sodium concentration above 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L</span>. Unlike SIADH, volume repletion in CSW leads to a dilute urine, due to removal of the hypovolemic stimulus to ADH release, and subsequent correction of the hyponatremia. This finding has not been convincingly demonstrated, which could reflect concurrent SIADH due to the CNS disease. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the setting of CNS disease, accurate distinction between CSW and SIADH is essential since the two disorders are managed differently, with possible adverse consequences if the incorrect therapeutic strategy is administered. In patients with a clinical picture compatible with CSW, we recommend initial therapy with isotonic saline to correct the volume depletion and possibly reverse the hyponatremia. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-salt-wasting/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Hasan D, Wijdicks EF, Vermeulen M.
