It is a rare complication of vaginal or cesarean delivery, but when it occurs, it is a life-threatening obstetrical emergency. If not promptly recognized and treated, uterine inversion can lead to severe hemorrhage and shock, resulting in maternal death.</p><p>Spontaneous inversion of the non-puerperal uterus accounts for approximately 5 percent of all uterine inversions, and will not be addressed by this topic review [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/puerperal-uterine-inversion/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. It is almost always associated with presence of a polypoid uterine tumor, usually a leiomyoma, but other tumors (eg, teratoma, sarcoma) have also been implicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/puerperal-uterine-inversion/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Uterine inversions are classified by the extent of inversion and time of occurrence:</p><p>Extent of inversion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F94756\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef94756 \">figure 1</a>)<strong> </strong>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/puerperal-uterine-inversion/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>1st degree (incomplete) inversion: the fundus is within the endometrial cavity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>2nd degree (complete) inversion: the fundus protrudes through the cervical os</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>3rd degree inversion (uterine prolapse): the fundus protrudes to or beyond the introitus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>4th degree (total uterine and vaginal) inversion: both the uterus and vagina are inverted</p><p/><p>Time of occurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/puerperal-uterine-inversion/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute: within 24 hours of delivery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subacute: more than 24 hours but less than four weeks postpartum</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic: one month or more postpartum</p><p/><p>In a review of 229 cases of puerperal uterine inversion, 83.4 percent were acute, 13.9 percent were chronic, and 2.6 percent were subacute [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/puerperal-uterine-inversion/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Another review including 358 cases suggested 90 percent were complete or prolapsed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/puerperal-uterine-inversion/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The reported incidence of puerperal uterine inversion ranges from 1 in 1200 to 57,000 deliveries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/puerperal-uterine-inversion/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>]. This wide range may be related to differences in definition of inversion, postpartum assessment of the uterus, patient populations, case ascertainment, and routine obstetrical procedures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of uterine inversion is incompletely understood. It has been attributed to use of excessive cord traction and fundal pressure (Cred&eacute; maneuver) during the third stage of labor, especially in the setting of an atonic uterus with fundal implantation of the placenta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/puerperal-uterine-inversion/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. However, evidence is inconsistent and a causal relationship between management of the third stage of labor and puerperal uterine inversion is unproven [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/puerperal-uterine-inversion/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. It is likely that other factors play a role, since spontaneous inversions occur and inversion is rare even though cord traction and the Cred&eacute; maneuver are common.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7109044\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk factors for inversion, which are present in fewer than 50 percent of cases, include fetal macrosomia, rapid or prolonged labor and delivery, short umbilical cord, use of uterine relaxants, nulliparity, uterine anomalies or tumors (leiomyoma), retained placenta, and placenta accreta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/puerperal-uterine-inversion/abstract/10,11,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11,14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7109293\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Puerperal uterine inversion can follow vaginal or cesarean delivery, including inversion through the hysterotomy incision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/puerperal-uterine-inversion/abstract/9,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,15</a>]. The clinical presentation depends on the extent and time of occurrence of the inversion. Signs and symptoms may include mild to severe vaginal bleeding, mild to severe lower abdominal pain, the presence of a smooth, round mass protruding from the cervix or vagina, and possibly urinary retention.</p><p>The most common presentation is complete uterine inversion with severe postpartum hemorrhage, often leading to hypovolemic shock. Shock out of proportion to blood loss has been described and attributed to increased vagal tone from stretching of the pelvic parasympathetic nerves (neurogenic shock), but this is controversial and may just reflect underestimation of blood loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/puerperal-uterine-inversion/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. On vaginal examination, the inverted fundus fills the vagina; on transabdominal palpation, the uterine fundus is absent at its expected periumbilical position. With severe prolapse, the inverted uterus is readily appreciated protruding at the perineum.</p><p>Incomplete uterine inversion occurs in about 10 percent of cases and is associated with more subtle findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/puerperal-uterine-inversion/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In contrast to complete inversion, blood loss may be minimal. Examination through the dilated cervix reveals a mass (ie, fundus) in the uterine cavity; on abdominal examination, a cup-like defect (fundal notch) may be palpated in the area of the normally globular fundus. In the absence of heavy bleeding or careful examination of the fundus, these patients may not be identified for days or weeks. Because of increasing cervical constriction over time, delayed recognition of inversion is more likely to require surgical intervention to replace the uterus, and the uterus may become edematous and infected.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7109096\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultrasound examination of uterine inversion shows an abnormal uterine fundal contour with a homogeneous globular mass (ie, inverted fundus) within the uterus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/puerperal-uterine-inversion/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7109086\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of acute uterine inversion is based upon clinical findings, typically including vaginal bleeding potentially resulting in shock, lower abdominal pain, and the presence of a smooth round mass protruding from the cervix or vagina. On abdominal examination, lack of palpation of a normally positioned fundus is the key finding. (See <a href=\"#H7109293\" class=\"local\">'Patient presentation'</a> above.)</p><p>Radiographic imaging (eg, ultrasound, magnetic resonance) is rarely necessary, but has been used to confirm inversion when the diagnosis was uncertain and the patient was hemodynamically stable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/puerperal-uterine-inversion/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Importantly, in women with significant vaginal bleeding, treatment should not be delayed for radiologic confirmation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common disorder in differential diagnosis is a prolapsed fibroid. Physical and ultrasonographic examination of the fundus help to distinguish the two disorders: the fundus is usually normal with a prolapsed fibroid, whereas with uterine inversion the fundus is absent from its normal position or markedly abnormal (eg, cupped and smaller than expected). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prolapsed-uterine-leiomyoma-fibroid\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prolapsed uterine leiomyoma (fibroid)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management of puerperal uterine inversion is based on clinical experience described in case reports and small retrospective case series, as well as good clinical judgment. No randomized trials have been performed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7110949\"><span class=\"h2\">Goals</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Replace the uterus to its correct position</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Manage postpartum hemorrhage and shock, if present</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prevent recurrent inversion</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial interventions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Interventions for the management of acute uterine inversion should begin promptly and simultaneously. A delay in diagnosis or in prompt initiation of treatment increases the risk of maternal morbidity and mortality. We suggest:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Discontinue uterotonic drugs</strong>, since uterine relaxation is needed for replacement of uterus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Call for immediate assistance</strong>, including anesthesiology staff, additional obstetrical staff (and where appropriate, more experienced obstetrical staff), and operating room personnel. The patient may have to be taken to the operating room if manual replacement of the uterus is unsuccessful.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Establish adequate intravenous access and aggressive fluid resuscitation</strong>. We suggest placement of two large bore intravenous lines (eg, at least one intravenous catheter should be 16-gauge) and begin infusion of crystalloid to support blood pressure. Treat bradycardia due to increased vagal tone with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atropine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atropine</a> (0.5 mg IV). Draw blood for baseline laboratory tests, including a complete blood count and coagulation studies (fibrinogen concentration, prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time). Blood should be administered, as needed, to treat hypovolemia and prevent cardiovascular collapse. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-postpartum-hemorrhage\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of postpartum hemorrhage&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Do not remove the placenta</strong>. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Management of the placenta'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Immediately attempt to manually replace the inverted uterus</strong> to its normal position. This is best accomplished by placing a hand inside the vagina and pushing the fundus along the long axis of the vagina toward the umbilicus (Johnson maneuver) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F94746\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef94746 \">figure 2</a>). Prompt intervention is critical since the lower uterine segment and cervix will contract over time and create a constriction ring, thus making manual replacement progressively more difficult.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If a constriction ring is palpable, pressure should be applied to the part of the fundus nearest the ring to ease it through from bottom to top. This avoids attempting to push a wider diameter of the fundal mass through the ring, which is likely to fail.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Give uterine relaxants</strong> when immediate uterine replacement is unsuccessful, which occurred in one-third of cases in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/puerperal-uterine-inversion/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Manual replacement is then reattempted.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Nitroglycerin</a> (glyceryl trinitrate) is an excellent uterine relaxant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/puerperal-uterine-inversion/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]; we suggest 50 micrograms administered intravenously, followed by up to four additional doses of 50 micrograms, as needed to achieve adequate uterine relaxation for replacement. Nitroglycerin has an extremely short half-life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/puerperal-uterine-inversion/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], which could be advantageous in women with severe hemorrhage and hemodynamic instability.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=terbutaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Terbutaline</a> (0.25 milligrams intravenously or subcutaneously) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnesium-sulfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">magnesium sulfate</a> (4 to 6 grams intravenously over 15 to 20 minutes) are other options for uterine relaxation. Magnesium sulfate has a slow onset of action, both drugs have relatively mild effects on the myometrium, but both are acceptable if other agents are not available or if the practitioner is unfamiliar with their use.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Inhalational anesthetic agents, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sevoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sevoflurane</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desflurane</a>,&nbsp;and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoflurane</a>, are also excellent uterine relaxants and may allow uterine replacement without surgical intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/puerperal-uterine-inversion/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Halothane and enflurane are also effective, but these drugs are not used in adults in the United States because of concerns about serious side effects (eg, halothane-related hepatotoxicity), but may be used in some countries with limited resources because of their low cost. The use of all of these drugs requires controlling the maternal airway (intubation). Therefore, inhalational anesthetic agents are best administered in the operating room as an initial step before proceeding to laparotomy for correction of an otherwise refractory uterine inversion. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Secondary (surgical) interventions'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Secondary (surgical) interventions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the above measures to replace the uterus fail, then the patient should be taken promptly to the operating room to attempt surgical correction of the inversion.</p><p>At laparotomy, in place of the uterus, a constriction ring containing a dimple or cup is often observed and the adnexa (ovaries, fallopian tubes, round ligaments) are typically pulled into this depression. We prefer to start with the Huntington procedure because it is less invasive than incision of the constriction ring.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Huntington procedure</strong> &ndash; The cup formed by the inversion is located. A clamp, such as an Allis or Babcock clamp, is placed on each round ligament entering the cup, about 2 cm deep in the cup. Gently pulling on the clamps exerts upward traction on the inverted fundus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F94745\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef94745 \">figure 3</a>). Clamping and traction are repeated until the inversion is corrected. The myometrium can be clamped if the round ligaments cannot be identified. This procedure is similar to the hand-over-hand movements used when pulling up an anchor line. If available, a second operator with a hand in the vagina can apply upward pressure on the fundus to facilitate the procedure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Haultain procedure</strong> &ndash; The Haultain procedure involves making an incision in the posterior surface of the uterus to bisect the constriction ring, and thus increase its size (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F94758\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef94758 \">figure 4</a>). Surgical release of the constriction ring should allow manual reduction of the uterine inversion or the inversion can be corrected using the Huntington procedure described above, followed by repair of the incision. We prefer a posterior incision to an anterior incision (Ocejo incision) to reduce the risk of accidental cystotomy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other</strong> &ndash; Other techniques require further investigation of safety and efficacy before they can be recommended. Successful laparoscopic-assisted reduction of acute and chronic uterine inversion has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/puerperal-uterine-inversion/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. Another method used an obstetric vacuum device (ventouse) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/puerperal-uterine-inversion/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2358745672\"><span class=\"h2\">Other options</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2358745678\"><span class=\"h3\">Hydrostatic reduction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hydrostatic reduction of acute uterine inversion is an option if all other interventions have failed and surgical intervention is not possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/puerperal-uterine-inversion/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. The patient is placed in reversed Trendelenburg lithotomy position. A bag of warmed fluid is hung at least one meter above the patient and allowed to flow by gravity or with light pressure through tubing connected to a silastic ventouse cup in the vagina; the seal between the perimeter of the cup and the vagina prevents significant leakage. The resulting intravaginal hydrostatic pressure may force the inverted fundus back to its normal position (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F94757\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef94757 \">figure 5</a>). Two to 5 liters of fluid may be needed. The author has no experience with this procedure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2358745625\"><span class=\"h3\">Vaginal surgical approaches</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vaginal surgical approaches are rarely performed. Transvaginally, the cervical constriction ring is incised posteriorly (Cascarides procedure) or anteriorly (Spinelli procedure), which should allow the uterus to be repositioned manually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/puerperal-uterine-inversion/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The incision is then repaired. Incidental cystotomy is a hazard of the anterior approach.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Management of the placenta</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The author does not remove the placenta until the uterus has been replaced. Removing the placenta before replacing the uterus increases blood loss, which may be severe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/puerperal-uterine-inversion/abstract/10,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,31</a>]. Leaving the placenta in situ rarely interferes with the operator's ability to restore the uterus to its normal position, provided that the patient has appropriate anesthesia. After the uterus has been replaced, the most conservative approach is to await spontaneous separation of the placenta, and performing manual extraction for usual obstetric indications (eg, hemorrhage, prolonged third stage).</p><p>Alternatively, one may attempt manual removal, provided that the patient has appropriate anesthesia and is hemodynamically stable. Manual removal should be performed in an operating room so that surgical intervention can be undertaken if complications occur. A hand is placed into the vagina, through the cervix, and into the uterine cavity. The operator then attempts to develop a cleavage plane between the placenta and uterine wall. If this cannot be accomplished easily, or if bleeding increases, a repeat attempt can be supplemented with sponge-stick curettage or suction curettage. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=retained-placenta-after-vaginal-birth\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Retained placenta after vaginal birth&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If the placenta remains attached, the possibility of placenta accreta should be considered. Risk factors, diagnosis, and treatment of placenta accreta are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-placenta-accreta-spectrum-placenta-accreta-increta-and-percreta\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of placenta accreta spectrum (placenta accreta, increta, and percreta)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Management after correction of inversion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Atony is common after restoration of the normal uterine position. Once placental removal has been successfully accomplished, uterotonic agents are administered to induce myometrial contraction and maintain uterine involution, thereby impeding reinversion and reducing the risk of hemorrhage. The fundus should be held in place and then monitored until the surgeon is sure that the uterus is firm and its position is stable. The fundus can be held in place with the clinician&rsquo;s hand(s) placed internally, externally, or both.</p><p>An <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a> infusion (20 to 40 units in 1 liter of crystalloid infused at 150 to 200 mL per hour) is usually sufficient to keep the uterus contracted.

In other case reports, an intrauterine balloon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/puerperal-uterine-inversion/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>] or uterine compression sutures were used to treat postpartum hemorrhage and prevent recurrent uterine inversion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/puerperal-uterine-inversion/abstract/38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-40</a>]. For example, the Matsubara-Yano compression suture consists of two longitudinal sutures and two transverse sutures: the longitudinal compression sutures extend from the lower uterine segment to the fundus and penetrate the fundal edge; the transverse compression sutures are placed perpendicular to and across the longitudinal sutures to prevent them from sliding off or migrating to the middle of the uterine fundus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F95455\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef95455 \">figure 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/puerperal-uterine-inversion/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

If not promptly recognized and treated, it can lead to severe hemorrhage and shock, resulting in maternal death. (See <a href=\"#H7109293\" class=\"local\">'Patient presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Uterine inversions are classified in terms of the extent and timing of the inversion. Most inversions are acute and complete. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Uterine inversion has been attributed to excessive cord traction and fundal pressure (Cred&eacute; maneuver) during the third stage of labor, especially in the setting of a uterine atony and fundal implantation of the placenta. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of acute uterine inversion is based upon clinical findings, typically including vaginal bleeding potentially resulting in shock, lower abdominal pain, and the presence of a smooth, round mass protruding from the cervix or vagina. On abdominal examination, lack of palpation of a normally positioned fundus is the key finding. (See <a href=\"#H7109086\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F94755\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef94755 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial interventions for management of uterine inversion should be applied rapidly: summon help, discontinue uterotonic drugs, administer crystalloid aggressively and blood products (as needed), and attempt to manually reposition the uterus by pushing the fundus cephalad along the long axis of the vagina. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Initial interventions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the placenta is attached to an inverted uterus, we suggest leaving it in place rather than extracting it before replacing the uterus (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Placental extraction may increase hemorrhage. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Management of the placenta'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the initial attempt at manual uterine replacement is unsuccessful, we administer a uterine relaxant and reattempt reduction of the inversion. We suggest nitroglycerine over other uterine relaxants (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). It is highly effective and has a short duration of action. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Initial interventions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical intervention is required if manual replacement remains unsuccessful after administering a uterine relaxant. We suggest the Huntington rather than the Haultain procedure (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>), given the former does not require incising the uterus. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Secondary (surgical) interventions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A uterotonic agent is administered after uterine replacement to induce myometrial contraction, maintain uterine involution, and prevent reinversion. We use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a> because of its rapid action, short half-life, familiarity to personnel on labor and delivery units, and relative lack of side effects in virtually all patients. However, any standard uterotonic drug is acceptable, provided there are no medical contraindications to its use, such as hypertension (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylergonovine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylergonovine</a>) or reactive airway disease (carboprost). In the absence of any medical contraindications, we suggest, in order of preference, oxytocin, carboprost (Hemabate), or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> (Cytotec), and we employ methylergonovine <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dinoprostone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dinoprostone</a> as second-line agents.
