Skin involvement is common, and mucosal, hair, or nail abnormalities may also occur. Because these disorders share clinical and histopathologic features with a variety of other skin diseases, thorough consideration of the differential diagnosis is essential for the management of post-HCT patients with lesions suggestive of cutaneous GVHD.</p><p>The clinical and histopathologic features, differential diagnosis, and supportive therapy of cutaneous GVHD will be reviewed here. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of acute and chronic GVHD are reviewed in greater detail separately.

Cutaneous involvement is often the earliest manifestation of acute GVHD; skin lesions frequently appear within two to four weeks of HCT but may occur any time after hematopoietic cell engraftment.

The presence of erythroderma and bullae is sufficient to diagnose grade 4 GVHD, and is associated with a poor prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-manifestations-of-graft-versus-host-disease-gvhd/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

However, relatively little is known about oral acute GVHD due to difficulty in distinguishing this disorder from mucositis secondary to chemotherapy administered in preparation for HCT. Some authors have suggested that lesions that persist for longer than three weeks after HCT or involve the hard palate (an uncommon site for chemotherapy-induced mucositis) may be more likely to represent acute GVHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-manifestations-of-graft-versus-host-disease-gvhd/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Correlation between clinical and pathologic findings is essential.

Apoptotic keratinocytes may also be present in the follicular epithelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-manifestations-of-graft-versus-host-disease-gvhd/abstract/4,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,10</a>] &#160;</p><p>The lymphocytic infiltrate can be sparse and perivascular or more extensive. Migration of lymphocytes into the epidermis (lymphocyte exocytosis) is common. The presence of satellite cell necrosis (two or more lymphocytes surrounding an apoptotic keratinocyte) also supports a diagnosis of acute GVHD. Fulminant lesions demonstrate subepidermal clefting and full-thickness necrosis of the epidermis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-manifestations-of-graft-versus-host-disease-gvhd/abstract/4,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,10</a>].</p><p>The criteria often used for categorizing the histopathologic findings in acute GVHD are as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-manifestations-of-graft-versus-host-disease-gvhd/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Grade 0 </strong>&ndash; normal skin or changes not referable to GVHD</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Grade 1 </strong>&ndash; vacuolization of the basal layer at the dermal-epidermal junction</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Grade 2 </strong>&ndash; Basal layer vacuolization, necrotic epidermal cells, lymphocytic infiltrate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F61055\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61055 \">picture 4</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Grade 3 </strong>&ndash; Grade 2 changes plus cleft formation at the dermal-epidermal junction</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Grade 4 </strong>&ndash; Grade 2 changes plus separation of the epidermis from the dermis</p><p/><p>The sensitivity and specificity of skin biopsy for acute GVHD has not been definitively established. In general, a diagnosis of acute cutaneous GVHD is supported by the appearance of a consistent cutaneous eruption occurring in a time period that correlates with the return of lymphocytes to the peripheral circulation (lymphocyte recovery) and at least grade 2 changes on histopathologic examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-manifestations-of-graft-versus-host-disease-gvhd/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Biopsies taken early in the course of GVHD may reveal nondiagnostic findings. In one retrospective study of 40 biopsy specimens from 38 patients with skin eruptions taken between 3 and 21 days after HCT, the histopathologic findings were nonspecific in all cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-manifestations-of-graft-versus-host-disease-gvhd/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>In addition, it is unclear whether skin biopsies influence the decision to treat or affect disease outcomes in patients with acute GVHD. Thus, the value of performing a skin biopsy, particularly early in the course of acute GVHD, has been questioned by some authors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-manifestations-of-graft-versus-host-disease-gvhd/abstract/14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-17</a>]. Few studies have investigated the role of skin biopsies. The following studies found little evidence in support of this procedure:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective study of 187 patients who had received allogenic HCT within the preceding 30 days found that the results of skin biopsies (performed in 51 patients who developed skin eruptions suggestive of GVHD) did not influence the likelihood of patients to receive treatment. In addition, skin biopsy results failed to correlate with clinical severity of skin disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-manifestations-of-graft-versus-host-disease-gvhd/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective study of patients who were status post allogenic HCT, 98 skin biopsies from 71 patients with clinical grade 2 or higher acute GVHD were compared to 81 biopsies from 66 patients who did not progress to clinically significant acute GVHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-manifestations-of-graft-versus-host-disease-gvhd/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. No single histopathologic finding was found to be a statistically significant diagnostic indicator of GVHD. The authors concluded that biopsies were of limited use for determining which patients will progress to grade 2 or higher GVHD. </p><p/><p>Despite the lack of strong evidence to support performing a skin biopsy in patients with suspected GVHD, a biopsy may provide information that can be used in conjunction with other clinical findings to support a diagnosis of acute GVHD or to establish an alternative cause of the skin eruption. Due to the relative safety of skin biopsy procedures and the known risks associated with immunosuppressive therapy used in the management of acute GVHD, many clinicians, including ourselves, continue to perform skin biopsies in post-HCT patients with skin eruptions for which the differential diagnosis includes acute GVHD. Additional studies are necessary to investigate the utility of skin biopsy in the management of acute GVHD and the most appropriate setting and timing for skin biopsy. Potential adverse effects of skin biopsy include minor bleeding, infection, and scarring.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H733005\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple other disorders may present with clinical or histopathologic features that resemble acute GVHD. The following conditions should be considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-manifestations-of-graft-versus-host-disease-gvhd/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Drug eruptions </strong>&ndash; Differentiation of acute GVHD from a drug eruption may not be possible (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F54205\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54205 \">picture 5</a>). Morbilliform drug reactions typically develop 7 to 10 days after first exposure to the inciting medication; however, more rapid onset (within one to two days) may occur upon re-exposure to an offending agent. Unlike GVHD, which most commonly starts on the head, neck, and acral sites, morbilliform drug reactions typically begin on the torso and spread over several days to involve the lower extremities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-manifestations-of-graft-versus-host-disease-gvhd/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Although the presence of eosinophils on biopsy is often associated with drug eruptions, the presence of eosinophils does not rule out GVHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-manifestations-of-graft-versus-host-disease-gvhd/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

Phototoxic drug eruptions secondary to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a> may also be mistaken for GVHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-manifestations-of-graft-versus-host-disease-gvhd/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Viral exanthems </strong>&ndash; Viral infections (eg, HHV-6, HHV-7, cytomegalovirus, others) can induce maculopapular or morbilliform eruptions in post-HCT patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F58169\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58169 \">picture 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-manifestations-of-graft-versus-host-disease-gvhd/abstract/2,8,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8,22</a>]. Skin biopsy specimens secondary to viral exanthems often demonstrate sparse perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates.

Unlike GVHD, gastrointestinal and hepatic abnormalities do not occur.

Morpheaform lesions demonstrate thickened collagen bundles in the dermis with loss of adnexal structures, and in the absence of epidermal changes, may be indistinguishable from specimens from true morphea or systemic sclerosis. As in these other disorders, specimens from lesions of sclerotic chronic GVHD often have a square or &quot;box car&quot; shape to the biopsy. Sclerotic GVHD involving the subcutaneous tissue demonstrates a lymphocytic infiltrate near the interface of dermis and fat with thickening of the septae. </p><p/><p>A 4 mm punch biopsy is sufficient for the evaluation of lichen planus-like, lichen sclerosus-like, and most morpheaform lesions.

Cutaneous manifestations commonly occur in both acute and chronic GVHD. (See <a href=\"#H3496485\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2692898\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute GVHD usually begins with erythematous macules on the ears, palms, soles, neck, face, or upper back. Lesions subsequently become more generalized; severe cases exhibit erythroderma, bullae, and extensive epidermal necrosis. Little is known about oral involvement in acute GVHD. (See <a href=\"#H18902811\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Characteristic histopathologic findings in acute GVHD include vacuolization of the basal layer of the epidermis, a sparse lymphocytic dermal infiltrate, and apoptotic keratinocytes. Advanced lesions demonstrate subepidermal clefts and extensive epidermal necrosis. (See <a href=\"#H18902827\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The value of skin biopsy in acute GVHD has been questioned. Biopsies can yield nonspecific results. In all cases, histopathologic findings require clinical correlation for proper interpretation. (See <a href=\"#H18902827\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A variety of disorders, including drug eruptions, viral exanthems, and toxic epidermolytic necrosis share clinical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> histopathologic features with acute cutaneous GVHD. The possibility of other disorders must be considered in hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients who present with clinical or histopathologic findings suggestive of acute cutaneous GVHD. (See <a href=\"#H733005\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic GVHD presents in a number of different morphologies involving the epidermis, dermis, or subcutaneous tissues. Lichen planus-like lesions resemble the dermatologic disease lichen planus, whereas sclerotic involvement may resemble morphea, lichen sclerosus, or eosinophilic fasciitis. Dyspigmentation and other cutaneous, hair, or nail abnormalities have been associated with chronic GVHD. Oral involvement is common. (See <a href=\"#H2692996\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with chronic GVHD may benefit from the use of emollients, topical or systemic antipruritic agents, or topical corticosteroids. Patients should also be followed closely for the development of cutaneous or oral squamous cell carcinoma. Agents to reduce oral pain or xerostomia are useful. (See <a href=\"#H3496567\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cutaneous-manifestations-of-graft-versus-host-disease-gvhd/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Filipovich AH, Weisdorf D, Pavletic S, et al.
