Tympanostomy tube insertion rates are high in other developed countries as well. In Denmark, approximately 30 percent of children undergo at least one ventilation tube insertion by their fifth birthday [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tympanostomy-tube-placement-postoperative-care-and-complications-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>The rate of tympanostomy tube placement is higher in children who attend daycare. Children with autism spectrum disorder <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> developmental delay also undergo tube insertion at a higher rate, possibly because of a lower threshold to perform the surgery in children at greater risk for speech delay or protracted ear difficulties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tympanostomy-tube-placement-postoperative-care-and-complications-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In addition, children with craniofacial anomalies, such as cleft palate or trisomy 21, are more likely to have dysfunction of the eustachian tube leading to the development of otitis media, with a subsequent increased risk for tympanostomy tube placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tympanostomy-tube-placement-postoperative-care-and-complications-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

The ventilating function of the eustachian tube is less well developed in young children than in adults. Underventilation of the middle ear results in negative pressure that may lead to aspiration of nasopharyngeal secretions and transudation of intracellular fluid, important steps in the development of acute otitis media (AOM) and otitis media with effusion (OME, also called serous otitis media) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tympanostomy-tube-placement-postoperative-care-and-complications-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Unfortunately, simple perforations of the TM close rapidly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tympanostomy-tube-placement-postoperative-care-and-complications-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In the early 1900s, various materials (eg, catgut, fish bones, lead wires, and gold rings) were used in efforts to keep the perforations open [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tympanostomy-tube-placement-postoperative-care-and-complications-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Successful ventilation of the middle ear by myringotomy and insertion of a straight, narrow polyethylene tube that remained in place for a few weeks was described in a series of patients in 1954 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tympanostomy-tube-placement-postoperative-care-and-complications-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The initial tube design has been modified since then to achieve greater duration of function and lower rates of permanent perforation after extrusion.</p><p>The small, approximately 1 mm opening in the tympanostomy tube prevents the development of negative pressure in the middle ear. The tube does not &quot;cure&quot; otitis media, but bypasses the child's immature and poorly functioning eustachian tube to equalize middle ear and atmospheric pressures. Tympanostomy tubes also allow administration of antibiotics to the middle ear topically. Tympanostomy tubes are sometimes called &quot;pressure-equalizing (PE) tubes&quot; or &quot;ventilation tubes.&quot; Relapse of AOM or OME when a tube extrudes or is obstructed reflects persistent inadequate function of the child's eustachian tube and should not be interpreted as a surgical &quot;failure&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tympanostomy-tube-placement-postoperative-care-and-complications-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR PATIENT SELECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tympanostomy tubes are indicated when long-term ventilation of the middle ear space is desired [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tympanostomy-tube-placement-postoperative-care-and-complications-in-children/abstract/2,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,11</a>]. Tympanostomy tubes are used to control conductive hearing loss associated with middle ear effusion (MEE), control recurrent acute otitis media (AOM), and prevent acquired cholesteatoma due to a retraction pocket of the tympanic membrane (TM). Specific indications for tympanostomy tubes and comparison of tympanostomy tubes with prophylactic antibiotic therapy in children with otitis media with effusion (OME) and recurrent AOM are discussed separately.

The tube materials available (metal, plastic, or ceramic) all seem to have similar efficacy. Caregivers should be educated with regard to the expected duration of tube function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tympanostomy-tube-placement-postoperative-care-and-complications-in-children/abstract/2,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7729806\"><span class=\"h2\">Short versus long term</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The duration of tympanostomy tube function is largely dependent on tube design and placement. There are two general types of tympanostomy tubes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Short-term tubes (grommet tubes), intended to remain in the tympanic membrane (TM) for 4 to 18 months, have flanges on the inner and outer surfaces, which span the eardrum on either side and hold the tube in place (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71781\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71781 \">picture 1</a>). Grommet tubes with right angles or beveled flanges (Armstrong-type tubes) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71781\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71781 \">picture 1</a>) normally last approximately 13 months, with 95 percent extruding between 6 and 18 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tympanostomy-tube-placement-postoperative-care-and-complications-in-children/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>] (see <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Tube extrusion'</a> below). Shepard-type grommets with an hourglass shape extrude sooner, after a mean duration of approximately eight months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tympanostomy-tube-placement-postoperative-care-and-complications-in-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long-term tubes (T-tubes), intended to remain in the TM for more than 15 months, have shafts that are too long to fit in the middle ear (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F68480\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68480 \">picture 2</a>). These tubes frequently require active removal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tympanostomy-tube-placement-postoperative-care-and-complications-in-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>] (see <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Tube removal'</a> below). Implantation of tympanostomy tubes beneath the tympanic annulus provides very long-term ventilation (median 35 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tympanostomy-tube-placement-postoperative-care-and-complications-in-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p>In theory, the prolonged ventilation provided by a long-term tube is desirable. However, only 30 to 40 percent of children initially treated with short-term tubes require additional tubes or surgery for otitis media. In addition, long-term tubes are associated with higher rates of otorrhea and persistent perforation of the TM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tympanostomy-tube-placement-postoperative-care-and-complications-in-children/abstract/17,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,21,22</a>]. Thus, short-term tubes are recommended for most children. </p><p>Indications for long-term tubes include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weakened or atelectatic TMs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Previous early extrusion of grommet tubes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Expected need for many years of ventilation (eg, adolescents with a long history of Eustachian tube dysfunction). </p><p/><p>T-tubes are relatively painless to remove in the office, especially if the inner flanges are trimmed. They may be a good choice for short-term ventilation in an older child who needs winter ventilation but desires to be free of tubes during the summer swimming season. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Tube otorrhea'</a> below and <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Persistent perforation'</a> below.)</p><p>Earlier extrusion of all types may occur when tubes are inserted into TMs that have been previously intubated, or have been weakened focally by atrophy or atelectasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tympanostomy-tube-placement-postoperative-care-and-complications-in-children/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7729812\"><span class=\"h2\">Tube materials</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tympanostomy tube materials are selected for maximum biocompatibility and resistance to clogging and extrusion. The materials, in general order of frequency of use, include plastics (polytetrafluoroethylene [fluoroplastic or Teflon], silicone elastomer [Silastic]), metals (stainless steel, titanium, gold), and calcium phosphate-based ceramic (hydroxylapatite) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tympanostomy-tube-placement-postoperative-care-and-complications-in-children/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

No single material has proven superior to the others, although metal tubes, particularly steel, have a greater tendency to clog than tubes made from other materials. Fluoroplastic tubes have been used in most studies of tube safety and efficacy.</p><p>A variety of modifications have been proposed that are of uncertain value.

The best results are achieved when the child has been free of active middle ear disease for one year, to avoid having to reintubate a TM that has been grafted successfully [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tympanostomy-tube-placement-postoperative-care-and-complications-in-children/abstract/81-83\" class=\"abstract_t\">81-83</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h2\">Tympanosclerosis (myringosclerosis)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tympanostomy tubes are associated with structural changes of the TM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tympanostomy-tube-placement-postoperative-care-and-complications-in-children/abstract/84,85\" class=\"abstract_t\">84,85</a>]. Approximately 32 percent of TMs (range 7 to 64 percent) develop asymptomatic whitish plaques of calcium and phosphate crystals (tympanosclerosis) after tube extrusion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F58460\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58460 \">picture 12</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tympanostomy-tube-placement-postoperative-care-and-complications-in-children/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. For every 3.3 children who receive tubes, one additional case of tympanosclerosis occurs compared with children with recurrent otitis media who do not receive tympanostomy tubes. The plaques may be localized or diffuse and are of uncertain etiology. Boys are affected more often than girls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tympanostomy-tube-placement-postoperative-care-and-complications-in-children/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>] and larger plaques are associated with multiple intubations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tympanostomy-tube-placement-postoperative-care-and-complications-in-children/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>].</p><p>The diagnosis of tympanosclerosis is made clinically. Otoscopy demonstrates whitish plaques on the TM (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F58460\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58460 \">picture 12</a>). Pneumatic otoscopy may demonstrate decreased or absent mobility. The plaques are firm and contained within the middle layer of the drum, unlike cholesteatomas, which are soft and occupy the middle ear space. Otomicroscopy with palpation or computed tomography may be necessary to differentiate these disorders.</p><p>Tympanosclerosis associated with tympanostomy tube placement rarely requires treatment. Although the plaques that occur after tube extrusion may cause hearing loss if they involve the ossicles, this phenomenon is not common in the United States and Europe. The hearing impairment caused by tympanosclerosis involving the ear drum alone is &lt;0.5 dB, which is inconsequential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tympanostomy-tube-placement-postoperative-care-and-complications-in-children/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h2\">Focal atrophy of TM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After a tympanostomy tube has extruded, the resultant perforation (approximately 1 to 2 mm diameter) heals as a dimer composed of only the squamous and mucosal layers of the TM (the middle fibrous layer of the TM does not regenerate) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tympanostomy-tube-placement-postoperative-care-and-complications-in-children/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>].

Generalized atrophy or TM collapse (atelectasis) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78843\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78843 \">picture 13</a>) is caused by poor eustachian tube function, not by prior intubation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h2\">Cholesteatoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A cholesteatoma is an accumulation of desquamating epithelium within the middle ear that may grow to envelop the ossicles and result in conductive hearing loss and destruction of the ossicular chain. The placement of tympanostomy tubes may have an overall protective effect on cholesteatoma formation in children with recurrent AOM, because acquired cholesteatoma is a complication of recurrent AOM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tympanostomy-tube-placement-postoperative-care-and-complications-in-children/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>].

The risk of cholesteatoma formation is increased with long-term tubes compared with short-term tubes. In one meta-analysis of tympanostomy tube sequelae, cholesteatoma occurred in 0.8 percent of children with short-term tubes and 1.4 percent of children with long-term tubes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tympanostomy-tube-placement-postoperative-care-and-complications-in-children/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. In a large retrospective cohort, cholesteatoma occurred in 1 percent of children who underwent tympanostomy tube insertion. The risk of cholesteatoma was increased in children who underwent multiple tympanostomy tube insertions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tympanostomy-tube-placement-postoperative-care-and-complications-in-children/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>].</p><p>Retraction pockets are the first step in the genesis of an acquired cholesteatoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F82650\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82650 \">picture 10</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tympanostomy-tube-placement-postoperative-care-and-complications-in-children/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>].
