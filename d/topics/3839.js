The pathogenesis and treatment of this disorder and the characteristics of the other forms of diabetic neuropathy are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-prevention-of-diabetic-polyneuropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and prevention of diabetic polyneuropathy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-diabetic-neuropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of diabetic neuropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diabetic polyneuropathy is primarily a symmetrical sensory polyneuropathy, initially affecting the distal lower extremities. Ten to 18 percent of patients have evidence of nerve damage at the time their diabetes is diagnosed, suggesting that even early impairment of glucose handling, classified as prediabetes, is associated with neuropathy. With disease progression, sensory loss ascends and, when reaching approximately mid-calf, appears in the hands. This gradual evolution causes the typical &quot;stocking-glove&quot; sensory loss. This pattern reflects preferential damage according to axon length; the longest axons are affected first. Motor involvement with frank weakness occurs in the same pattern, but only later and in more severe cases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms and signs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The earliest signs of diabetic polyneuropathy probably reflect the gradual loss of integrity of both large myelinated and small myelinated and unmyelinated nerve fibers:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loss of vibratory sensation and altered proprioception reflect large-fiber loss</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impairment of pain, light touch, and temperature is secondary to loss of small fibers</p><p/><p>Decreased or absent ankle reflexes occur early in the disease, while more widespread loss of reflexes and motor weakness are late findings.</p><p>Patients with prediabetes (defined by the American Diabetes Association as a fasting glucose of 100 to 125 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [5.6 to 6.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L]</span> or a two-hour serum glucose between 140 and 199 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [7.8 and 11.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L]</span> on an oral glucose tolerance test) may present with intensely painful feet. Patients with frank diabetic polyneuropathy may also present with pain, paresthesias, or dysesthesias of their feet. Some patients, however, have few complaints but the physical examination reveals mild to moderately severe sensory loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-diabetic-polyneuropathy/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diabetic polyneuropathy is frequently insidious in onset and can lead to formation of foot ulcers and muscle and joint disease. Progressive sensory loss predisposes to ulcer formation. Foot ulcers are usually classified into two groups: acute ulcers secondary to dermal abrasion from poorly fitting shoes and chronic plantar ulcers occurring over weight-bearing areas. Chronic ulceration is probably multifactorial, due to a combination of diabetic neuropathy (with decreased pain sensation), autonomic dysfunction, and vascular insufficiency. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-diabetic-foot\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the diabetic foot&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Distal motor axonal loss results in atrophy of intrinsic foot muscles and an imbalance between strength in toe extensors and flexors. This ultimately leads to chronic metatarsal-phalangeal flexion (claw-toe deformity) which shifts weight to the metatarsal heads [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-diabetic-polyneuropathy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This weight shift results in formation of calluses that can fissure, become infected and ulcerate. There may also be other arthropathic changes including collapse of the arch of the midfoot and bony prominences, leading to Charcot arthropathy, fragmentation and sclerosis of bone, new bone formation, subluxation, dislocation, and stress fractures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diabetic-neuropathic-arthropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diabetic neuropathic arthropathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Natural history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rationale for regular monitoring (see <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> below) is the observation that the incidence of diabetic neuropathy (and other microvascular and macrovascular complications) increases over time. This was illustrated by a study from Finland that evaluated the natural history of peripheral neuropathy in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-diabetic-polyneuropathy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Polyneuropathy was diagnosed on the basis of both clinical (pain and paresthesia) and electrodiagnostic (nerve conduction velocity and response-amplitude values) criteria. The prevalence of definite or probable polyneuropathy progressively increased from 8.3 percent at baseline to 41.9 percent at 10 years; comparable values in normal subjects were 2.1 and 5.8 percent, respectively.</p><p>In a later population-based study from Australia that evaluated patients with type 2 diabetes who had an average disease duration of about eight years, the prevalence of painful diabetic polyneuropathy was 26.4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-diabetic-polyneuropathy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CRITERIA FOR DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The discussion that follows regarding the diagnosis of diabetic polyneuropathy applies primarily to patients with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. An overview of the diagnostic approach to suspected polyneuropathy in patients without diabetes or in those who have not yet been evaluated for diabetes is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-polyneuropathy#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of polyneuropathy&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>Historically, the diagnosis of diabetic polyneuropathy was based on subjective interpretation of a constellation of symptoms and signs such as loss of vibratory or light touch sensation and reduced or absent ankle reflexes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-diabetic-polyneuropathy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In 1988, a group of diabetologists and neurologists proposed a comprehensive set of criteria, the San Antonio Consensus statement, to diagnose and monitor diabetic neuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-diabetic-polyneuropathy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Using similar symptom scores, quantitative examination, and electrophysiologic measurements, investigators at the Mayo Clinic placed patients in one of three classes of diabetic neuropathy.</p><p>In 2005, an expert panel developed a case definition of distal symmetric polyneuropathy; most of the supporting evidence came from studies involving patients with diabetic polyneuropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-diabetic-polyneuropathy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. This polyneuropathy definition is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-polyneuropathy#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of polyneuropathy&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis of polyneuropathy'</a>.)</p><p>A third consensus panel convened in Toronto in 2009 and advocated that, for controlled clinical trials and epidemiologic studies of diabetic neuropathy, nerve conduction studies are needed for accurate assessment, and are coupled with assessments of symptoms and signs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-diabetic-polyneuropathy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Screening tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The San Antonio Consensus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-diabetic-polyneuropathy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], the Mayo Clinic criteria and the Toronto criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-diabetic-polyneuropathy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] are thorough and appropriate for research purposes. However, they are not practical in routine clinical practice. The need to identify simplified criteria has resulted in the development of several simple screening tests. Two will be discussed: one from the United Kingdom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-diabetic-polyneuropathy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>] and one which we developed at Michigan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-diabetic-polyneuropathy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. These simple tools used to diagnose diabetic neuropathy do <strong>not</strong> include electrodiagnostic assessments with nerve conduction studies or quantitative sensory testing. These are discussed later. (See <a href=\"#H114901971\" class=\"local\">'Electrodiagnostic tests'</a> below.)</p><p>Accurate assessment of symptoms in diabetic polyneuropathy is known to be difficult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-diabetic-polyneuropathy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In developing the Michigan Neuropathy Screening Test described below, we hoped to assess both the symptoms as well as the key signs of diabetic neuropathy. A 15-item, <span class=\"nowrap\">yes/no</span> questionnaire which included 13 questions relevant to diabetic neuropathy, one to general asthenia, and one to peripheral vascular disease was administered to all patients. We found that a similar number of patients with and without neuropathy answered positively on up to six questions, demonstrating that symptoms do not always indicate underlying neuropathy.</p><p>Similarly, in the Rochester Diabetic Neuropathy Study, assessment of symptoms by either the Neuropathy Symptom Score or the Neuropathy Symptom Profile was poorly reproducible, and significant differences in judging symptom severity occurred even among highly trained neurologists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-diabetic-polyneuropathy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

The earliest signs of diabetic neuropathy probably reflect the gradual loss of integrity of both large myelinated and small myelinated and unmyelinated nerve fibers (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Loss of vibratory sensation and altered proprioception reflect large-fiber loss</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Impairment of pain, light touch, and temperature is secondary to loss of small fibers</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diabetic neuropathy is frequently insidious in onset and can lead to formation of foot ulcers and muscle and joint disease. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incidence of diabetic neuropathy (and other microvascular and macrovascular complications) increases over time. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Natural history'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For the diagnosis of diabetic polyneuropathy, both the San Antonio Consensus and the Mayo Clinic criteria are thorough and appropriate for research purposes. However, they are not practical in routine clinical practice. Simplified criteria have been developed for clinical use (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Criteria for diagnosis'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F65776\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65776 \">figure 1</a>) was designed to diagnose diabetic neuropathy in outpatient clinics. Additional useful screening assessments include the United Kingdom screening test and the tuning fork test. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The Michigan Diabetic Neuropathy Score (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F50683\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50683 \">table 2</a>), which consists of a quantitative neurologic examination and nerve conduction studies, is useful for diagnosing and staging diabetic neuropathy for clinical trials and epidemiologic studies. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Michigan Diabetic Neuropathy Score'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other causes of neuropathy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F76476\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76476 \">table 3</a>) should be considered if there is any aspect of the history or clinical presentation suggesting features atypical of diabetic neuropathy. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diabetic neuropathy should be suspected in any patient with type 1 diabetes of more than five years duration and in all patients with type 2 diabetes. In addition, neuropathy due to prediabetes should be suspected in any patient presenting with &quot;idiopathic&quot; painful neuropathy. Because of the potentially severe complications, including amputation for infected, nonhealing ulcers, early detection of diabetic polyneuropathy is important. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-diabetic-polyneuropathy/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Dyck PJ, Kratz KM, Karnes JL, et al.
