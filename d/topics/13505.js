HF may be caused by disease of the myocardium, pericardium, endocardium, heart valves, vessels, or by metabolic disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-therapy-of-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. HF due to left ventricular dysfunction is categorized according to left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) into HF with reduced ejection fraction (with LVEF &le;40 percent, known as HFrEF; also referred to as systolic HF) and HF with preserved ejection fraction (with LVEF&gt;40 percent; known as HFpEF; also referred to as diastolic HF). </p><p>Pharmacologic therapy of HFrEF will be presented here [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-therapy-of-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. An overview of the management of HFrEF, the management of acute HF, drugs that should be avoided or used with caution in patients with HF, management of HF during pregnancy, the management of refractory HF, and therapy of HFpEF (diastolic HF) are discussed separately.

Additional pharmacologic therapy is directed at management of contributing and associated conditions.

In patients who present with acute HF, long-term therapy is begun following initial stabilization as described separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-acute-decompensated-heart-failure-general-considerations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of acute decompensated heart failure: General considerations&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-acute-decompensated-heart-failure-components-of-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of acute decompensated heart failure: Components of therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The data supporting these summary recommendations are discussed in detail in the appropriate topic reviews on individual pharmacologic agents. Although the use of evidence-based HF therapies has improved due in part to efforts such as the American Heart Association &quot;Get With the Guidelines&quot; program, the underutilization of evidence-based HF therapies continues to contribute to substantial excess mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-therapy-of-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>We recommend the following sequence of pharmacologic therapy for patients with HFrEF (left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] &le;40 percent), with allowance for variations depending upon clinical response and presence of contraindications.</p><p>Initial therapy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loop diuretics are introduced first in patients in volume overload. Diuresis to relieve signs and symptoms of volume overload is pursued while adverse effects are monitored. (See <a href=\"#H17676502\" class=\"local\">'Diuretic'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are typically initiated during or after the optimization of diuretic therapy. These drugs are usually started at low doses and then titrated to goals based upon trial data. (See <a href=\"#H17676617\" class=\"local\">'ACE inhibitor'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are an alternative to ACE inhibitors in patients who cannot tolerate ACE inhibitor for reasons other than renal dysfunction or hyperkalemia. (See <a href=\"#H17676859\" class=\"local\">'Angiotensin II receptor blocker'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We reserve use of the angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sacubitril-and-valsartan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sacubitril-valsartan</a> in place of ACE inhibitor (or single-agent ARB) therapy for patients with no improvement in functional class or worsening symptoms despite optimum combination therapy as discussed below. However, some experts recommend the ARNI sacubitril-valsartan as initial oral therapy (in place of ACE inhibitor or single-agent ARB) in hemodynamically stable patients. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beta blockers are initiated after the patient is stable on ACE inhibitor (or ARB), beginning at low doses with titration to trial doses as tolerated.

An MRA is also recommended for patients who are post-ST elevation myocardial infarction with an LVEF &le;40 percent, are already receiving therapeutic doses of ACE inhibitor, and have either symptomatic HF or diabetes mellitus. MRA therapy is limited to patients with baseline serum potassium &lt;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> and estimated glomerular filtration rate &gt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. (See <a href=\"#H518123616\" class=\"local\">'Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with stable mild to moderate HFrEF (LVEF &le;40 percent), an elevated natriuretic peptide level or hospitalization for HF in the past 12 months, a systolic blood pressure &ge;100 mmHg, estimated glomerular filtration rate &ge;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>, and who have tolerated high doses of ACE inhibitor or ARB therapy (equivalent to at least <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enalapril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">enalapril</a> 10 mg twice daily) for &ge;4 weeks, we suggest use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sacubitril-and-valsartan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sacubitril-valsartan</a>&nbsp;in place of the ACE inhibitor (or single agent ARB) component of therapy. Factors that impact the decision to switch to sacubitril-valsartan in place of ACE inhibitor (or single agent ARB) include patient <span class=\"nowrap\">acceptance/tolerance</span> of drug changes (including need for a 36-hour ACE inhibitor washout period prior to starting sacubitril-valsartan), limited experience with the use of sacubitril-valsartan outside of controlled trials, and cost.

The goal of relieving signs and symptoms of volume overload (such as dyspnea and peripheral edema) should be pursued while adverse effects are monitored. Improvement in symptoms can occur within hours to days. In comparison, the clinical effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a>, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and beta blockers may require weeks or months to become fully apparent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-diuretics-in-patients-with-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of diuretics in patients with heart failure&quot;</a>.) </p><p>The most commonly used loop diuretic for the treatment of HF is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a>, but some patients respond better to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bumetanide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bumetanide</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=torsemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">torsemide</a> because of superior and more predictable absorption. The usual starting dose in outpatients with HF is 20 to 40 mg of furosemide or its equivalent; the maximum suggested total daily dose of furosemide is 400 mg (though some use higher doses). </p><p>Subsequent dosing is determined by the diuretic response. In patients who are volume overloaded, a reasonable goal is weight reduction of 1.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/day</span>. If a patient does not respond, the diuretic dose should initially be increased to find the single effective dose, rather than giving the same dose twice a day. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-diuretics-in-patients-with-heart-failure#H4327964\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of diuretics in patients with heart failure&quot;, section on 'Chronic therapy'</a>.)</p><p>Intravenous diuretics (either as a bolus or a continuous infusion) are more potent than their equivalent oral doses, and may be required for unstable or severe disease. Thiazide diuretics can be added for a synergistic effect. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-diuretics-in-patients-with-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of diuretics in patients with heart failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The fall in intracardiac filling pressure that results from diuretic-induced fluid removal may lower the cardiac output via the Frank-Starling relationship. This effect occurs when the rate of diuresis exceeds the rate of fluid mobilization from tissues, and may occur despite persistent peripheral edema <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ascites. An otherwise unexplained fall in blood pressure or rise in blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine should be viewed as a sign of a potentially important reduction in cardiac output. Further diuresis should be performed at a slower rate and only with careful monitoring for signs and symptoms attributable to hypoperfusion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-diuretics-in-patients-with-heart-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of diuretics in patients with heart failure&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Over the long term, diuretic therapy should be maintained to prevent recurrent edema. In many cases, this adjustment can be facilitated by having the patient record his or her weight each day and allowing him or her to make changes in dose if the weight increases or decreases beyond a specified range.</p><p>Although data on diuretic efficacy are limited, a meta-analysis of a few small trials found that diuretics were associated with reduction in mortality as well as reduced admission for worsening HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-therapy-of-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, diuretic therapy requires careful monitoring given observational data showing an association between non-potassium-sparing diuretics and arrhythmic death. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-diuretics-in-patients-with-heart-failure#H31397796\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of diuretics in patients with heart failure&quot;, section on 'Efficacy and safety'</a>.)</p><p>Appropriate diuretic usage can also affect the success of other drugs given for the treatment of HF. Inappropriately low doses will result in fluid retention, which can diminish the response to ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and increase the risk of decompensation with the use of beta blockers. Conversely, excessive diuresis will lead to volume contraction, which can increase the risk of hypotension and renal insufficiency with ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and beta blockers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17676617\"><span class=\"h2\">ACE inhibitor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with asymptomatic or symptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction should be treated with an ACE inhibitor. </p><p>Beginning therapy with low doses (eg, 6.25 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=captopril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">captopril</a> three times daily, 2.5 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enalapril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">enalapril</a> twice daily, or 5 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lisinopril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lisinopril</a> once daily) will reduce the likelihood of hypotension and azotemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-therapy-of-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. If initial therapy is tolerated, the dose is then gradually increased at one- to two-week intervals to, if tolerated, a target dose of 50 mg three times daily of captopril, 20 mg twice daily of enalapril, or up to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> of lisinopril or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinapril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quinapril</a>. These relatively high doses are recommended because they were used in the successful trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-therapy-of-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Although there is uncertainty if these doses are much more beneficial than lower doses, maximum dose therapy, if tolerated, is still recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-therapy-of-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/1,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7,8</a>]. If the target doses cannot be administered or are poorly tolerated, the tolerated lower doses should be used.

While therapy may be initiated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=captopril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">captopril</a> in patients in whom there is concern about blood pressure reduction, we prefer once-per-day agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lisinopril-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lisinopril</a> for convenience in long-term therapy in these patients, who typically receive multiple medications. Blood should be obtained in all patients one to two weeks after starting or changing a dose and periodically thereafter to assess the plasma potassium concentration and renal function. </p><p>ACE inhibitors improve survival in patients with left ventricular systolic dysfunction (left ventricular EF [LVEF] &le;40 percent), ranging from asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-therapy-of-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>] to moderate or severe HFrEF (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F75136%7ECARD%2F70015%7ECARD%2F62325\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75136 graphicRef70015 graphicRef62325 \">figure 1A-C</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacologic-therapy-of-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>].

Not uncommonly, a dose that is not well tolerated during initial up-titration will be tolerated at a later time or with a slower rate of up-titration.
