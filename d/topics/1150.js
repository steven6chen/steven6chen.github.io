The most commonly involved organs are the brain (seizures, increased intracranial pressure), eyes (papilledema, retinal hemorrhages, exudates), heart (heart failure), and kidneys (renal insufficiency).</p><p>The absolute degree of BP elevation is less important than whether end organ symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> damage is present and is associated with an acute change in mean arterial pressure. For example, a child with chronic hypertension may have very high BP measurements with no symptoms. Another child with an acute rise in BP may manifest a hypertensive emergency despite a BP that is only moderately elevated. Careful intervention to lower blood pressure should begin emergently upon recognition of a hypertensive emergency, and should be accomplished with intravenous antihypertensive agents (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F80380\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80380 \">table 5</a>).

However, in the setting of a chronic condition (eg, chronic kidney disease), where blood pressure has increased gradually over time, lowering of the blood pressure should occur less quickly (eg, hours to days) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F65359\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef65359 \">algorithm 1</a>).

Once the BP exceeds the autoregulatory zone, excess pressure is applied to the distal vasculature resulting in increased vessel permeability, endothelial damage, and arteriolar fibrinoid necrosis. These effects combine to cause tissue edema, vasoconstriction, and tissue ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-hypertensive-emergencies-and-urgencies-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary or secondary renin release &ndash; Renin release from the juxtaglomerular apparatus of the kidney leads to increased levels of angiotensin I that is subsequently converted into angiotensin II in the lungs. Angiotensin II promotes vasoconstriction, NADPH oxidase activity, and expression of proinflammatory cytokines. Increased NADPH oxidase activity produces reactive oxygen species. Release of proinflammatory cytokines causes local inflammation, proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells, and endothelial damage. The end result is progressive cytotoxic effects and tissue ischemia occurring in a self-perpetuating cycle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-hypertensive-emergencies-and-urgencies-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Oxidative stress &ndash; Oxidative stress reduces nitric oxide levels, thereby inhibiting vasodilation. Reactive oxygen species (eg, chemical agents with oxygen free radicals) may also directly damage blood vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-hypertensive-emergencies-and-urgencies-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endothelial dysfunction &ndash; BP elevation, renin release, and oxidative stress together cause endothelial dysfunction. The hallmarks of endothelial dysfunction are vasoconstriction, perivascular inflammation and activation of the coagulation cascade. These events result in vascular obstruction, target organ damage, and severe elevation in BP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-hypertensive-emergencies-and-urgencies-in-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The history and physical examination should first focus on signs of acute organ symptom <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> damage and then seek to identify the underlying etiology once treatment has been initiated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F82046\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82046 \">table 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-hypertensive-emergencies-and-urgencies-in-children/abstract/6,13-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,13-17</a>].
