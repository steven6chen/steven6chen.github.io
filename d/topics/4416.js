The 2017 Concussion in Sport Group consensus statement provides additional components used in clinically defining concussion as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Concussion may be caused by a direct blow to the head, face, neck, or elsewhere on the body with an 'impulsive' force transmitted to the head.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Concussion typically results in the rapid onset of short-lived impairment of neurologic function that resolves spontaneously. However, in some cases, signs and symptoms may evolve over a number of minutes to hours. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Concussion may result in neuropathological changes, but the acute clinical signs and symptoms largely reflect a functional disturbance rather than a structural injury and, as such, no abnormality is seen on standard structural neuroimaging studies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Concussion results in a range of clinical signs and symptoms that may or may not involve loss of consciousness. Resolution of the clinical and cognitive features typically follows a sequential course. However, in some cases, symptoms may be prolonged.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The clinical signs and symptoms cannot be explained by drug, alcohol, or medication use, other injuries (such as cervical injuries, peripheral vestibular dysfunction, etc) or other comorbidities (eg, psychological factors or coexisting medical conditions.&quot; </p><p/><p>In the past, severity of concussion was graded either numerically (grade 1, 2 or 3), or as mild, moderate, or severe, primarily based upon the presence and duration of loss of consciousness. However, the Concussion in Sport Group consensus statement and the American Academy of Neurology Revised Position Statement on Concussion in Sport no longer use this grading scale because evidence indicates that a brief loss of consciousness in association with concussion does <strong>not</strong> predict clinical course or long-term cognitive impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Similarly, the absence of loss of consciousness in a young athlete who has sustained a concussion should <strong>not</strong> be used to justify more rapid return to play.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26279311\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Animal and human studies demonstrate that concussion results from a rapid rotational acceleration of the brain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. While most often this rotational acceleration is triggered by a blow to the head, direct impact to the head is not required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,4,5</a>]. When a concussion is caused by a blow to the head, the location of impact does not appear to correlate with concussion outcomes. As an example, in a national surveillance study of 1975 concussions sustained by high school American football players and reported by athletic trainers, the number of symptoms and duration of concussion was not significantly different regardless of the site of head impact [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, top of the head impact was significantly more likely to cause loss of consciousness than front of the head or side of the head impact (8 versus 3.5 percent).</p><p>Rotational acceleration of the brain is hypothesized to cause a shear strain of the underlying neural elements with the following associated and sequential effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Neuronal depolarization</strong> &ndash; Opening of sodium-potassium channels within the axonal membrane of affected neurons leads to a massive influx of sodium and efflux of potassium. Calcium-dependent release of excitatory amino acids, particularly glutamate, further stimulates potassium efflux. This process results in the effective depolarization of affected neurons, leading to depolarization of downstream neurons, a phenomenon similar to spreading depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Local lactic acid accumulation</strong> &ndash; As ionic homeostasis is disrupted, affected neurons are suppressed and cannot fire normal, purposeful action potentials until ionic homeostasis is restored [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/7-9,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9,12</a>]. Sodium-potassium pumps work to restore homeostasis, a process that requires <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adenosine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">adenosine</a> triphosphate (ATP). Given the massive degree of the induced ion fluxes, a large amount of ATP is required to operate the sodium-potassium pump. This increased demand for ATP, which is derived ultimately from glucose, results in an increase in glycolysis, leading to local lactic acid accumulation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Decreased cerebral blood flow with mismatch of cerebral glucose supply and demand</strong> &ndash; Concomitantly, there is a decrease in cerebral blood flow for a period of days to weeks after concussion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/10,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,13</a>]. Since glucose is delivered to the brain via the blood stream, the increased demand for glucose and its end product, ATP, go unmet. This supply-demand mismatch is thought to result in the cognitive dysfunction and symptoms of concussion.</p><p/><p>Most elements of this hypothesis are derived from an animal model of brain injury known as fluid percussion, in which a craniotomy is performed, a syringe is attached to the skull so that the fluid in the syringe is continuous with the cerebrospinal fluid, and an impact to the plunger of the syringe generates a pressure wave through the brain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-10</a>]. It is unclear whether the effects caused by fluid percussion can be generalized to those caused by the rapid, rotational acceleration of the brain experienced by athletes suffering sport-related concussions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p>Although shear stress is the leading hypothesis for the pathophysiology of concussion, it is not the only one. A detailed discussion of the proposed pathophysiology of concussion, including the evidence base for competing theories, is provided in the references [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26279317\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among surveyed United States middle school and high school children, the self-reported lifetime prevalence of concussion is approximately 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report that as many as 3.8 million sport-related traumatic brain injuries occur annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]; the vast majority of traumatic brain injuries that occur in sports are concussions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Furthermore, a significant proportion of sport-related injuries sustained by athletes of all ages are concussions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-27</a>]. For example, in a prospective observational study that captured American football injuries from approximately 4000 athlete-seasons for youth, 12,000 athlete-seasons for high school players, and 4300 athlete-seasons for college players, concussions accounted for 4 to 10 percent of all injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>The incidence of concussion is highest among boys playing collision sports, such as rugby, American football, ice hockey, and lacrosse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/20,24,26,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,24,26,28</a>]. Among girls, those who participate in soccer, lacrosse, and field hockey have the highest incidences of concussion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/24,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,26</a>]. Concussion also frequently accompanies motor vehicle collisions and injuries sustained during other recreational activities (eg, bicycle riding, skate-boarding, ice skating, or skiing) in children and adolescents. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minor-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children-evaluation#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Minor head trauma in infants and children: Evaluation&quot;, section on 'Mechanism'</a>.)</p><p>Since 2000, there has been a dramatic increase in the diagnosis of concussion among pediatric and adolescent athletes in the outpatient and emergency department settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/29-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-32</a>]. Estimates suggest that sports and recreational activities account for 25 to 50 percent of concussions that report to the emergency department [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/29,33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,33,34</a>]. Similar increases in the number of concussion diagnoses made by athletic trainers have also been observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/6,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,35</a>], a fact which is significant since many sport-related concussions are managed by athletic trainers as opposed to physicians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Observational studies suggest that the incidence of sport-related concussion is higher for high school and college female athletes than male athletes when sports governed by similar rules for both sexes are compared [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/26,36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,36-38</a>]. While, in some studies, girls' soccer shows a higher incidence of sport-related concussion than boys' soccer, the same cannot be consistently said of basketball [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/24,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,26</a>].</p><p>Primary care providers are frequently called upon to care for athletes suffering from sport-related concussions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/24,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,39</a>]. As an example, in one observational study of 1056 high school students with sport-related concussions, approximately 60 percent of patients were managed by a primary care physician while about 10 percent were managed by a specialist (eg, sports medicine physician, neurosurgeon, or neurologist) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

However, the authors of this topic routinely perform baseline testing prior to participation in contact and collision sports or athletes otherwise at high risk, including those with prior sport-related concussions, because the ability to diagnose and manage a concussion during subacute or office assessment is likely enhanced if a properly performed baseline test is available for comparison.

Having baseline scores in these patients helps to distinguish a concussion from high baseline symptom burden and, in patients who have sustained a concussion, inform management decisions. As an example, in a large observational study of almost 32,000 high school athletes with no concussion in the past six months and who underwent baseline computerized baseline testing, 21 to 47 percent of boys with a prior history of psychiatric illness or migraines and 33 to 72 percent of girls with a prior history of substance abuse, psychiatric illness, or attention deficit disorder with hyperactivity had symptom scores that would meet international criteria for prolonged concussion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. For patients with these conditions, neurocognitive testing before sports participation provides more information that may help clarify the etiology of symptoms in these patients if a concussion is sustained and assist with proper management.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Thus, many but not all sports medicine specialists support baseline neuropsychological testing for young athletes participating in contact sports (eg, basketball, soccer) or collision sports (eg, American football, rugby, lacrosse, or hockey). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although validity of these tests have been established, many factors affect test outcomes, including the mood and motivation of the athlete, the testing environment, method of administration, and expertise of the person evaluating the results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/55,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,64</a>].

Many sports medicine specialists do not consider baseline neuropsychological testing necessary.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">It is essential that the individual performing the preparticipation evaluation is properly trained. Also, the assessments administered at baseline should be the ones that will be used during concussion evaluation, both sideline and subsequent office assessment. Sideline assessments should be documented and stored securely but with the ability for comparison in an injured athlete.</p><p/><p>In addition, the environment in which baseline assessments are performed should be as similar as possible to that in which the post-injury assessments are likely to be performed. Thus, baseline sideline assessments of concussion are often performed on the field or at rink side during a practice session in an attempt to simulate the environment, the degree of physical fatigue, and other factors often experienced during game time.</p><p>Regardless of the type of baseline testing, an honest effort by athletes is a prerequisite. There are concerns that athletes who are motivated to remain in the game could intentionally do poorly on baseline testing in an effort to evade clinical detection of subsequent concussion. Obviously this would put the athlete at risk and undermines the effective clinical relationship of the medical team. Efforts have been made to build internal quality control measures that make this type of &quot;sandbagging&quot; difficult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. However, if clinicians administering the tests are not properly trained, sandbagging may go undetected.</p><p>According to the National Athletic Trainers' Association, sport teams should also have a written concussion protocol that details how the medical team will respond to a concussion as part of the Emergency Action Plan. The plan should specify the steps involved in the acute response to a suspected concussion, the sideline and in-office evaluations used, the medical personnel responsible for decision making, and the team discharge instructions given to injured athletes and their families or roommates when they leave the event.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26279359\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The signs and symptoms of concussion are nonspecific and the presentation is varied (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F91005\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91005 \">table 1</a>). Thus, care must be taken to ensure an accurate diagnosis.

In patients with a witnessed head trauma, serious intracranial injury is the primary concern. In instances where a definite trauma is not witnessed, patients with acute illness, other than concussion, may be misdiagnosed as having a concussion simply because they participate in contact or collision sports or other activities that place them at risk for concussion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6005092\"><span class=\"h3\">Intracranial injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical findings of serious intracranial injury (eg, subdural or epidural hematoma) and concussion overlap. Pediatric patients with prolonged loss of consciousness, seizures, persistent altered mental status, an abnormal neurologic examination, worsening headache, or repeated vomiting are at an increased risk for intracranial injury and usually warrant emergent neuroimaging. (See <a href=\"#H19941684\" class=\"local\">'Acute or emergency department assessment'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6005098\"><span class=\"h3\">Heat illness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Similar to pediatric patients with concussion, children and adolescents with heat illness may have headache, vomiting, confusion, and, in patients with heat stroke, abnormal mental status (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F65625\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65625 \">table 7</a>). Elevated temperature and signs of dehydration are typically seen in athletes with heat illness which distinguishes it from concussion.

As blood glucose continues to fall, they may develop agitation, confusion, and altered mental status which may mimic a concussion. Insulin dependent diabetic patients are at greatest risk during athletic competition or other exertion. Any patient with persistent or worsening altered mental status warrants measurement of a rapid blood glucose. Clinical findings and initial emergent management of hypoglycemia is provided in the rapid overview (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F83485\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83485 \">table 8</a>).

Furthermore, a crossover study of 24 adult patients that compared euvolemic and dehydrated patients did find that dehydration was associated with visual memory deficits, although performance on the Standardized Assessment of Concussion and the Balance Error Scoring System was not significantly different [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].

In many instances, the patient has a sudden loss of consciousness followed by rapid recovery. Children and adolescents with this history warrant careful history, cardiac examination, and an electrocardiogram. Syncope associated with dehydration <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> change in posture suggests vasovagal or orthostatic syncope. Constitutional findings often seen in patients with concussion, such as confusion, memory deficits, nausea, and headache are relatively uncommon in patients with syncope.

Thus, a history of witnessed rotational head trauma with signs and symptoms of concussion soon after the injury are essential to distinguish psychological symptoms arising from concussion from primary disease. In addition, history of a prior psychiatric disorder, recreational drug use, and accurate baseline testing of psychological symptoms are an important means of determining if behavioral symptoms are new or changed from baseline. (See <a href=\"#H786132\" class=\"local\">'Preparticipation assessments'</a> above.)</p><p>The clinician should also monitor previously healthy patients with prolonged symptoms of concussion for signs of psychiatric illness. Concussion can cause significant stress to student athletes, particularly in those cases where recovery is slow. Those who were previously performing at high levels in the classroom and athletic field can be dismayed by the loss of identity while they are asked to institute cognitive and physical rest. Students can also feel distressed by the realization that school work is more difficult to complete and grades are more difficult to maintain during recovery. In addition, students often feel pressure to keep up on their class work during a busy academic year. The buildup of assignments missed during recovery can be daunting.</p><p>Athletes that suffer prolonged recoveries after a concussion also go from consistent exercise to prolonged periods of inactivity. This change in activity alone can result in sleep disruption, irritability, change in appetite, change in body weight, and depressed mood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/concussion-in-children-and-adolescents-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis/abstract/78-80\" class=\"abstract_t\">78-80</a>].</p><p>In addition to history and change from known baseline, psychiatric testing or referral is appropriate when psychological symptoms are impeding recovery or when a specific psychiatric disorder is suspected.
