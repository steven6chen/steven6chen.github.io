Some particular concerns among patients with rheumatic diseases include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many rheumatic diseases are associated with increased risks of coronary artery disease, arrhythmias, heart failure, or cardiac death.

An exercise or pharmacologic stress test may be necessary in some circumstances to adequately assess the risk of perioperative myocardial infarction.

Management of such patients depends upon their specific drug regimen and whether or not they have APS. The treatment of APS and the management of patients receiving anticoagulants in the perioperative setting are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-venous-thromboembolic-disease-in-surgical-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of venous thromboembolic disease in surgical patients&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome#H2178609095\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of antiphospholipid syndrome&quot;, section on 'Primary thrombosis prevention'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-antiphospholipid-syndrome#H2435785241\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of antiphospholipid syndrome&quot;, section on 'Secondary thrombosis prevention'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perioperative-management-of-patients-receiving-anticoagulants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perioperative management of patients receiving anticoagulants&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Medication management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal strategy for managing immunosuppressive therapies during the perioperative period is unknown due to the lack of evidence. We discuss our approach to management of the major categories of medications used for the treatment of various rheumatic diseases in the perioperative setting below; it is largely based on low-quality evidence and expert opinion. A rheumatologist should be involved in the medication management around the time of surgery.</p><p>Our approach is generally consistent with guidelines proposed by the American College of Rheumatology and the American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons for the perioperative management of various immunosuppressive medications in patients undergoing total hip and knee arthroplasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-evaluation-and-perioperative-management-of-patients-with-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6802267\"><span class=\"h3\">Glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The major concerns with regard to glucocorticoid use in the setting of surgery are: (1) the risk of surgical site infections and (2) the risk of hemodynamic instability (secondary to glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency). Ideally, the lowest possible dose of glucocorticoids should be used in the perioperative setting in order to minimize these risks. If patients require greater than 10 mg <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (or equivalent) daily, it would imply that the disease activity is not adequately controlled and that elective surgery should be postponed. Therefore, we suggest that the dose of prednisone is less than or equal to 10 mg per day before surgery is planned. Patients should continue their outpatient glucocorticoid dose perioperatively, which may require parenteral administration (of the equivalent dose) if a patient is taking nothing by mouth.</p><p>Limited data suggest that the risk of infection associated with glucocorticoids is lower when the daily dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> does not exceed 15 mg. A population-based study including 381 knee or hip arthroplasties performed in 259 patients with RA found that steroid doses over 15 mg per day were associated with a 20-fold increase in the risk of post-arthroplasty infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-evaluation-and-perioperative-management-of-patients-with-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Being overweight and having coronary artery disease were also risk factors for infection.</p><p>There is controversy regarding the role of supraphysiologic (or &quot;stress dose&quot;) glucocorticoids in the perioperative setting. There are limited data regarding the optimal approach to managing patients at risk for glucocorticoid-induced adrenal insufficiency, and practices vary among clinicians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-evaluation-and-perioperative-management-of-patients-with-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/1,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7,8</a>]. Much of the data come from surgical trials that are not specific to patients with rheumatic diseases. Our approach to glucocorticoid use in the perioperative setting is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-management-of-the-surgical-patient-taking-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The management of the surgical patient taking glucocorticoids&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Prolonged use of glucocorticoids may cause other complications related to surgery, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impaired wound healing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased friability of skin and superficial blood vessels</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hematoma or skin ulceration due to mild pressure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased susceptibility of the skin to tears from adhesive tape</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased risk of fracture, infections, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, or ulcer</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To avoid the antiplatelet effect of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> during surgery, these drugs should be stopped prior to surgery. A detailed discussion related to the timing and duration of discontinuation of NSAIDs in the perioperative period can be found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perioperative-medication-management#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perioperative medication management&quot;, section on 'Aspirin'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perioperative-medication-management#H28\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Perioperative medication management&quot;, section on 'Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs'</a>.)</p><p>The cardiovascular risks associated with the use of nonselective and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 selective NSAIDs are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonselective-nsaids-adverse-cardiovascular-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonselective NSAIDs: Adverse cardiovascular effects&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cox-2-selective-inhibitors-adverse-cardiovascular-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;COX-2 selective inhibitors: Adverse cardiovascular effects&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Nonbiologic DMARDs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although a reasonable concern exists about the potential of nonbiologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) to increase the risk of infection by affecting the immune response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-evaluation-and-perioperative-management-of-patients-with-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>], stopping DMARDs prior to surgery may result in a flare-up of disease activity, which may adversely affect rehabilitation. In patients taking nonbiologic DMARDs for the treatment of rheumatic diseases, we continue the current dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (MTX), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leflunomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leflunomide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a>, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulfasalazine</a> throughout the perioperative period. In clinical practice, the nonbiologic DMARD dose is often missed for one day and up to three days while the patient is hospitalized.</p><p>Several studies of RA patients undergoing elective orthopedic surgery have found that continued use of MTX through the perioperative period is safe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-evaluation-and-perioperative-management-of-patients-with-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. As an example, a systematic review including four studies with RA patients undergoing elective orthopedic surgery evaluated the effects of continuing MTX versus stopping MTX in the perioperative period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-evaluation-and-perioperative-management-of-patients-with-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Continued MTX therapy was safe perioperatively and was associated with a reduced risk of flares. There was no evidence to suggest that stopping MTX preoperatively reduced the incidence of infection or improved wound healing. However, in all of the studies, the mean dose of MTX was less than 15 mg per week. Limited data on the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leflunomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leflunomide</a> during the perioperative period are conflicting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-evaluation-and-perioperative-management-of-patients-with-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. In one study, there were significantly more wound complications in patients taking leflunomide at the time of elective orthopedic surgery compared with patients on MTX [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-evaluation-and-perioperative-management-of-patients-with-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, another small study compared patients who continued leflunomide for four weeks prior to arthroplasty versus those who withheld leflunomide and found no difference between the groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-evaluation-and-perioperative-management-of-patients-with-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. There are also limited data suggesting it is safe to continue <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulfasalazine</a> in the perioperative period. In a retrospective study of 367 orthopedic surgeries among 204 RA patients, two-thirds of whom were receiving nonbiologic DMARDs including hydroxychloroquine and sulfasalazine, there was no increased infection associated with nonbiologic DMARD use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-evaluation-and-perioperative-management-of-patients-with-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Biologic DMARDs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients taking biologic DMARDs for rheumatic diseases, we withhold the biologic medication and plan the elective surgery at the end of the dosing cycle for that specific medication. As an example, patients taking weekly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etanercept-including-biosimilars-of-etanercept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etanercept</a> should aim to schedule the surgery in the second week after the first withheld dose. Patients taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adalimumab-including-biosimilars-of-adalimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adalimumab</a> in two-week intervals should plan the surgery in the third week after the first withheld dose. In a similar manner, patients on monthly intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abatacept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abatacept</a> should schedule the surgery in the fifth week after the first withheld dose. Patients taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> should wait until month 7 after the last dose to schedule the surgery, presumably when B cells have returned to the circulation. However, we do not delay nonelective procedures in patients who have been more recently treated. Additional information regarding the use of these agents for the treatment of rheumatic diseases can be found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-biologic-agents-and-kinase-inhibitors-in-the-rheumatic-diseases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of biologic agents and kinase inhibitors in the rheumatic diseases&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There is relatively little evidence available regarding the optimal timing for use of biologic DMARDs in the perioperative period, and our approach is largely based on indirect evidence suggesting an increased risk of infection associated with their use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-evaluation-and-perioperative-management-of-patients-with-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-biologic-agents-and-kinase-inhibitors-in-the-rheumatic-diseases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of biologic agents and kinase inhibitors in the rheumatic diseases&quot;</a>). Many [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-evaluation-and-perioperative-management-of-patients-with-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/20-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-24</a>], but not all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-evaluation-and-perioperative-management-of-patients-with-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>], retrospective studies suggest that use of tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors does not increase the risk of postoperative infections or impair wound healing. A retrospective review evaluated the association between the timing of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a> infusion and rates of serious infection after elective hip or knee arthroplasties in 4288 patients with autoimmune diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-evaluation-and-perioperative-management-of-patients-with-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Administering infliximab within four weeks before surgery was not associated with a higher postoperative infection risk within 30 days or a prosthetic joint infection within one year when compared with patients whose infliximab was withheld for 8 to 12 weeks prior to surgery. However, glucocorticoid use, especially doses greater than 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> was associated with an increased risk of postoperative infection.</p><p>The infectious risks of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abatacept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abatacept</a> are similar to those of TNF inhibitors and other biologic agents, but there are no trials that have examined its safety perioperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-evaluation-and-perioperative-management-of-patients-with-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/17,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,27</a>]. A case series described eight uncomplicated surgeries in seven RA patients on abatacept [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-evaluation-and-perioperative-management-of-patients-with-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Similarly, there is no direct evidence regarding the safety of the interleukin (IL)-1 receptor inhibitor anakinra in the perioperative period. Conclusions regarding perioperative safety are largely based on trials in nonoperative patients showing that the infection rate was similar to that in patients receiving placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-evaluation-and-perioperative-management-of-patients-with-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

There is no evidence regarding the optimal time to restart biologic DMARDs in the perioperative setting, and this approach is based on standard precautions used for biologic agents that warn against use in patients with active infection, such as an open wound.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1891606057\"><span class=\"h3\">Antirheumatic kinase inhibitor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tofacitinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tofacitinib</a>, we withhold tofacitinib for at least one week prior to surgery. Tofacitinib is an orally administered Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor that is used in the management of patients with moderately to severely active RA. Our approach is based on indirect evidence for systemic reviews and meta-analyses of tofacitinib in nonsurgical patients showing there is an increased risk of infection with tofacitinib compared with placebo. Although the half-life is thought to be short for tofacitinib, there is uncertainty regarding the duration of immunosuppression after the drug is held [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-evaluation-and-perioperative-management-of-patients-with-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/4,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,30</a>]. Information regarding the efficacy and safety of tofacitinib is presented separately.

Medications other than steroids typically used for SLE patients include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a>, MTX, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>. Given the clinical spectrum of SLE disease severity and organ involvement, the decision to withhold medications prior to surgery should be made on an individual basis. Thus, for patients with severe SLE and multiorgan involvement in which discontinuation of the medication may result in a disease flare, it is reasonable to continue the medications through the surgical period. This is based on indirect evidence from organ transplant patients that supports continuing anti-rejection therapy during the time of surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preoperative-evaluation-and-perioperative-management-of-patients-with-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. However, if a patient has mild SLE, withholding medications seven days prior to surgery is also reasonable.
