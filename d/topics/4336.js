The characteristic immunologic defect is the inability of B cells to differentiate into plasma cells capable of secreting all immunoglobulin types. While CVID is often regarded as a disease of adults, it does affect children, and diagnosis in young children can be challenging.</p><p>Clinical features of CVID and issues in the diagnosis and management of this disorder that are specific to pediatric patients (less than 18 years of age) will be reviewed here. Additional reviews of CVID, which emphasize adult manifestations and management, are found separately.

In one large series of primary immunodeficiency in children diagnosed over a 10-year period, CVID made up 12 of 189 total cases (9 percent) and 20 percent of the 87 cases of antibody deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-variable-immunodeficiency-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Most patients with CVID present after puberty, and the disorder is usually diagnosed in the second or third decade of life. However, about 25 percent of all CVID patients present in childhood or adolescence, and there is an earlier peak of diagnosis at approximately eight years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-variable-immunodeficiency-in-children/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. A diagnosis of CVID before six years of age is particularly problematic because of immunologic immaturity and the persistence of transient hypogammaglobulinemia of infancy in some children.</p><p>Additional information about the epidemiology of CVID is found separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-and-diagnosis-of-common-variable-immunodeficiency-in-adults#H1191865\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, epidemiology, and diagnosis of common variable immunodeficiency in adults&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10572368\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many children with CVID are small and appear chronically ill. They often have chronic cough. They may show signs of chronic upper or lower respiratory infections including otitis, purulent nasal discharge, or visible postnasal drainage. Tonsils and lymphoid tissue are usually present and sometimes enlarged. Pulmonary findings of rales, wheezing, and digital clubbing may be present. Hepatosplenomegaly suggests gastrointestinal or autoimmune problems. Signs of arthritis, vasculitis, or vitiligo may be present. Skin infections or eczema may be noted.</p><p>The types of disorders that develop in patients with CVID are similar in adults and children, although there are some differences in the prevalence of certain manifestations of the disease. Two pediatric series demonstrate the various presenting disorders:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one series of 12 children with CVID, the most common presenting infections were rhinosinusitis (75 percent), otitis media (67 percent), and pneumonia (58 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-variable-immunodeficiency-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Bronchiectasis was seen in three children. One patient presented with chronic diarrhea due to Giardia infection. Autoimmune disorders including immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and neutropenia were noted. Asthma was seen in 10 patients but was not typically a presenting disorder. Two patients presented with failure-to-thrive (FTT). Other disorders included growth hormone deficiency, hypothyroidism, end-stage renal disease, and sarcoma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A second series of 32 children noted similar presenting disorders: chronic respiratory tract infections (88 percent), rhinosinusitis (78 percent), otitis media (78 percent), and intestinal tract infections (34 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-variable-immunodeficiency-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Meningitis, sepsis, and pyelonephritis were also observed. A significant number of children (31 percent) experienced an autoimmune disease. Bronchiectasis was noted in 34 percent, and lymphoid malignancy was noted in 13 percent. Vaccine-related poliomyelitis occurred in two patients. Several children had growth and developmental delay.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2154824\"><span class=\"h2\">Recurrent infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pediatric patients with CVID often experience recurrent pyogenic infections of the upper and lower respiratory tracts and chronic gastrointestinal infections, with the same spectrum of organisms seen in adult patients. (See <a href=\"#H10572409\" class=\"local\">'Gastrointestinal problems'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-and-diagnosis-of-common-variable-immunodeficiency-in-adults#H9597804\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, epidemiology, and diagnosis of common variable immunodeficiency in adults&quot;, section on 'Gastrointestinal disease'</a>.)</p><p>There are rare reports of chronic enteroviral infections causing neurodegenerative diseases or encephalitis. One case series described 32 children, in which two cases of poliovirus-related vaccine paresis were reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-variable-immunodeficiency-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10572385\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulmonary manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Up to 73 percent of CVID patients (all ages) develop chronic structural pulmonary complications, including bronchiectasis and bronchial wall thickening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-variable-immunodeficiency-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In a study of 54 children with either CVID or similar disorders, structural lung disease was found in more than 85 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-variable-immunodeficiency-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Most children had mild bronchiectasis scores, although 5 percent were scored moderate-to-severe. Twenty-five percent of CVID children had multiple lung nodules, which tended to resolve after treatment with systemic glucocorticoids. The etiology of these nodules is not fully understood, and they may result from either direct damage induced by infectious organisms or from an altered compensatory immune response leading to granulomatous changes.</p><p>High-resolution computed tomography has been found to be the most sensitive method for identification of these structural abnormalities. It is an important diagnostic tool for pulmonary complications because it can detect abnormalities that are missed by chest radiographs or pulmonary function testing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-and-diagnosis-of-common-variable-immunodeficiency-in-adults#H1193479\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, epidemiology, and diagnosis of common variable immunodeficiency in adults&quot;, section on 'Pulmonary disease'</a>.)</p><p>Obstructive flow-volume curves have been found in 50 to 94 percent of patients (all ages) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-variable-immunodeficiency-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Children with CVID frequently have pulmonary airway obstructive disease indistinguishable from asthma. In the series of 12 children described previously, 83 percent had asthma, although none had life-threatening symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-variable-immunodeficiency-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The prevalence of obstructive lung disease in children with CVID appears to be higher than what is reported in adults. This may be in part due to recurrent viral illnesses associated with childhood.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10572393\"><span class=\"h2\">Allergic diseases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the two pediatric series mentioned above, 38 percent of patients in one of the cohorts had some evidence of an allergic disease, including asthma, food allergy, eczema, urticaria, and rhinitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-variable-immunodeficiency-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], and 83 percent had asthma in the other [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-variable-immunodeficiency-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In a series of 45 patients, 5 had atopic dermatitis and 6 had eosinophilic esophagitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-variable-immunodeficiency-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. It is sometimes argued that immunoglobulin E (IgE) sensitization, which is a type of specific antibody response, is uncommon in patients with CVID. Indeed, some patients with allergic symptoms have undetectable serum IgE. However, given the frequency of these diseases in the available pediatric series, we believe that allergic symptoms in children should be thoroughly evaluated with skin testing or assays for allergen-specific IgE.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10572401\"><span class=\"h2\">Failure-to-thrive</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Failure-to-thrive (FTT) is an important manifestation of immunodeficiency in children and is usually attributed to repetitive illnesses. However, primary growth hormone deficiency and hypothyroidism have also been reported in hypogammaglobulinemic children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-variable-immunodeficiency-in-children/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=failure-to-thrive-undernutrition-in-children-younger-than-two-years-etiology-and-evaluation#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Failure to thrive (undernutrition) in children younger than two years: Etiology and evaluation&quot;, section on 'Etiology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=poor-weight-gain-in-children-older-than-two-years-of-age#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Poor weight gain in children older than two years of age&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic approach'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10572409\"><span class=\"h2\">Gastrointestinal problems</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diarrhea, malabsorption, and weight loss are common problems in both children and adults with CVID [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-variable-immunodeficiency-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Gastrointestinal infections include <em>Helicobacter pylori</em> and <em>Giardia lamblia</em>. Other intestinal pathogens such as <em>Salmonella</em>, <em>Shigella</em>, and <em>Campylobacter</em> are also reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-variable-immunodeficiency-in-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Crohn disease and ulcerative colitis are reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-variable-immunodeficiency-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], although similar findings can be a manifestation of granulomatous disease associated with immune dysregulation. Nodular intestinal hyperplasia occurs relatively frequently in adolescents with CVID (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F80570\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80570 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-variable-immunodeficiency-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Manifestations are similar in adults and children.

Autoimmune cytopenias are a more common presenting disorder in children than adults and may be the initial manifestation of the disease. Autoimmune neutropenia, ITP, hemolytic anemia, or combinations of these disorders are possible. Insulin-dependent diabetes, psoriasis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and juvenile idiopathic arthritis are also associated with CVID, although these are less common. Children with these diseases may be cared for in hematology, rheumatology, or endocrine clinics for a period of time before the underlying diagnosis is appreciated.

Fas expression on peripheral blood T and B cells and Fas-mediated elimination of activated T cells were found to be elevated in seven children with Evans syndrome, compared with control children with acute ITP or other nonimmune disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-variable-immunodeficiency-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Among the seven with Evans syndrome, five eventually developed CVID. In another series of Evans syndrome patients, 3 of 35 pediatric patients were found to have CVID, and these authors suggested that immunodeficiency screening in this population may be recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-variable-immunodeficiency-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-and-diagnosis-of-common-variable-immunodeficiency-in-adults#H1193528\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, epidemiology, and diagnosis of common variable immunodeficiency in adults&quot;, section on 'Malignancies'</a>.)</p><p>Data specific to children are limited, although early development of malignancy is considered uncommon in children with CVID. However, in the previous noted series of 32 children, 4 developed a malignancy during the follow-up period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-variable-immunodeficiency-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Two of these children had Hodgkin disease, one had non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and one patient had Burkitt lymphoma. In another series of pediatric CVID patients, 4 of 27 developed malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-variable-immunodeficiency-in-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In this series, 3 of 27 developed non-Hodgkin lymphoma (2 patients diagnosed with mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue lymphoma, and 1 malignancy was Epstein-Barr virus-associated) and one patient developed astrocytoma. In the authors' series, one patient had undifferentiated sarcoma prior to the identification of CVID, suggesting that malignancy may also occur as a primary event prior to identification of immunodeficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-variable-immunodeficiency-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In a series of 45 children, 1 had melanoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-variable-immunodeficiency-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Despite the small numbers of patients, these studies suggest that pediatric CVID patients may have increased risk of lymphoma and other malignancies, similar to adult patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10572433\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of CVID is not always possible to make with certainty in young children. However, it is important to follow the patient regularly and make the diagnosis as expediently as possible, because prolonged delays between the onset of symptoms and the beginning of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">immune globulin</a> replacement therapy are common and are associated with more extensive lung damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-variable-immunodeficiency-in-children/abstract/6,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,20</a>].</p><p>The diagnosis of CVID is based upon the findings of hypogammaglobulinemia, defective antibody formation, and exclusion of other causes of antibody deficiency.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1529357\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications for referral</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the patient's history and physical examination raise concern about a possible diagnosis of CVID, immunoglobulin levels should be evaluated initially. Referral to a clinical immunologist is indicated, whenever possible, to assess vaccine responsiveness and exclude other causes of hypogammaglobulinemia. Following diagnosis, immunology specialists can also determine the most appropriate therapies (such as prophylactic antibiotics and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">immune globulin</a>) and help monitor the patient for associated disorders. Most pediatric immunologists are versed in the care of children with CVID. In the United States, the Clinical Immunology Society [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-variable-immunodeficiency-in-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-variable-immunodeficiency-in-children/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], and the American College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-variable-immunodeficiency-in-children/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>] maintain databases of clinicians who have appropriate expertise in the care of patients with immunodeficiency.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2155544\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunoglobulin levels</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of CVID requires decreased immunoglobulin G (IgG) levels, in association with low levels of immunoglobulin A (IgA), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> immunoglobulin M (IgM). When assessing pediatric patients for hypogammaglobulinemia, it is important to use age-related normal values. A normal IgG level for children 6 to 16 years is about 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> with a 1 standard deviation range of 250, whereas children with CVID will typically have IgG levels below 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span>. IgM and IgA levels are also reduced but are less valuable in establishing a diagnosis. We also obtain an immunoglobulin E (IgE) level, which is useful in excluding other disorders and may indicate that the child has atopic disease. IgG subclass determinations are indicated if antibody titers are decreased but immunoglobulin levels are near normal. (See <a href=\"#H650981\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2155585\"><span class=\"h2\">Antibody function studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The demonstration of adequate antibody responses essentially excludes the diagnosis of CVID in young children. After obtaining a thorough vaccination history, we assess titers to diphtheria, tetanus, <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em>, and serotypes in the protein conjugated pneumococcal vaccine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F77758\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77758 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Evaluation of polysaccharide responses can be obtained after two years of age if the patient has received the unconjugated polysaccharide pneumococcal or <em>Neisseria meningitidis</em> vaccines.</p><p>The challenge in assessing specific antibody formation lies in correctly interpreting the significance of an impaired response, which may be truly pathologic or simply indicative of an immature immune system, particularly in the infant or child less than six years of age. Assessing the immune response to vaccination is reviewed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessing-the-immunologic-response-to-vaccination\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessing the immunologic response to vaccination&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2335351\"><span class=\"h2\">Other testing at the time of diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following additional tests may be appropriate:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A complete blood count and differential.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A low platelet count with microplatelets suggests a diagnosis of Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.

If B or T cells are decreased in number, we obtain tests of B and T cell function.

Many reference laboratories can do these studies. In a small series of predominantly pediatric patients, 8 of 15 patients had low peripheral B cell counts.

It was also not uncommon to detect a deficiency of CD27+IgM-IgD- switched memory B cells. In a study of 45 pediatric patients, 53 percent had lower switched memory B cells, CD19+ B cell levels, and T cell counts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-variable-immunodeficiency-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Those children with fewer than five switched memory B <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microliter</span> had a higher incidence of meningitis, sepsis bronchiectasis, granulomatous lung disease, autoimmune cytopenias, and hematologic malignancy. A second series confirmed this, but found that serious infectious complications were not restricted to this subgroup and also occurred in patients with higher numbers of switched memory B cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-variable-immunodeficiency-in-children/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].

After this period of time has elapsed, the patient's IgG should be compared with the last trough level before the final immune globulin treatment, in order to appreciate the patient's current level of antibody deficiency. Also at this time, specific antibody titers to various vaccines can be drawn, immunization with killed vaccines given (eg, pneumococcal vaccine, <em>H. influenzae</em> vaccine, and tetanus vaccine), and the specific antibody titers repeated in one month.

However, in most cases, we encourage the children to pursue whatever they wish in terms of physical activities, pending consultation with general pediatricians, because of the psychosocial benefits and long-term good health habits that sports and hobbies provide.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H301175\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The lifespan of children with CVID has been significantly lengthened since <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">immune globulin</a> replacement therapy became standard of care, and prognosis is good. Unfortunately, information about patients diagnosed in childhood is limited.</p><p>Death during childhood from complications of CVID is extremely rare once <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">immune globulin</a> replacement therapy is instituted. Quality of life improves as complications are appropriately managed. There is no evidence that patients diagnosed in childhood fare better or worse than those diagnosed later in life, provided diagnosis occurs before pulmonary structural issues develop. Those children diagnosed after irreversible pulmonary disease has developed may have a shorter lifespan, based upon findings in adults with CVID. However, specific data about children are lacking. Likewise, long-term outcome studies of patients with very low numbers of switched memory B cells or low T cell numbers have not been performed.</p><p>In children, evaluation of peripheral B cell maturation predicted the need for immunoglobulin G replacement and presence of enteropathy, granulomata formation, autoimmune cytopenias, and lymphoproliferation. However, more pediatric studies with long-term follow-up to adulthood will be required before the use of immune markers can be recommended to guide management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/common-variable-immunodeficiency-in-children/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>The prognosis of CVID in all age groups considered together is reviewed separately.

While CVID is often regarded as a disease of adults, it does affect children, and diagnosis in young children is difficult, particularly in children two to six years of age.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 25 percent of all CVID patients present in childhood, with a peak in diagnosis around eight years of age. (See <a href=\"#H10572319\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In all age groups, sinopulmonary infections and complications of infections are the most common presentation. However, children have more problems with ear infections, and certain disorders, such as autoimmune cytopenias and allergic disease, are more prominent in pediatric series. In addition, children may present with failure-to-thrive. (See <a href=\"#H10572368\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of CVID is based upon the findings of hypogammaglobulinemia, defective antibody formation (ie, vaccine response), and exclusion of other causes of antibody deficiency. Diagnosis in young children is difficult, because there are several causes of hypogammaglobulinemia that must be excluded and because response to polysaccharide antigens is normally weak in young children. Definitive diagnosis may not be possible until the child has undergone serial evaluations over a period of years. (See <a href=\"#H10572433\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H650981\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of CVID is similar in adults and children. Important aspects include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">immune globulin</a> replacement therapy, avoidance of infection, monitoring of pulmonary status, and vigilance for known associated disorders, such as cytopenias and malignancy. Issues that are of special importance in children include monitoring of physical and emotional development, early intervention for psychosocial and educational problems, and attention to cumulative radiation exposure resulting from radiologic studies.
