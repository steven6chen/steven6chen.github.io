The main left bundle branch penetrates the membranous portion of the interventricular septum under the aortic ring and then divides into several fairly discrete branches (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F63340\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63340 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-anterior-fascicular-block/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. There is a large amount of individual variability in the size and distribution of the left fascicles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-anterior-fascicular-block/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, in most patients, there are two main fascicles:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The left anterior fascicle that crosses the left ventricular outflow tract and terminates in the Purkinje system of the anterolateral wall of the left ventricle.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The left posterior fascicle that fans out extensively inferiorly and posteriorly into Purkinje fibers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In up to 65 percent of hearts, a left median (also called medial or septal) fascicle to the interventricular septum. This is found in nearly 65 percent of people and can arise from the common left bundle or from the anterior, posterior, or both fascicles.</p><p/><p>Support for the trifascicular nature of the left bundle comes from the observation in animals and humans that depolarization of the left ventricle begins in three areas corresponding to the terminal portions of the anterior, posterior, and septal fascicles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-anterior-fascicular-block/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. In the normal heart, the three fascicles of the left bundle are simultaneously depolarized. Further evidence of simultaneous activation of the fascicles can be found with routine electroanatomic mapping of a structurally normal heart. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=invasive-cardiac-electrophysiology-studies#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Invasive cardiac electrophysiology studies&quot;, section on 'Mapping and ablation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood supply</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The left anterior and median fascicles are supplied either by septal branches of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery or by the atrioventricular (AV) nodal artery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F70956\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70956 \">figure 2</a>). The proximal part of the left posterior fascicle is supplied by the artery to the AV node and, at times, by septal branches of the LAD artery. The distal portion has a dual blood supply from both anterior and posterior septal perforating arteries.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11192933\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Estimates of the prevalence of LAFB in the general adult population range from 1 to 2.5 percent. However, the incidence of LAFB increases with age and ranges from 0.2 percent in younger adults to 8.0 percent in patients older than 90 years of age. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a cohort from the late 1970s that included 16,600 life insurance applicants, a 2.5 percent incidence of isolated LAFB was noted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-anterior-fascicular-block/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among a cohort of 6416 people participating in a Finnish public health study, an overall 1 percent incidence of LAFB was observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-anterior-fascicular-block/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Additionally, the association between LAFB and increasing age was specifically described with LAFB prevalence increasing from 0.2 percent in those younger than 45 to 2.3 percent in those participants who were 55 and older [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-anterior-fascicular-block/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study evaluating the ECG findings in 888 patients age 90 years or older, 8 percent had isolated LAFB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-anterior-fascicular-block/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H322478109\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The left anterior fascicle is often a discrete ramus that crosses the left ventricular outflow tract and can be damaged by high flow, high pressure, and turbulence as occurs with aortic valvular disease, hypertension, and cardiomyopathies. LAFB can also occur in coronary heart disease, Chagas disease, infiltrative and inflammatory diseases, congenital heart diseases (including tricuspid atresia, endocardial cushion defects, single ventricle, spontaneous and surgical closure of a ventricular septal defect, and other disorders), and as part of a primary sclerodegenerative disorder, such as Len&egrave;gre's and Lev's diseases. Aortic valve surgery not uncommonly causes LAFB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-anterior-fascicular-block/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. LAFB occurs in over 70 percent of patients with obstructive sleep apnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-anterior-fascicular-block/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>LAFB has been associated with significant disease in the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery and rarely has been induced by ischemia during exercise testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-anterior-fascicular-block/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. LAFB that develops during an acute inferior wall myocardial infarction may be an indicator of LAD lesions, multivessel coronary artery disease, and impaired left ventricular systolic function, and occurs more frequently in a left-dominant or balanced coronary artery system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-anterior-fascicular-block/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2557650469\"><span class=\"h2\">Association with atrial fibrillation and heart failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While LAFB is not felt to be causative for the development of atrial fibrillation (AF) or heart failure, it may represent a marker for cardiac fibrosis, which does have a pathophysiologic role in AF. In the Cardiovascular Health Study (a prospective cohort of 4696 subjects followed for an average of 13 years), LAFB was associated with the development of AF (hazard ratio [HR] 2.1, 95% CI 1.1-3.9) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-anterior-fascicular-block/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Among a subset of patients from the Cardiovascular Health Study (a cohort of individuals aged 65 years or older sampled for the United States Medicare eligibility lists), in which 38 individuals with LAFB were compared with 1625 without, LAFB was associated with increased risk of death (HR 1.6, 95% CI 1.1-2.3), AF (HR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1-3.2), and heart failure (HR 2.4, 95% CI 1.4-4.1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-anterior-fascicular-block/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

The initial anterior paraseptal activation is absent in LAFB, while the remaining activation fronts caused by the posterior and median fascicles are normal. The net effect is a late leftward and superior vector and includes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>S waves in the inferior leads, resulting in an rS pattern in II, III, and aVF.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>R waves in the leftward leads, resulting in a qR or R (depending upon the initial right or left orientation) pattern in leads I, aVL, V5, and V6.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because of the left axis deviation, the QRS complex in aVR and aVL ends in an R wave. There may also be a persistent terminal S wave in leads V5 and V6 due to the delayed activation of the high lateral wall that is normally activated by the left anterior fascicle. The S waves disappear if the precordial electrograms are recorded two interspaces higher.</p><p/><p>The terminal vectors are more superior and also to the left and posterior. The very last terminal components may be directed slightly to the right or left. There is, however, a spectrum of LAFB that probably begins in the range of what is defined as having no axis deviation, through left axis deviation (-30&deg; to -44&deg;) to marked left axis deviation (-45&deg; to -90&deg;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-anterior-fascicular-block/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">QRS duration and T waves</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The QRS duration in LAFB is often less than 100 msec, although the World Health <span class=\"nowrap\">Organization/International</span> Society and Federation of Cardiology Task Force allows up to 120 msec or 20 msec above the previous baseline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-anterior-fascicular-block/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The T waves are often normal, but the T wave vector may be directed anteriorly and downward.</p><p>LAFB may cause the S waves to disappear in leads I, aVL, and rarely in V5 and V6, thereby obscuring the diagnosis of right bundle branch block (RBBB). At times, the ECG pattern more resembles left bundle branch block (LBBB) than RBBB, which is one of the causes of RBBB simulating LBBB. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=right-bundle-branch-block\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Right bundle branch block&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ECG in LAFB can mimic the findings seen in a number of other conditions. These include:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2744433594\"><span class=\"h2\">Old myocardial infarction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior myocardial infarction (MI), with resulting Q waves, may appear similar to LAFB on an ECG. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-tutorial-myocardial-ischemia-and-infarction#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ECG tutorial: Myocardial ischemia and infarction&quot;, section on 'Prior Q wave myocardial infarction'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An anteroseptal or even lateral MI may be suspected because of the QS pattern in V1 and V2 and the qR pattern in aVL. The Q waves in the precordial leads (eg, V1 and V2) are due to the inferior orientation of the initial vector. They may disappear in the precordial leads if the ECG leads are positioned one interspace lower.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Small r waves in the inferior leads with the superior axis deviation may be confused with an inferior wall MI, particularly since approximately one-third of patients with an inferior infarct can reestablish small r waves in the inferior leads. There are a number of findings that help distinguish an inferior MI from LAFB. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Persistent ST-T abnormalities suggest a prior inferior MI, while most patients with LAFB have normal T waves. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Inferior MI is usually associated with Q waves. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Vectorcardiography may be helpful in this setting since the vector loop in the frontal plane is counterclockwise with LAFB versus clockwise with an inferior infarct. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-tutorial-electrical-components-of-the-ecg#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ECG tutorial: Electrical components of the ECG&quot;, section on 'Electrical fields'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3356986431\"><span class=\"h2\">Left ventricular hypertrophy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The orientation of the midtemporal vector in LAFB may mimic left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in leads I and aVL and, conversely, may conceal signs of LVH in the left precordial leads. Debate continues to exist about whether LAFB alone may cause tall R waves in I and aVL in the absence of LVH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-anterior-fascicular-block/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In general, LVH does not shift the axis more leftward than -30&deg;. However, LVH and LAFB may coexist. Clues to concomitant LVH with a QRS axis of -45&deg; or more leftward include evidence of left atrial abnormality, prominent precordial voltage, ST-T changes consistent with LV overload (formerly called the &quot;strain&quot; pattern), and possibly a QRS duration of 120 msec or more. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=electrocardiographic-diagnosis-of-left-ventricular-hypertrophy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Electrocardiographic diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3600350944\"><span class=\"h2\">Pre-excitation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pre-excitation can occasionally produce left axis deviation. The presence of pre-excitation is indicated by a short PR interval, a delta wave, and a widened QRS complex. This pattern often has Q waves in leads II, III, and aVF and not infrequently is misdiagnosed as an inferior wall MI. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-wolff-parkinson-white-syndrome#H13260510\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome&quot;, section on 'Electrocardiographic findings'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H477965363\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulmonary disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Severe chronic pulmonary disease (emphysematous type) may at times produce marked left axis deviation (approximately -90&deg;). Findings suggestive of emphysema include a negative P wave in aVL, slow R wave progression reflecting right ventricular dilation, and downward displacement of the diaphragm. In addition, S waves may be present in leads I, II, and III.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H149872247\"><span class=\"h2\">Miscellaneous</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of conditions may alter the appearance of the ECG and present diagnostic problems, including an anatomically horizontal heart, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, straight back syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-anterior-fascicular-block/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], and some types of congenital heart disease including corrected transposition, tricuspid atresia, single ventricle, endocardial cushion malformations, and Ebstein's disease. If the S wave in standard lead II is deeper than in lead III, the diagnosis of LAFB is unlikely. Not infrequently, other diagnostic approaches, such as echocardiography, radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging, and, with suspected pre-excitation, electrophysiologic studies, are required to clarify these issues.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION, TREATMENT, AND FOLLOW-UP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with isolated LAFB are generally asymptomatic and do not require further diagnostic evaluation for LAFB or placement of a pacemaker or any other specific therapy. Therapy should be considered only in patients with persistent bifascicular or trifascicular block or in certain neuromuscular disorders. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-bifascicular-blocks\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic bifascicular blocks&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A number of neuromuscular diseases are associated with fascicular block. These include myotonic muscular dystrophy, Kearns-Sayre syndrome, Erb&rsquo;s dystrophy (limb-girdle), and a peroneal muscular atrophy. These patients represent a special class and are treated more aggressively with pacemakers due to the potential for unpredictably rapid progression of conduction disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-anterior-fascicular-block/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inherited-syndromes-associated-with-cardiac-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inherited syndromes associated with cardiac disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=permanent-cardiac-pacing-overview-of-devices-and-indications#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Permanent cardiac pacing: Overview of devices and indications&quot;, section on 'Neuromuscular diseases'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with isolated findings of LAFB on the surface ECG do not require any specific follow-up aside from routine care. Any symptoms consistent with the development of cardiac disease (eg, coronary heart disease, heart failure [HF], atrial fibrillation [AF], etc) should immediately be evaluated.</p><p>However, because LAFB is associated with a greater risk for subsequent development of AF and HF, patients should be aware of symptoms attributable to these conditions, and clinicians should screen these patients if there is any suggestive history.

In general, in the absence of apparent organic heart disease, isolated LAFB (ie, not associated with block in the other fascicles) is considered to be a benign consequence of aging with no causative impact on mortality, although its association with atrial fibrillation and heart failure possibly from cardiac fibrosis may result in associated morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-anterior-fascicular-block/abstract/16,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,21</a>].

At a mean follow-up of 41 months, bifascicular block with right bundle branch block and LAFB was associated with increased mortality, but isolated LAFB was not. With regard to possible progression of conduction disease, a retrospective study of patients in whom single-lead atrial pacing was used for sick sinus syndrome, a history of LAFB was not more frequent in the group that eventually required ventricular pacing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/left-anterior-fascicular-block/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].
