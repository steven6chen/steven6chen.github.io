It is more common in younger patients and in women. This topic will focus on non-atherosclerotic SCAD. Other aspects of coronary heart disease in women are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of coronary heart disease in women&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H436342795\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The underlying mechanism of non-atherosclerotic spontaneous coronary artery dissection (NA-SCAD) is not fully understood, but an intimal tear or bleeding of vasa vasorum with intramedial hemorrhage has been proposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-coronary-artery-dissection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Both result in creation of a false lumen filled with intramural hematoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-coronary-artery-dissection/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Pressure-driven expansion of the false lumen by an enlarging hematoma may lead to luminal encroachment and subsequent myocardial ischemia and infarction. Atherosclerotic SCAD is a mechanistically distinct variant of SCAD and is typically limited in extent by medial atrophy and scarring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-coronary-artery-dissection/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. NA-SCAD, on the other hand, can result in extensive dissection lengths, especially in the presence of arterial fragility from predisposing arteriopathies, and intracoronary imaging studies clearly show the absence of atherosclerosis in these cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-coronary-artery-dissection/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>In pregnant or early postpartum women, dissection may be a consequence of increased physiological hemodynamic stresses or from hormonal effects weakening the coronary arterial wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-coronary-artery-dissection/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. The exposure to recurrent and chronic hormonal pregnancy changes can further increase SCAD risks in women with multiple previous births (multiparity), and dissection in all arterial beds are more common during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-coronary-artery-dissection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-heart-disease-and-pregnancy#H4171842\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired heart disease and pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Myocardial infarction'</a>.)</p><p>Intramural hematoma involving the outer two-thirds of the media is common. Histologically, an inflammatory reaction (eg, eosinophilic infiltrates) in the adventitia has been described, suggestive of periarteritis that may breakdown the medial-adventitial layer predisposing the artery to dissection. However, this inflammatory response may be reactive rather than causative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-coronary-artery-dissection/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>One retrospective study has proposed that coronary artery tortuosity may be a marker for or a potential mechanism for SCAD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-coronary-artery-dissection/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In this study, the coronary angiograms of 246 patients with SCAD were compared with 313 controls. Tortuosity, as defined by the presence of &ge;3 consecutive curvatures of 90 to 180 degrees measured at end-diastole in a major epicardial coronary artery &ge;2 mm in diameter, was found in 78 and 17 percent, respectively. However, the presence of coronary tortuosity was also associated with extracoronary vasculopathy (eg, fibromuscular dysplasia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-coronary-artery-dissection/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]; as such, it is more likely that the tortuosity, similar to dissection, is a manifestation of the underlying predisposing vasculopathy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H97974664\"><span class=\"h1\">DISEASE ASSOCIATIONS AND CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most cases, a predisposing arterial disease association or cause is identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-coronary-artery-dissection/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, up to 20 percent of cases are labeled as idiopathic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-coronary-artery-dissection/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Most patients presenting with this entity typically do not have conventional risk factors for coronary heart disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-coronary-artery-dissection/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. </p><p>Potential predisposing factors include fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD), postpartum status, multiparity (&ge;4 births), connective tissue disorders, systemic inflammatory conditions, and hormonal therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-coronary-artery-dissection/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromuscular-dysplasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of fibromuscular dysplasia&quot;</a>.) </p><p>In a study of 168 patients with SCAD, one or more of these was found in about 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-coronary-artery-dissection/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In this study, which screened all patients with invasive or noninvasive angiography of the cerebral, iliac, or renal circulations, FMD was diagnosed in 72 percent in one or more territories. Other studies have also found a high percent of patients have extracoronary vascular abnormalities, including fibromuscular dysplasia, dissection, tortuosity, and aneurysms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-coronary-artery-dissection/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In contrast, association with systemic inflammatory conditions appeared to account for a small proportion of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-coronary-artery-dissection/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p>In a small proportion of cases, SCAD can be associated with connective tissue diseases such as Marfan&rsquo;s syndrome or Ehlers-Danlos type IV, where medial degeneration has been proposed to weaken the arterial wall and predispose to spontaneous dissections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-coronary-artery-dissection/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-ehlers-danlos-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Ehlers-Danlos syndromes&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Precipitating stressors that increase cardio-circulatory stress can provoke the acute spontaneous coronary artery dissection event (especially on a background of predisposing arteriopathy), and were reported in over 50 percent of cases in a contemporary series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-coronary-artery-dissection/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. These stressors include intense exercise or emotional stress, labor and delivery, intense Valsalva-type activities, recreational drug uses, and aggressive hormonal therapy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H436342802\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the general population, spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) is the cause of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in 0.1 to 0.4 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-coronary-artery-dissection/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. It is increasingly acknowledged to be an important cause of ACS in women. In fact, it has been reported to account for nearly a quarter of cases of ACS in women &le;50 years old [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-coronary-artery-dissection/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In two studies of 87 and 168 patients, the mean age was 43 and 52 years and 82 and 92 percent were women, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-coronary-artery-dissection/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Although classically thought to affect young women, SCAD is now increasingly recognized to also occur in older and postmenopausal women. In the 168 patient-cohort, almost 60 percent were over age 50, and 62 percent of women affected were postmenopausal. Men can also present with SCAD (&lt;10 to 15 percent of cases); however, mechanistically, these are more likely atherosclerotic in origin than non-atherosclerotic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-coronary-artery-dissection/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H436342809\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with non-atherosclerotic spontaneous coronary artery dissection (NA-SCAD) usually present with symptoms and signs characteristic of acute myocardial infarction (MI).

Criteria for the angiographic definition include the presence of a non-iatrogenic dissection plane in the absence of coronary atherosclerosis, with typical changes of radiolucent intimal flap and contrast staining. However, a contemporary angiographic series has shown that such stereotypical changes were seen in only &lt;30 percent of non-atherosclerotic -SCAD (NA-SCAD) cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-coronary-artery-dissection/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

However, the optimal management is uncertain, in part due to the limited clinical experience. A wide range of approaches, including conservative management, emergency revascularization with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG), fibrinolytic therapy (with or without subsequent PCI), mechanical hemodynamic support, and cardiac transplantation have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-coronary-artery-dissection/abstract/12,20,21,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,20,21,28</a>].</p><p>Patients presenting with acute myocardial infarction who have symptoms of ongoing ischemia or hemodynamic compromise should be considered for revascularization with PCI or coronary artery bypass grafting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-coronary-artery-dissection/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. However, revascularization in patients with SCAD is technically challenging and associated with higher failure rates or complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-coronary-artery-dissection/abstract/12,13,27,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13,27,29</a>]. Until further evidence is available to guide therapy, a conservative approach is recommended in patients with non-critical luminal obstruction, normal TIMI grade 3 flow (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F51941\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51941 \">table 1</a>), and a stable clinical situation. The utility of follow-up stress testing or coronary angiography is not known. </p><p>Many patients have been managed with long-term <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, beta blocker, and one year of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a>, with the addition of a statin in patients with dyslipidemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-coronary-artery-dissection/abstract/12,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,30</a>]. Ongoing prospective studies on SCAD should further elucidate the medical management of this challenging and relatively unexplored condition (NCT02188069 and NCT02008786).</p><p>PCI with SCAD is often technically challenging in part due to fragility of the vessel wall. Retaining coronary guidewires within the true lumen can be challenging. Any instrumentation (wiring, angioplasty, or stenting) can propagate dissection and occlude side branches. In addition, dissections often affect small caliber distal vessels and are extensive, requiring long stents with high likelihood of subsequent in-stent restenosis. Furthermore, temporal resolution of intramural hematoma in previously stented segments may increase the risk of late stent malapposition and stent thrombosis. Thus, PCI should only be pursued when there is a strong clinical indication, and consideration should be given to utilizing adjunctive intracoronary imaging to optimize stent strut apposition. The use of bioabsorbable stents may have theoretical advantages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/spontaneous-coronary-artery-dissection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H436342830\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Information regarding the prognosis of patients with spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD) comes from small series in which management varied.
