Cognitive-behavioral therapy usually includes nutritional rehabilitation and also addresses dysfunctional thoughts and problematic behaviors that maintain the disorder.

These symptoms often resolve for the majority of patients as they gain weight. If depressive and anxiety disorders persist after weight and physical health (including menstruation) are restored, pharmacotherapy may be indicated. Comorbid depressive and anxiety disorders are discussed separately.

The sample included patients (n = 63) who had anorexia nervosa for at least seven years; the average duration of illness was approximately 17 years. Both treatments provided 30 sessions of individual treatment. The retention rate for modified CBT was high (85 percent), compared with the retention rate in typical CBT for anorexia nervosa (approximately 50 percent). In addition, quality of life at the end of treatment was improved in patients who received modified CBT. At the six-month follow-up, patients who received modified CBT reported further improvement in social adjustment and reduced eating disorder psychopathology.

The efficacy of pharmacotherapy for anorexia nervosa is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-pharmacotherapy#H3028991\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anorexia nervosa in adults: Pharmacotherapy&quot;, section on 'Evidence of efficacy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13320148\"><span class=\"h1\">THEORETICAL FOUNDATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cognitive-behavioral model of therapy focuses upon the clinical features that maintain anorexia nervosa, rather than the factors that led to onset of the disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-cbt/abstract/8,11,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,11,21</a>]. The theory is that the cognitive and behavioral disturbances that are present in patients frequently become self-reinforcing and self-perpetuating, and eventually uncoupled from the original factors that cause anorexia nervosa.</p><p>The predominant maintaining mechanisms in anorexia nervosa are problems with self-evaluation and self-esteem, such that patients judge themselves primarily in terms of body weight and shape, and the ability to control them [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-cbt/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Patients pursue thinness because they believe this will provide a sense of control, mastery, and self-worth. These dysfunctional cognitions lead to behavioral problems such that patients restrict the quantity and variety of foods to become thin, and may also overexercise and purge (eg, self-induced vomiting and laxative abuse). Feelings of low self-esteem are mitigated as patients maintain strict dietary rules and a low weight. Starvation leads to increased food preoccupation, which patients view as a threat to controlling food intake; the result is increased efforts to restrict eating. As anorexia nervosa becomes more entrenched, control over eating, thinness, and low weight dominate the patient&rsquo;s self-concept and sense of effectiveness.</p><p>The cognitive-behavioral therapy model recognizes that predisposing biologic, environmental, and temperament factors increase the risk for developing anorexia nervosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-cbt/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>], and that patients can benefit from addressing these factors on a limited basis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-cbt/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. As an example, the genetics of the disorder are discussed in the psychoeducational component of cognitive-behavioral therapy, and clinicians work with patients to explore their perfectionism, anxiety, mood dysregulation, motivation, and interpersonal problems. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H173160193\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is a time-limited, structured, manual-based treatment that combines cognitive therapy and behavior therapy, and emphasizes changing dysfunctional cognitions (thoughts and beliefs about body weight and shape) and behavioral disturbances (eg, excessive food restriction) that perpetuate anorexia nervosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-cbt/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16424532\"><span class=\"h2\">Format and setting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CBT is included in nearly all day hospital and inpatient programs for anorexia nervosa as one of several interventions and generally administered within group therapy. Outpatient CBT is usually administered as individual (one to one) therapy. Many inpatient and day treatment programs enable patients to gain weight, but continuing outpatient care is nearly always necessary to prevent weight loss and promote more complete resolution of the eating disorder. Outpatients should understand at the outset the clinical conditions that will require more intensive treatment in a partial hospital or inpatient program, and agree to follow the clinician&rsquo;s recommendations. Alternative treatment for nonresponders is discussed elsewhere in this topic. (See <a href=\"#H626656\" class=\"local\">'Nonresponders'</a> below.)</p><p>At least one session of individual CBT includes both the patient and family members (or significant others) who are regularly involved with the patient. The family meeting is used to discuss the patient&rsquo;s progress, how the family can help, and identify problems such as negative comments about the patient&rsquo;s shape or weight. In addition, it may be necessary to involve family members for patients who are deteriorating; this should be discussed and agreed upon at the beginning of therapy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16424525\"><span class=\"h2\">Therapeutic relationship</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The therapeutic relationship in CBT for anorexia nervosa is based upon clinicians and patients collaborating to resolve the disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-cbt/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Clinicians are generally active in structuring and directing treatment, especially at the beginning. However, the clinician does not lead treatment; rather, the clinician and patient work jointly on each component of treatment. This requires the clinician to be open, empathic, respectful, and flexible. </p><p>Some studies suggest that the therapeutic alliance between the patient and therapist affects treatment outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-cbt/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. As an example, in an eight-month randomized trial that compared CBT with specialist supportive clinical management (n = 63 outpatients), the therapeutic alliance in the two groups was comparable, and follow-up assessments 12 months posttreatment found that a stronger therapeutic alliance was associated with greater improvement in body mass index and eating disorder psychopathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-cbt/abstract/25,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,31</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H679010935\"><span class=\"h2\">Goals</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goals of CBT include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-cbt/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight gain</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Increasing food quantity and variety</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Changing distorted perceptions of body weight and shape </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reducing fears of becoming fat</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reducing the importance of thinness relative to other areas of life, such as family, work, friends, and recreation </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Improving interpersonal relationships</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Understanding the onset and maintenance of the eating disorder </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Developing problem solving skills</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relapse prevention</p><p/><p>However, for patients with severe and enduring anorexia nervosa, the goals of treatment are modified, such that less emphasis is placed upon weight gain and symptom recovery, and more emphasis is placed upon engaging patient in treatment, harm reduction, and maximizing quality of life and functioning (see <a href=\"#H1919058170\" class=\"local\">'Severe and enduring anorexia nervosa'</a> below). Minimizing harm is important in this population, given that anorexia nervosa is associated with increased rates of all-cause mortality and suicide.

Shorter adaptations have been developed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-cbt/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], but outcomes may be superior with longer treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-cbt/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Although the phases are presented below in a sequence, the actual order is determined by the patient&rsquo;s symptoms, and many elements (eg, motivational enhancement) are repeated throughout treatment as needed. In addition, if patients begin to lose weight, the focus of therapy returns to weight gain.

The formulation focuses primarily upon cognitive and behavioral disturbances maintaining the eating disorder and secondarily on vulnerability factors that may have contributed to developing anorexia nervosa. Discussing the formulation with patients often helps them organize previously chaotic and poorly understood experiences. This discussion leads to an overview of treatment, in which clinicians explain the:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Principles of CBT</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Need to complete homework (usually daily behavioral experiments) in between sessions </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Logistics, including schedule for sessions and policies for tardiness, missed appointments, emergencies, and payment </p><p/><p>Following the overview, the first priority generally is to enhance motivation for recovery, which is often an ongoing issue throughout treatment.

This ambivalence is addressed with motivational interviewing or enhancement, which first attempts to help patients acknowledge they have a problem, make a commitment to changing their behavior, and take action to change [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-cbt/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].

In addition, inappropriate compensatory behaviors and thoughts and feelings while eating are recorded. Diary entries are discussed at the following session.

It is often necessary to begin with small behavioral changes that are positively reinforcing; these changes provide opportunities to explore and challenge the cognitions that perpetuate the eating pathology. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13320241\"><span class=\"h3\">Weight gain protocol, meal planning, and preventing weight loss</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For underweight patients with anorexia nervosa, a preliminary weight gain goal is established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-cbt/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Ultimately, the goal is a healthy weight, which typically requires a BMI &ge;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</span> </sup>(<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-body-mass-index-bmi-quetelets-index-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>). However, this amount is overwhelming to many patients, and thus a series of more manageable, step-wise weight gain goals is usually established during the course of treatment. As an example, an initial goal of gaining 2 to 3 kilograms is set, and once that is achieved, the next goal is set. The desired outcome is steady weight gain, even if the rate is slow. Weight monitoring is used to track progress with weight gain.</p><p>Developing meal plans can help patients with anorexia nervosa gain weight. The initial focus is upon meeting caloric goals, and caloric intake is gradually increased to enable patients to gain 0.5 to 1.0 kilogram per week. Subsequently greater emphasis is placed upon the quality and variety of food. For clinicians who lack expertise in teaching patients what, how much, and when to eat, we suggest referring the patient to a nutritionist. Self-monitoring is used to track eating and develop normal habits.</p><p>Once patients with anorexia nervosa achieve a healthy weight, treatment focuses upon weight maintenance. Most patients need to eat more than they expect to maintain their target weight. Relapse is thus common because many patients fear that healthy eating will cause excessive weight gain. Old eating patterns may be resumed, leading patients to shave calories, decrease portion size, and skip supplements and added fats (as well as increase exercise). Cutting back soon after restoring a healthy weight inevitably leads to weight loss, which is associated with relapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-cbt/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Clinicians should encourage patients to approach weight maintenance as an experiment, using weight monitoring to track weight and gather evidence about what happens if the meal plan is maintained.</p><p>Weight monitoring and self-monitoring are discussed elsewhere in this topic. (See <a href=\"#H173160068\" class=\"local\">'Self-monitoring and weight monitoring'</a> above.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13320248\"><span class=\"h3\">Behavioral experiments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with anorexia nervosa, CBT emphasizes experiments with different behaviors between sessions, beginning with actions that lead to healthy eating and weight gain. Subsequently, behavioral experiments address cognitive distortions and interpersonal relationships. </p><p>CBT includes tasks that occur outside of sessions. This &ldquo;homework&rdquo; is an integral component of therapy that is discussed and reviewed from session to session. The amount of effort that patients make to complete this work often depends upon how much attention it receives from clinicians. In addition, patients are more likely to value and complete homework that is developed collaboratively. Completed tasks are praised for the effort made, and tasks that are not completed prompt a discussion about the challenges and patient&rsquo;s motivation.</p><p>The clinician and patient initially generate behavioral experiments to increase both food quantity and variety. In developing meal plans to increase food quantity for a particular meal, patients should not compensate by decreasing the quantity of food at other meals. Experiments to increase food variety begin with patients articulating a hierarchy of forbidden foods. As an example, lettuce may be the least feared food, with progressively more fear attached to cucumbers, apples, and bread, and the most fear attached to ice cream. Patients incorporate small quantities of the least feared foods into their meals and progressively increase the challenge. Failures are addressed during sessions, and successes provide the basis for the next incremental challenge until the food quantity and variety is sufficient to sustain a healthy weight and nutritional health. Success enables the patient to enjoy the range of social experiences involving food.</p><p>Behavioral tasks are subsequently designed to address other aspects of anorexia nervosa, including preoccupation with body weight and shape, excessive exercise, and social isolation. This includes finding alternatives to reading women&rsquo;s fashion magazines (which often promote thinness as an ideal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-cbt/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]) and visiting websites and social media that promote anorexia nervosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-cbt/abstract/37-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-40</a>], as well as interpersonal challenges such as attending a party or initiating a social activity. &#160; &#160; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13320255\"><span class=\"h3\">Identifying and challenging dysfunctional thoughts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients are encouraged to examine dysfunctional thoughts about themselves (eg, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t eat anymore or I&rsquo;ll become fat&rdquo;) and substitute more functional thoughts (eg, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard for me to concentrate at work when I don&rsquo;t eat enough&rdquo;). This process begins with clinicians initially pointing out cognitive distortions as they emerge and then gradually working with patients to understand how dysfunctional thoughts and associated behavioral disturbances maintain anorexia nervosa. Clinicians typically ask a series of questions that test the logic of the thoughts, which helps patients learn to challenge the validity of maladaptive thoughts, examine the evidence for the thoughts, and explore alternative explanations for their situation. As an example, homework can include testing a faulty cognition by discussing it with friends. In addition, dysfunctional thoughts about body shape and weight are restructured by discussing the importance of shape and weight relative to other areas of life, including family, work, friends, and recreational activities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13320269\"><span class=\"h3\">Addressing body checking and body avoidance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical features associated with anorexia nervosa include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-cbt/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Body checking &ndash; Excessively evaluating one&rsquo;s physical appearance by repeatedly weighing oneself, measuring body parts, and looking in the mirror to assess shape</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Body avoidance &ndash; Refusing to view one&rsquo;s physical appearance by refusing to be weighed, avoiding mirrors, and wearing baggy clothes to conceal one&rsquo;s shape </p><p/><p>Body checking and body avoidance can perpetuate dietary restraint and body image disturbance (thin patients thinking that they are overweight).

It is typically recommended that patients refrain from all exercise until they have maintained a minimum target weight for one to two months.

Long distance running and high intensity aerobics are generally avoided.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13320283\"><span class=\"h2\">Phase 3: Schema-based cognitive therapy and related clinical issues</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Schemas are core beliefs about oneself and the surrounding world that influence how individuals process information [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-cbt/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. As an example, patients with anorexia nervosa may believe that they are unlovable, and if a friend declines an invitation to see a movie, it is because the friend views the patient as &ldquo;no good.&rdquo; The schema prevents the patient from considering alternative, rational possibilities for the friend&rsquo;s behavior (eg, the friend has a prior commitment or has already seen the movie). &#160; </p><p>For patients with anorexia nervosa who achieve a stable, minimal target weight, clinicians can proceed with schema-based cognitive therapy that focuses upon the overriding belief that self-worth is predicated upon thinness and the ability to control weight. This cognitive schema explains why the psychopathology of anorexia nervosa is egosyntonic (consistent with the patient&rsquo;s ideal self-image), in contrast to most other mental disorders. Patients with anorexia nervosa choose to starve themselves and maintain a low weight because they overvalue both. The schema operates automatically and without full awareness on the part of the patient, which partially accounts for the stability of the disorder and its resistance to change [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-cbt/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>].</p><p>Schema-based work aims to make the self-schema (self-worth = thinness) and its assumptions explicit, and then to challenge its maladaptive components [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-cbt/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. One component is the belief that &quot;I am thin and must stay this way because it brings me control, mastery, and makes me special.&quot; Therapy attempts to separate the goals of achieving control, mastery, and importance from the means (eg, restricting food intake) used to achieve them. Clinicians support the desire for mastery and self-importance but question whether anorexia nervosa helps patients achieve these goals. The next step consists of finding more adaptive strategies for acquiring a sense of control, enhancing self-worth, and defining oneself.</p><p>In addition to the eating disorder self-schema, CBT addresses other maladaptive schemata involving interpersonal relationships. Patients may believe that they must please everyone, are responsible for a loved one&rsquo;s problems, do not deserve the love of others, and must avoid conflict at all cost for fear that they will be rejected. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5722141\"><span class=\"h3\">Binge-eating and purging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many patients with anorexia nervosa binge eat (ie, eating an amount of food in a discrete period of time that is larger than most people would eat under similar circumstances) and purge (ie, use inappropriate compensatory behaviors to prevent weight gain, such as self-induced vomiting, abusing laxative and diuretics, or excessive exercise) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-cbt/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Purging should be closely monitored because it increases the risk of medical complications (eg, gastrointestinal problems and electrolyte imbalances), which are exacerbated by low weight. CBT interventions for binge-eating in patients with anorexia nervosa are similar to the interventions used in patients with bulimia nervosa, which are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bulimia-nervosa-in-adults-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-cbt#H647794\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bulimia nervosa in adults: Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)&quot;, section on 'Therapeutic techniques and content'</a>.) &#160;</p><p>Some patients with anorexia nervosa report subjective binge episodes that do not constitute objective binge-eating. For these patients, CBT focuses upon identifying and challenging the cognitive distortions that transform normal meals and snacks into subjective &quot;binges.&quot; Treatment should continue to focus upon eating three meals per day along with snacks, rather than changing the behavior that the patient describes as a binge. &#160;</p><p>Inappropriate compensatory behaviors are driven by the same dysfunctional thoughts that drive the excessive dietary restraint of anorexia nervosa, namely, that thinness will provide a sense of control, mastery, and self-worth. Treatment focuses upon exploring the thoughts and behaviors that trigger compensatory behaviors, and patients are encouraged to experiment with changing their behavior so that they can gather accurate information that tests their beliefs.</p><p>Binge-eating, purging, and the medical complications of these behaviors and anorexia nervosa are discussed separately.

Many patients describe low self-esteem; feeling unworthy of love; problems with attachment, dependency, and autonomy in relationships; and excessive dependency and mistrust. The therapeutic relationship between the clinician and patient can be used to explore the patient&rsquo;s feelings and assumptions about relationships in general. The clinician looks to identify dysfunctional schemas (core beliefs) that patients hold with regard to themselves or relationships and challenges these distortions. In addition, procedures used in dialectical behavioral therapy are often helpful for affecting regulation and improving interpersonal skills [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-cbt/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13320320\"><span class=\"h2\">Phase 4: Ending treatment and relapse prevention</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CBT for anorexia nervosa is nearly always time limited, which can help motivate patients throughout therapy.

Patient self-acceptance is more likely if clinicians can embrace the less-than-perfect recovery.</p><p>Relapse is common in patients who recover from an episode of anorexia nervosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-cbt/abstract/26,50-54\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,50-54</a>]; risk factors include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-cbt/abstract/27,35,50,53,55-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,35,50,53,55-58</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior episodes of anorexia nervosa requiring specialized treatment or hospitalization</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Longer lifetime duration of illness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Older age at the time of recovery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of suicide attempt</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More severe pretreatment caloric restriction</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Slower response to treatment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Less weight gain during treatment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Achieving a BMI &le;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</span> </sup>following treatment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight loss during the initial few weeks following care</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>More residual symptoms following acute recovery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Overvaluing weight to a greater degree following acute recovery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Body image distortion following acute recovery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persistent weight concern following acute recovery</p><p/><p>Patients with anorexia nervosa may be encouraged to hear that relapse in the short-term does not preclude long-term success [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-cbt/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H626656\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonresponders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CBT for anorexia nervosa should be reconsidered for patients who: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not adhere to treatment (eg, skip appointments or fail to complete homework) despite repeated efforts upon the part of the clinician</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Make an effort but achieve little or no progress after 10 sessions</p><p/><p>For nonresponsive patients, clinicians should use the range of CBT components that address dysfunctional concerns about body weight and shape, as well as modules that address perfectionism and interpersonal functioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-cbt/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Alternatively, other psychotherapies are available for anorexia nervosa, including specialist supportive clinical care, family therapy, cognitive-analytic therapy, interpersonal psychotherapy, or psychodynamic psychotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-cbt/abstract/29,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,59</a>].

For these patients, we suggest using the same CBT protocol (see <a href=\"#H260343048\" class=\"local\">'Therapeutic protocol'</a> above), but modifying the treatment goals to focus more upon stabilizing patients and less upon recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-cognitive-behavioral-therapy-cbt/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. The modified goals include adhering to treatment, minimizing harm, improving quality of life and functioning, and avoiding further experiences of failure that may lead to demoralization and helplessness. This approach takes into account the long-standing central role that the illness has played in the patient&rsquo;s life, as well as persistent neurocognitive deficits and the low level of motivation to change. Although weight gain and recovery from core features (eg, distorted perception of body weight and shape) of anorexia nervosa are encouraged, these become secondary goals. Nevertheless, medical safety remains a primary goal and is monitored. The efficacy of adapting CBT for severe and persistent anorexia nervosa is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"#H3295164065\" class=\"local\">'Severe-enduring illness'</a> above.) &#160; &#160;</p><p>Adapting CBT for severe and enduring anorexia nervosa is comparable to the approach taken for managing other chronic illnesses that may be refractory to treatment, such as unipolar depression. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unipolar-depression-in-adults-management-of-highly-resistant-refractory-depression#H807206\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unipolar depression in adults: Management of highly resistant (refractory) depression&quot;, section on 'General approach'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13320369\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The core clinical features of anorexia nervosa (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F91103\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91103 \">table 1</a>) are restricting energy intake, which leads to a significantly low body weight (defined as a weight that is less than minimally normal), given the patient&rsquo;s age, sex, developmental trajectory, and physical health; intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat, or persistent behavior that interferes with weight gain, despite a weight that is significantly low; and disturbance in how one experiences body weight and shape, undue influence of weight or shape on self-worth, or denial of the seriousness of one&rsquo;s low body weight. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-clinical-features-course-of-illness-assessment-and-diagnosis#H89471679\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anorexia nervosa in adults: Clinical features, course of illness, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial clinical evaluation of patients with a possible diagnosis of anorexia nervosa includes a psychiatric and general medical history, mental status and physical examination, and focused laboratory tests. If the patient was previously treated with cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), the clinician should establish which components were beneficial. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anorexia-nervosa-in-adults-clinical-features-course-of-illness-assessment-and-diagnosis#H89473592\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anorexia nervosa in adults: Clinical features, course of illness, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Assessment'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CBT plus other interventions, including nutritional rehabilitation, is indicated for treatment of low-weight patients with anorexia nervosa. In addition, CBT is efficacious for preventing relapse. Use of CBT requires sufficient motivation, cognitive capacity, emotional stability, and energy to participate in therapy. Contraindications to CBT include general medical instability, suicidal ideation or behavior, and psychosis. (See <a href=\"#H13320141\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above and <a href=\"#H460870\" class=\"local\">'Evidence of efficacy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H14436547\" class=\"local\">'Overview of treatment for anorexia nervosa'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eating-disorders-overview-of-prevention-and-treatment#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Eating disorders: Overview of prevention and treatment&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The cognitive-behavioral model of therapy focuses upon the clinical features that maintain anorexia nervosa. The predominant maintaining mechanisms are problems with self-evaluation and self-esteem, such that patients judge themselves primarily in terms of body weight and shape, and the ability to control them. (See <a href=\"#H13320148\" class=\"local\">'Theoretical foundation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CBT is a time-limited, structured, manual-based treatment that combines cognitive therapy and behavior therapy, and emphasizes changing current dysfunctional cognitions (thoughts and beliefs about body weight and shape) and behavioral disturbances (eg, excessive food restriction). (See <a href=\"#H173160193\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For outpatient treatment of anorexia nervosa with individual cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), we generally use a protocol that consists of four phases delivered in approximately 50 sessions over one year. Phase 1 aims to orient patients to treatment, enhance motivation, and introduce self-monitoring. Phase 2 employs interventions to change maladaptive cognitions and behaviors; the primary goal is weight gain and preventing weight loss. Phase 3 addresses the core belief that self-worth is predicated upon thinness and the ability to control weight. Phase 4 focuses upon relapse prevention. (See <a href=\"#H260343048\" class=\"local\">'Therapeutic protocol'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CBT can be adapted for severe and enduring anorexia nervosa, such that the principles and structure of CBT are retained, but the goals of treatment shift from weight gain and symptom recovery to harm reduction and maximizing quality of life.
