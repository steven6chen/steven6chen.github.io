Most infections are caused by inhalation of spores. The clinical expression of disease ranges from self-limited acute pneumonia (Valley Fever) to disseminated disease, especially in immunosuppressed patients. Cases of coccidioidomycosis in the United States are concentrated in the southwestern part of the country.</p><p>The clinical manifestations, specific diagnostic tests, and management strategies for primary infection will be reviewed here. Complicated infections related to coccidioidomycosis are discussed elsewhere.

All isolates within the genus <em>Coccidioides</em> were formerly designated <em>C. immitis</em>. However, based upon DNA sequence analysis, the two species have been identified as distinct [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-coccidioidal-infection/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. </p><p>Isolates from one species are geographically distributed predominantly in California, and have retained the name <em>C. immitis</em>. The other species is distributed in Arizona, Utah, Texas, and other endemic regions throughout the western hemisphere, and is now designated <em>C. posadasii</em>. However, the spectrums of diseases caused by the two species are indistinguishable, and clinical laboratories are not routinely able to determine species. For this reason, it is simplest to refer to all isolates as <em>Coccidioides</em> species.</p><p><em>Coccidioides</em> spp grow as mold a few inches below the surface of the desert soil. With dry conditions, the mycelia become very fragile, are easily fractured by even slight air turbulence into single-cell spores (arthroconidia) approximately 3 to 5 microns in size, and can remain suspended for prolonged periods of time in the air.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1198359612\"><span class=\"h2\">Geographic distribution</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Coccidioides</em> spp are endemic to certain lower deserts of the western hemisphere, including southern Arizona, the southern and central valleys of California, southwestern New Mexico, and west Texas in the United States. They are also found in parts of Mexico and Central and South America. </p><p>Occasional small pockets of endemicity have also been identified in more northern areas of the western United States. As an example, repeated infections have occurred at a specific American Indian archeology site in Dinosaur National Monument in Utah [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-coccidioidal-infection/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Cases of coccidioidomycosis have also developed in visitors to eastern Washington state, where <em>Coccidioides</em> spp were identified in the soil [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-coccidioidal-infection/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Whole-genome sequencing demonstrated genetic identity between an isolate from one of the patients and four soil isolates obtained from the area of exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-coccidioidal-infection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Increased reporting from all states might provide clues to other endemic pockets such as the one identified in Washington state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-coccidioidal-infection/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p>In the United States, the estimated number of infections per year is approximately 150,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-coccidioidal-infection/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p>A substantial increase in the incidence of coccidioidomycosis has been observed in endemic regions. In endemic states where coccidioidomycosis is reportable to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, and Utah), the incidence of coccidioidomycosis increased from 5.3 cases per 100,000 population in 1998 to 42.6 cases per 100,000 population in 2011 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-coccidioidal-infection/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Arizona and California account for 66 and 31 percent, respectively, of all nationally reported infections. In California, inmates of two state prisons have been disproportionately affected by coccidioidomycosis compared with the general population, with 180 cases recognized in 2005 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-coccidioidal-infection/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Several factors that account for much of the increase have been identified in Arizona. These include a shift to more sensitive serologic test results to define cases, year-to-year variation in precipitation, and a continued growth of the population in endemic areas. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-coccidioidal-infection/abstract/11,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk of infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Estimates of the risk of endemic exposure to <em>Coccidioides</em> spp are approximately 3 percent per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-coccidioidal-infection/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In addition, a telephone survey by the Arizona Department of Health Services of patients diagnosed with Valley Fever in 2007 found that the average time of residence was 16 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-coccidioidal-infection/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Thus, even persons who have lived in endemic regions for many years may still be susceptible to a new infection.</p><p>The risk of exposure within endemic regions is seasonal, typically being highest in dry periods following a rainy season. As an example, periods of high incidence in Arizona range from May into July and then between October and early December [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-coccidioidal-infection/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. By contrast, the central California valley, which rarely receives significant summer rain, has a single peak from late spring to late fall. </p><p>Based upon population sizes within the most highly endemic regions, it is estimated that approximately 60 percent of all United States coccidioidal infections occur within Maricopa, Pinal, and Pima counties of Arizona and 30 percent within Kern, Tulare, and San Luis Obispo counties of California. Cases reported to the United States <a href=\"http://www.cdc.gov/fungal/diseases/coccidioidomycosis/index.html&amp;token=7VGWRCbQXMvG9+rPNUMKP52OV355E8eFvFudmV1jo57IYv1uY37h2S2oqm4TOkm3PUmSxXJHMyIBDQ9/RDfGxjbm0t34T3s1i+sma4gpQ4Y=&amp;TOPIC_ID=2460\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> show similar geographic distributions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-coccidioidal-infection/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infection is virtually always acquired by inhalation of a single arthroconidium. Within the lung, an arthroconidium changes from a barrel-shaped cell to a spherical structure and then greatly enlarges, sometimes becoming 70 microns or more in diameter. Enlarging spherules produce internal septations, and, within each of the resulting subcompartments, individual cells (endospores) evolve.</p><p>After several days, mature spherules rupture, releasing endospores into the infected tissue; each endospore is potentially capable of producing another spherule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-coccidioidal-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Leukocytes collected by bronchoalveolar lavage from patients with acute coccidioidal pneumonia demonstrate that cellular immunity has been activated, as evidenced by increased interleukin-17, interferon-gamma, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha levels following in vitro stimulation with coccidioidal antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-coccidioidal-infection/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Organisms grown from patient specimens show a reversion to mycelia on most laboratory media [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-coccidioidal-infection/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1073167939\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H273761226\"><span class=\"h2\">Signs and symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is estimated that less than one-half of all infections come to medical attention because illness is often subclinical [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-coccidioidal-infection/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. The proportion of infections that become clinically significant increases in outbreaks with more intensive dust exposure. It is presumed that this represents higher arthroconidial inoculum exposure, as occurs during archeological excavations or desert military maneuvers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-coccidioidal-infection/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p>For those who develop symptoms, a wide spectrum of manifestations are possible. Primary infection due to <em>Coccidioides</em> species most frequently manifests as a community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) approximately 7 to 21 days after exposure. The most common presenting symptoms are chest pain, cough, and fever (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F69260\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69260 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-coccidioidal-infection/abstract/25-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-32</a>]. In a study from Pima County, Arizona, 29 percent of patients diagnosed with CAP were serologically positive for coccidioidal infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-coccidioidal-infection/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. If hemoptysis occurs, it suggests the development of a pulmonary cavity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-pulmonary-sequelae-and-complications-of-coccidioidomycosis#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of pulmonary sequelae and complications of coccidioidomycosis&quot;, section on 'Coccidioidal cavities'</a>.)</p><p>Some patients also develop systemic complaints, often lasting for weeks to months. Patients can experience constitutional symptoms, such as fever, drenching night sweats, and weight loss. Patients can also develop extreme fatigue that can interfere with activities of daily living, and may last for many months. (See <a href=\"#H21453818\" class=\"local\">'Prolonged fatigue'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients with early coccidioidal infection can also present with dermatologic or rheumatologic complaints. The frequent complaint of arthralgias has contributed to the alternate name of &quot;desert rheumatism&quot; for this illness. Cutaneous manifestations of primary coccidioidal infection include erythema nodosum and erythema multiforme. Erythema nodosum is much more common in women than in men, and often is the symptom prompting evaluation for Valley Fever. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythema-nodosum\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Erythema nodosum&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1117712947\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most routine laboratory findings are unremarkable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-coccidioidal-infection/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. A common but nonspecific abnormality is the erythrocyte sedimentation rate, which often is one- or twofold above the upper limits of normal. The peripheral blood leukocyte count is usually normal or only slightly elevated. However, eosinophilia (&gt;5 percent) was found in approximately one-quarter of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-coccidioidal-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In occasional patients, eosinophilia can be striking.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1228570242\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although initial infections usually have a respiratory component, standard posteroanterior and lateral chest radiographs may be unremarkable in up to one-half of all patients. Common radiographic abnormalities include unilateral infiltrate and ipsilateral hilar adenopathy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F76967\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef76967 \">image 1</a>). Less frequent is evidence of a parapneumonic effusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-coccidioidal-infection/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Peripheral thin-walled pulmonary cavities or nodules are detected in 4 to 8 percent of all patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F51795\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef51795 \">image 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-coccidioidal-infection/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Rare cases of empyema have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-coccidioidal-infection/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-pulmonary-sequelae-and-complications-of-coccidioidomycosis#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of pulmonary sequelae and complications of coccidioidomycosis&quot;, section on 'Coccidioidal cavities'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1017503989\"><span class=\"h2\">When to suspect infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We consider the diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis in patients with an endemic exposure and a respiratory illness of more than a week's duration, especially if it appears to involve the lower respiratory tract (ie, community-acquired pneumonia [CAP]). Primary coccidioidal infection should also be suspected in patients with an endemic exposure who present with the new onset of diffuse, symmetrical arthralgias and the rash of either erythema nodosum or erythema multiforme. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H273761226\" class=\"local\">'Signs and symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p>In most cases, the incubation period for onset of symptoms is 7 to 21 days. However, in patients who are immunocompromised due to AIDS, solid organ transplantation, or lymphoma, reactivation can occur after much longer time periods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-coccidioidal-infection/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coccidioidomycosis-in-compromised-hosts\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coccidioidomycosis in compromised hosts&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Because exposure usually occurs within an endemic region, it is critical to obtain an accurate travel history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-coccidioidal-infection/abstract/4,40-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,40-43</a>]. Even brief exposures, such as changing planes in Phoenix, Arizona, have been sufficient to cause infection. A prospective observational study found that 16 of 55 cases (29 percent) of CAP in Tucson, Arizona, were caused by <em>Coccidioides</em> spp [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-coccidioidal-infection/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In another study, 6 of 35 patients (17 percent) with CAP in Phoenix, Arizona, had evidence of acute coccidioidomycosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-coccidioidal-infection/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. A similarly high proportion may be evident in persons who develop CAP within the one- to three-week incubation period after visiting an endemic area. </p><p>Many coccidioidal infections are not identified since the symptoms, signs, and routine laboratory findings are nonspecific, and clinicians do not consider the diagnosis. Low rates of disease recognition have occurred in both nonendemic and endemic areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-coccidioidal-infection/abstract/16,40,45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,40,45,46</a>]. As an example, a cluster of 21 cases of a flu-like illness with rash was noted in a group of patients returning to Washington State after building an orphanage in Mexico [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-coccidioidal-infection/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Although sixteen patients were symptomatic and sought medical attention, the diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis was only confirmed in one case. In a retrospective cohort study, which evaluated data from two medical centers in metropolitan Phoenix, Arizona, the number of patients with CAP tested for Valley Fever was only 2 and 13 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-coccidioidal-infection/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. </p><p>Some practitioners consider the failure to diagnose early coccidioidal infections as an insignificant problem, since many infections resolve without specific therapy. However, identifying coccidioidal infections as early as possible has many benefits; these include: allaying patient anxiety by arriving at a specific diagnosis, often simultaneously dispelling the fear of cancer; reducing the need for additional diagnostic testing, which can involve invasive or costly procedures; eliminating empiric or protracted use of antibacterial treatments; and reducing the morbidity of less frequent but progressively destructive extrapulmonary complications, most of which develop within the first several months following the initial infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-coccidioidal-infection/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-pulmonary-sequelae-and-complications-of-coccidioidomycosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of pulmonary sequelae and complications of coccidioidomycosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1036088807\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach to diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most ambulatory patients who are suspected to have coccidioidomycosis are evaluated with serologic testing. Isolation of <em>Coccidioides</em> species in culture definitively establishes the diagnosis. In addition, direct examination of the smear with potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation or calcofluor white staining is also helpful. A detailed discussion of the laboratory diagnosis is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coccidioidomycosis-laboratory-diagnosis-and-screening#H1033148802\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coccidioidomycosis: Laboratory diagnosis and screening&quot;, section on 'Diagnosing patients with symptomatic disease'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H630889929\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL APPROACH TO TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most immunocompetent patients with primary coccidioidal infection do not require antifungal therapy; however, treatment should be administered to those with severe disease and those at much higher risk for dissemination because of major immunosuppression or pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H1494601102\" class=\"local\">'Patients with or at risk for developing severe disease'</a> below.)</p><p>In addition, all patients with primary coccidioidal infection (regardless of the severity symptoms) should be followed for a year or longer to monitor for the development of complications. (See <a href=\"#H96096634\" class=\"local\">'Patient monitoring'</a> below and <a href=\"#H503559955\" class=\"local\">'Sequelae of primary infection'</a> below.) &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1328015123\"><span class=\"h2\">Mild disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, antifungal therapy is <strong>not</strong> needed for healthy patients without evidence of extensive coccidioidal infection or risk factors for more serious infection, since most patients resolve their infection without treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-coccidioidal-infection/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The management of such patients who develop persistent fatigue is described below. (See <a href=\"#H21453818\" class=\"local\">'Prolonged fatigue'</a> below.)</p><p>Early studies prior to the introduction of antifungal therapy found that most patients with primary coccidioidal infection recover without therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-coccidioidal-infection/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In addition, observational data suggest that antifungal therapy offers little benefit to those with mild disease. As an example, the role of treatment was evaluated in an observational study of 105 patients who were seen at a university-affiliated Veterans Affairs clinic and had primary pulmonary coccidioidomycosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-coccidioidal-infection/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Treatment was initiated based upon severity of illness as assessed by the attending staff; 54 patients were treated and 51 were not. Treatment was more likely to be initiated in patients with elevated symptom scores. There was no difference between the groups with respect to overall rates of improvement. Among the untreated patients, none were subsequently found to have complications.</p><p>However, among 38 of the treated patients, eight had relapse or progression of their coccidioidal infection following discontinuation of therapy; the duration of treatment among these patients ranged from 1 to 24 months. A possible reason for these findings is that patients with more severe illness are more likely to develop relapse. These findings do not provide support for treating patients with mild symptoms of primary coccidioidomycosis, but emphasize the importance of close and prolonged follow-up for patients with severe illness requiring treatment. (See <a href=\"#H96096634\" class=\"local\">'Patient monitoring'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1494601102\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients with or at risk for developing severe disease</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H975259997\"><span class=\"h3\">Whom to treat</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest antifungal therapy for patients with severe disease, and those at increased risk of dissemination or complications. Although there are no randomized trials to determine if antifungal therapy either shortens the course of illness or prevents complications, it is possible that some patients might benefit from treatment.

During the weeks to months following presentation, respiratory symptoms (eg, cough and pleurisy) and systemic signs (eg, weight loss, night sweats, and fever) typically diminish or resolve. Once such improvement has occurred, intervals between clinic visits are usually extended to every three to six months. </p><p>For patients not treated with antifungal drugs, follow-up is usually complete by one year. However, those who receive antifungal therapy should be followed annually for at least two years after the completion of treatment because later recurrences have been noted occasionally in such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-coccidioidal-infection/abstract/10,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,48</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1020580034\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serial serologic testing for complement fixing-type anticoccidioidal antibodies should be repeated at least once several weeks after the initial diagnosis, since a rise in antibody concentrations may be associated with progressive disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-coccidioidal-infection/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Although the original descriptions of this test noted that titers greater than 1:16 were often found in patients with disseminated infection, this correlation is now less reliable due to differences in commercial assays. Serologic studies may also be compromised in patients with altered immunity (transplant patients or HIV-infected patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-coccidioidal-infection/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

The protracted duration of these symptoms resulting from the disease itself is compounded by the resulting deconditioning from reduced physical activity.

By contrast, developing a structured physical rehabilitation program and referral to a physical therapist for reconditioning training is often very helpful.

Most infections are caused by inhalation of spores. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Coccidioides</em> spp are endemic to certain lower deserts of the western hemisphere including southern Arizona, the southern and central valleys of California, southwestern New Mexico, and west Texas in the United States. They are also found in parts of Mexico and Central and South America. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is estimated that less than one-half of all infections come to medical attention because illness is often subclinical. However, when illness is clinically significant, primary infection frequently manifests as community-acquired pneumonia approximately 7 to 21 days after exposure. In addition, some patients can experience constitutional symptoms (eg, fever, drenching night sweats, and weight loss, lasting weeks to months), as well as dermatologic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> rheumatologic manifestations. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We consider the diagnosis of coccidioidomycosis in patients with an endemic exposure and a respiratory illness of more than a week's duration, especially if it appears to involve the lower respiratory tract (ie, community-acquired pneumonia). Primary coccidioidal infection should also be suspected in patients with endemic exposure who present with the new onset of diffuse, symmetrical arthralgias, and the rash of either erythema nodosum or erythema multiforme. (See <a href=\"#H1017503989\" class=\"local\">'When to suspect infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnosis usually relies upon serologic testing. However, isolation of <em>Coccidioides</em> species in culture definitively establishes the diagnosis. Direct examination of the smear with potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation or calcofluor white staining is also helpful. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coccidioidomycosis-laboratory-diagnosis-and-screening\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coccidioidomycosis: Laboratory diagnosis and screening&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Otherwise healthy patients without evidence of extensive coccidioidal infection or risk factors for more serious infection usually do not need antifungal therapy. However, for patients with severe illness, and for those at increased risk of dissemination or complications (eg, immunocompromised hosts or pregnant women), we suggest antifungal therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H975259997\" class=\"local\">'Whom to treat'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When treatment is indicated, we recommend <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluconazole</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">itraconazole</a> for most nonpregnant patients (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). Amphotericin B should be used as initial therapy only in the most severe cases due to its toxicity; it is also used for treatment of pregnant women during the first trimester.
