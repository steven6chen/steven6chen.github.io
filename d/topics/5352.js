To meet this goal, pediatric clinicians must know the normal and abnormal patterns of growth and the changes in body composition that occur during childhood and adolescence, and must understand the risk factors for overweight and malnutrition. In addition, they must be able to accurately perform and interpret the results of the nutritional evaluation.</p><p>Nutritional assessment is the quantitative evaluation of nutritional status.

Iron-fortified infant formulas are acceptable substitutes when mother's milk is not available. Solid foods are added between four and six months of age; most infants in this age group have sufficient neuromuscular development and coordination to swallow pureed foods without complications.

The exclusively breastfed infant typically nurses every two to three hours while awake, or 8 to 12 times per day. After suckling at one breast, the infant should be repositioned at the second breast. The average duration of each nursing is 5 to 20 minutes per breast. &quot;Appetite spurts&quot; or periods of increased feeding frequency may occur at or near 10 days, four weeks, and three months of life. Vitamin D supplementation is recommended for all infants who are exclusively or primarily breastfed, beginning within days of birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-history-and-recommended-dietary-intake-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

However, stooling patterns in healthy breastfed infants varies markedly, ranging from less than one per day to one after each feeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-history-and-recommended-dietary-intake-in-children/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rate of weight gain &mdash; Breastfed infants usually gain 15 to 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> during the first six months, as they grow from an average weight of approximately 3.5 kg at birth to 7.5 kg at 6 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-history-and-recommended-dietary-intake-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. It is normal and appropriate for breastfed infants to gain weight more slowly than formula-fed infants after three months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-history-and-recommended-dietary-intake-in-children/abstract/5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-9</a>]. However, by 12 to 23 months of age, the weights of breast- and formula-fed infants do not differ [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-history-and-recommended-dietary-intake-in-children/abstract/7,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9</a>]. Use of growth charts based on World Health Organization standards provides the most accurate assessment of a breastfed infant's growth. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-growth-patterns-in-infants-and-prepubertal-children#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal growth patterns in infants and prepubertal children&quot;, section on 'Normal patterns'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=measurement-of-growth-in-children#H31542395\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Measurement of growth in children&quot;, section on 'Recommended growth charts'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Formula-fed infants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The assessment of the adequacy of the dietary intake of the formula-fed infant is based upon the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Formula preparation &mdash; Infant formulas are available in three forms: ready-to-feed liquid, concentrated liquid, and powder. Concentrated liquid formula should be mixed with an equal volume of potable water, whereas powdered formulas should be prepared according to directions, usually as one scoop per 2 ounces of water; the water should be measured first and the powder added to it. All three types of formula preparations are nearly identical in nutrient composition, although small differences may exist for technical reasons.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Frequency and volume of feedings &mdash; The frequency with which the formula-fed infant feeds is highly variable because of the variability in gastric emptying time (one to four hours). Ideally, the feeding schedule should be regulated &quot;on demand&quot; by the infant. After the first week of life, most infants will demand six to nine feedings per 24 hours. Some infants will be satisfied with feedings every three to four hours, whereas others will require feedings every two to three hours. Most infants rapidly increase their intake from 30 to 90 mL (one to three ounces) every three to four hours by the end of the first week of life. Most infants require feedings throughout the day and night, although some infants will not awaken for the middle-of-the-night feed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dietary energy intake &mdash; Standard infant formulas contain 0.67 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/mL</span> (20 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/oz)</span> when properly prepared. Therefore, the daily energy intake of the formula-fed infant can be determined from the product of the caloric density of the formula and the volume of formula consumed. Average energy requirements in healthy infants are approximately 110 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/kg/day</span> at one month of age, 95 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/kg/day</span> at three months of age, and 80 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/kg/day</span> between 6 and 12 months of age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F87702\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87702 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-history-and-recommended-dietary-intake-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. This intake results in weight gain of 15 to 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> during the first six months of life, and 6 to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> between 6 and 12 months. Actual energy requirements for an infant vary depending on individual characteristics including medical needs and catch-up growth. Energy requirements for breastfed infants are up to 15 percent less than for formula-fed infants. These estimates are 10 to 20 percent lower than those used in the past [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-history-and-recommended-dietary-intake-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, undernourished infants with acute or chronic illness may require increased energy intakes in the range of 150 to 180 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/kg</span> per day and higher weight gains of 50 to 60 g per day to maintain good nutritional health.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type of formula &mdash; The primary distinction among infant formulas is their protein source, which classifies them into the following categories: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Conventional cow's milk formulas</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Partial whey hydrolysate formulas</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Extensively hydrolyzed whey or casein-based formulas</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Soy protein-based formulas</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Amino acid-based formulas</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">All infant formulas are designed to be nutritionally complete, and have ratios of macronutrients (protein, fat, and carbohydrate) that are similar to breast milk. A few formulas used for infants with specific metabolic disorders may be nutritionally incomplete, but these are highly unusual. The primary indication for use of an extensively hydrolyzed or amino acid-based formula is an infant with established food allergy or protein intolerance, or at high risk of developing allergy. These considerations are discussed in separate topic reviews (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=introducing-formula-to-infants-at-risk-for-allergic-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Introducing formula to infants at risk for allergic disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-protein-induced-proctocolitis-of-infancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Food protein-induced proctocolitis of infancy&quot;</a>). Formulas are sometimes changed empirically for nonspecific symptoms such as reflux or irritability, but a favorable response may or may not be causally related. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Children</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No standard approach exists for estimating the dietary intake in children. Several methods that differ in ease of use and reliability are available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-history-and-recommended-dietary-intake-in-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Once a history has been obtained, food servings should be converted into nutrient content to allow comparison with the Dietary Reference Intakes for specific nutrients. Consultation with a dietitian is helpful in calculating the nutrient content of the child's diet. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs)'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Dietary recall</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The dietary history of the child can be assessed with a 24-hour dietary recall or a food frequency questionnaire. These methods of dietary analysis can be misleading because the child or caregiver must rely on memory to describe typical eating patterns. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>24-hour dietary recall </strong>&ndash; For the 24-hour dietary recall, the child or caregiver is asked to report the type and quantity of food consumed in the preceding 24 hours. This approach provides some quantitative information, but can be misleading because it does not accurately assess foods that are consumed intermittently. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Food frequency questionnaire</strong> &ndash; A food frequency questionnaire is more qualitative, but may provide a better assessment of the intake of episodically consumed foods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-history-and-recommended-dietary-intake-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The questionnaire consists of a finite list of foods, beverages, or supplements with response categories to indicate usual frequency of consumption over a specific time period. The questionnaire also elicits information on usual portion sizes, and in some cases includes portion size images to assist with accuracy. Food frequency data can be used to assess total dietary intake <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> particular aspects of diet. One study that used a food frequency questionnaire found that sixth- and seventh-grade students could provide valid estimates of intake of calories, carbohydrates, calcium, phosphorus, iron and vitamin C, while fourth- and fifth-grade students could not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-history-and-recommended-dietary-intake-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Dietary diary</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The dietary diary is a three-day written food record that lists all foods consumed during a period of two weekdays and one weekend day performed while the child is at home. It is a more valid tool to quantify actual dietary intake compared with the dietary recall methods described above. Parents record the types of food served to the child, the manner in which the food was prepared, the use of additional condiments, and the amount of food consumed using common household measurements. Even in this setting, dietary intake can be doubtful because anxious parents tend to over- or underestimate the child's food consumption depending on the nature of the nutritional problem. Despite these difficulties, every effort should be made to document the possibility that altered dietary intakes contribute to the nutritional problem of the child. Unusual meal patterns such as excessive fruit juice consumption may become apparent from the written document and serve as an explanation for failure to thrive in the young child [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-history-and-recommended-dietary-intake-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Food servings are converted into nutrient content using a computerized nutrient database available from a variety of sources including commercial software packages; a variety of <a href=\"http://fnic.nal.usda.gov/food-composition/international-food-composition-resources&amp;token=lGBsqaTMpLAolGv7c4KBjuhrSqnzso5C/VVQ+pUOdYv4rl3eRJYTKQZeoBTHH9WBxSNShnVGwOuW52mPbn4eV7E+DU8Yg5BKq+QTab4GUHE=&amp;TOPIC_ID=5357\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">International Food Composition Resources</a> are listed on the National Agricultural Library (NAL) website. </p><p>Alternatively, Atwater conversion factors can be used to estimate the energy content of the diet based on the reported intake of each macronutrient.

These were formerly known as United States Recommended Dietary Allowances (USRDAs). The name change was necessary to avoid confusion with the RDA, which is determined by the Institute of Medicine, as described below. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs)'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>The 33 nutrients for which DVs were established reflect the common health problems for the people of the United States, including obesity, hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and osteoporosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F70427\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70427 \">table 1</a>). The reference values are listed on food labels as a percentage of DVs (%DV), based on a 2000 calorie daily energy intake. A 2000 kcal energy intake was used as the reference because it approximates the energy requirement for postmenopausal women, the group of individuals who have the highest risk for excessive dietary energy and fat intakes. It is important to note that these values should be adjusted for individuals whose energy intake is significantly above or below this level, including most children.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>DRIs were developed by the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine to provide quantitative estimates of optimal nutrient intake in a variety of populations. They expand the previously-used RDAs by more carefully identifying optimal nutrient requirements for a population rather than intakes designed to avoid deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-history-and-recommended-dietary-intake-in-children/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Moreover, the DRIs include upper limits (UL) to avoid adverse effects of excessive intake. </p><p>The DRIs are a set of four nutrient-based reference values that can be used to plan and assess the diets of healthy individuals or populations. The components of the DRIs include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Estimated Average Requirement (EAR)</strong> &mdash; The EAR is the daily intake value for individual nutrients that is estimated to meet the requirement in 50 percent of the individuals within a given life stage group.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA)</strong> &mdash; The RDA is the level of dietary intake that is sufficient to meet the daily nutrient requirements of 97 percent of the individuals in a specific life stage group. It is determined by the National Academy of Sciences based on the best available research data. Consumption of nutrients below the RDA does not necessarily constitute a deficiency because absolute nutrient requirements for individuals usually are not known with certainty. However, the further the intake is below the RDA, the more likely that a deficiency will develop. The average intake of most nutrients by children in the United States exceeds 100 percent of the RDA, with the exception of iron, calcium, and zinc [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dietary-history-and-recommended-dietary-intake-in-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Adequate Intake (AI)</strong> &mdash; The AI represents an approximation of the average nutrient intake that sustains a defined nutritional state, based on observed or experimentally determined values in a defined population.

However, undernourished infants with acute or chronic illness may require increased energy intakes in the range of 150 to 180 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/kg</span> per day and higher weight gains of 50 to 60 g per day to maintain good nutritional health.
