The primary symptoms in patients with LQTS include syncope, seizures, and cardiac arrest. LQTS is associated with an increased risk of a characteristic life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia known as torsades de pointes or &quot;twisting of the points&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F53891%7ECARD%2F73827\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef53891 graphicRef73827 \">waveform 2A-B</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-long-qt-syndrome-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>LQTS may be congenital or acquired [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-long-qt-syndrome-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/1,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5</a>]. Mutations in at least 17 genes have been identified thus far in patients with congenital LQTS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F114927\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114927 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-long-qt-syndrome-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, mutations in the three canonical genes, <em>KCNQ1 </em>(LQT1), <em>KCNH2 </em>(LQT2), and <em>SCN5A </em>(LQT3), account for at least 75 percent of all LQTS, with mutations in the minor LQTS-susceptibility genes contributing another 5 to 10 percent. An estimated 15 to 20 percent of patients satisfying a robust clinical diagnosis of LQTS will have a negative LQTS genetic test. Acquired LQTS usually results from undesired QT prolongation and potential for QT-triggered arrhythmias by either QT-prolonging disease states, QT-prolonging medications (<a href=\"http://www.crediblemeds.org/&amp;token=8WmZyxtCPDhnIAxHBR5GfCS/LFztSmi78YK7mOv2rDsc/51VPZuafzJvpcViVbjW&amp;TOPIC_ID=1036\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.crediblemeds.org</a>), or QT-prolonging electrolyte disturbances (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57431\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57431 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-long-qt-syndrome-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Patients without symptoms typically come to medical attention because they have an affected family member, or a prolonged QTc (QT interval corrected for heart rate) is identified on an ECG obtained for some other reason. LQTS-triggered syncopal episodes may be misdiagnosed as a primary seizure disorder, especially in LQT2, with potentially fatal consequences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-long-qt-syndrome-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p>The clinical manifestations of LQTS have been described in several large cohorts, with the following three being the most prominent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-long-qt-syndrome-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The largest cohort of patients with LQTS, from the International Long QT Syndrome Registry, included 3343 individuals (all with QTc &gt;440 milliseconds) from 328 families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-long-qt-syndrome-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

Occasionally, the arrhythmias are transient or self-terminating, resulting in palpitations or presyncope rather than syncope. A screening ECG should be performed in all patients following a first afebrile seizure or unexplained syncope, including episodes consistent with neurocardiogenic (vasovagal) syncope. Those with borderline or prolonged QT intervals should be referred to a cardiologist for further evaluation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-long-qt-syndrome-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital long QT syndrome: Diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with LQTS who present with syncope of uncertain origin (and which is not clearly vasovagal in nature) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an apparent seizure due to an arrhythmia typically have polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (VT). Syncopal episodes associated with ventricular arrhythmias due to LQTS may have tonic-clonic movements and may be misdiagnosed as a primary seizure disorder, often with tragic consequences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-long-qt-syndrome-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/10,12,15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,12,15-17</a>]. Distinguishing between a primary seizure disorder and seizures secondary to LQTS may be challenging, and the entities may overlap. In addition, patients with epilepsy and a recent seizure (within the preceding two years) as well as patients who are taking anti-epileptic medications with sodium channel blocker properties (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a>, etc) appear to have an increased risk of sudden cardiac death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-long-qt-syndrome-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p>As an example of the challenge in establishing the correct diagnosis in patients who present with apparent seizures, one report details eight patients who were treated for a seizure disorder for up to five years until arrhythmia was identified as the underlying cause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-long-qt-syndrome-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Of the five patients who had LQTS, QT prolongation on baseline ECG was significant in only one patient and borderline in two other patients, with the diagnosis being established in four patients by the appearance of exercise-induced polymorphic VT with Holter monitoring. Minor abnormalities detected on electroencephalography may have contributed to the delay of the diagnosis of arrhythmia in four patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H614724905\"><span class=\"h3\">Types of arrhythmias</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of arrhythmias in patients with congenital LQTS are ventricular tachyarrhythmias, although bradycardia, atrioventricular (AV) block, and atrial arrhythmias are present in a small minority of patients.</p><p>The range of arrhythmias that can occur in LQTS was illustrated in the Pediatric Electrophysiology Society registry of 287 children, 61 percent of whom were symptomatic at presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-long-qt-syndrome-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Ventricular arrhythmias were present in 16 percent, with polymorphic VT (also called torsades de pointes) being most common (6 percent at rest and 9 percent during an exercise test), followed by multiform ventricular premature beats (5 percent), uniform ventricular premature beats (4 percent), and monomorphic VT (1 percent). In addition, bradycardia was present in 20 percent and AV block in 5 percent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h4\">Polymorphic VT/torsades de pointes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The classic arrhythmia associated with congenital LQTS is a form of polymorphic VT called torsades de pointes. Torsades de pointes is a common presentation in patients with congenital LQTS, as noted among probands from the International Registry, of whom 80 percent presented with syncope or resuscitated cardiac arrest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-long-qt-syndrome-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Polymorphic VT is defined as a ventricular rhythm faster than 100 beats per minute with frequent variations of the QRS axis, morphology, or both [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-long-qt-syndrome-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/4,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,19</a>]. In the specific case of torsades de pointes, these variations take the form of a progressive, sinusoidal, cyclic alteration of the QRS axis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F53891%7ECARD%2F73827\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef53891 graphicRef73827 \">waveform 2A-B</a>). The peaks of the QRS complexes appear to &quot;twist&quot; around the isoelectric line of the recording, hence the name torsades de pointes or &quot;twisting of the points.&quot;</p><p>Typical features of torsades de pointes include a markedly prolonged QT interval in the last sinus beat preceding the onset of the arrhythmia, a ventricular rate of 160 to 250 beats per minute, irregular RR intervals, and a cycling of the QRS axis through 180 degrees every 5 to 20 beats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-long-qt-syndrome-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/4,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,19</a>]. Notably, macroscopic T wave alternans, when identified, is a marker of high cardiac electrical instability and is considered an important warning for imminent torsades de pointes.</p><p>Torsades de pointes episodes usually are short-lived and terminate spontaneously. However, patients may experience multiple episodes of the arrhythmia, and episodes can recur in rapid succession and may induce syncope or progress to ventricular fibrillation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F115857\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef115857 \">waveform 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-long-qt-syndrome-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/4,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3279971374\"><span class=\"h4\">AV block</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When AV block is present in patients with congenital LQTS, particularly among neonates, there is a significant increase in the likelihood of cardiac arrhythmias and an associated poor prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-long-qt-syndrome-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. While AV block has been noted in 5 percent of patients in the Pediatric Electrophysiology Society cohort, high-grade AV block necessitating permanent pacemaker placement is rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-long-qt-syndrome-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>One mechanism of 2:1 AV block is prolonged ventricular refractoriness, which inhibits alternate depolarizations. True AV conduction abnormalities account for the remaining cases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h4\">Bradycardia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While sinus bradycardia itself is generally not considered an arrhythmia, the presence of bradycardia (a resting heart rate less than 60 beats per minute) is a common finding in patients with LQTS, occurring in 20 percent of patients in the Pediatric Electrophysiology Society registry and in 31 percent of probands from the International Long QT Syndrome Registry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-long-qt-syndrome-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Bradycardia appears to be more common in children during the first three years of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-long-qt-syndrome-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Bradycardia has also been reported in fetuses and neonates with LQTS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-long-qt-syndrome-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. Patients with fetal bradycardia (fetal heart rate &le;110 beats per minute or third percentile or lower for gestational age) may be candidates for more aggressive evaluation for LQTS in the neonatal period. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-long-qt-syndrome-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital long QT syndrome: Diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1227610489\"><span class=\"h4\">Atrial arrhythmias</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Atrial arrhythmias (eg, atrial fibrillation, supraventricular tachycardia, etc) are uncommon in patients with congenital LQTS but appear at a significantly higher frequency than in patients in the general population without LQTS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-long-qt-syndrome-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Triggers of arrhythmia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Arrhythmias in patients with congenital LQTS are triggered frequently by external events (eg, noise, exercise, stress, etc) and are often pause-dependent (the beat triggering the arrhythmia is preceded by an ectopic beat and a subsequent pause). In addition, factors that contribute to the development of acquired LQTS, such as medications known to prolong the QT interval and electrolyte disturbances, can provoke arrhythmias in patients with congenital LQTS that is &quot;mild&quot; or previously unknown to the patient. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-long-qt-syndrome-definitions-causes-and-pathophysiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired long QT syndrome: Definitions, causes, and pathophysiology&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2331476755\"><span class=\"h4\">Pause dependence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The duration of repolarization, which is defined by the duration of the T wave and the QRS interval, varies in relation to the preceding RR interval. At higher heart rates, with shorter RR intervals, repolarization accelerates and the QT interval shortens. The opposite occurs during slower heart rates with longer RR intervals. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-long-qt-syndrome-diagnosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital long QT syndrome: Diagnosis&quot;, section on '12-lead ECG'</a>.)</p><p>Pause dependence refers to the phenomenon in which torsades de pointes is initiated by a &quot;long-short&quot; or &quot;short-long-short&quot; sequence (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F73827\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef73827 \">waveform 2B</a>). This beat-to-beat variation is usually caused by ectopic beats, which can be either ventricular or supraventricular in origin. Following an ectopic beat, there is a slight pause in which the RR interval lengthens for one beat (the &quot;long&quot; RR in the sequence). This pause causes the following QT interval to prolong. If, during this lengthened QT interval, a second ectopic beat occurs early (a &quot;short&quot; RR interval), during the vulnerable period of repolarization (so-called R-on-T phenomenon), torsades de pointes can develop.</p><p>Pause-dependent torsades de pointes is common among patients with LQT2 but rare in patients with LQT1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-long-qt-syndrome-epidemiology-and-clinical-manifestations/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

Many patients have no symptoms, while symptomatic patients can present with syncope, seizures, or cardiac arrest. Patients without symptoms typically come to medical attention because they have an affected family member or a prolonged QTc (QT interval corrected for heart rate) is identified on an ECG obtained for some other reason.

Most times, the arrhythmias are transient or self-terminating and that is why sudden cardiac death is an uncommon sentinel event.

Polymorphic VT is defined as a ventricular rhythm faster than 100 beats per minute with frequent variations of the QRS axis, morphology, or both. In the specific case of torsades de pointes, these variations take the form of a progressive, sinusoidal, cyclic alteration of the QRS axis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F53891%7ECARD%2F73827\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef53891 graphicRef73827 \">waveform 2A-B</a>). The peaks of the QRS complexes appear to &quot;twist&quot; around the isoelectric line of the recording, hence the name torsades de pointes or &quot;twisting of the points.&quot; (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Polymorphic VT/torsades de pointes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arrhythmias in patients with LQTS are frequently triggered by external events (eg, noise, exercise, stress, etc) and are often pause-dependent (the beat triggering the arrhythmia is preceded by an ectopic beat and a subsequent pause). In addition, factors that contribute to the development of acquired LQTS, such as medications known to prolong the QT interval and electrolyte disturbances, can provoke arrhythmias in patients with congenital LQTS that is &quot;mild&quot; or previously unknown to the patient.
