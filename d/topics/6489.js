As a diagnostic category, CVD includes four major areas:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coronary heart disease (CHD) manifested by fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction (MI), angina pectoris, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> heart failure (HF)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cerebrovascular disease manifested by fatal or nonfatal stroke and transient ischemic attack</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peripheral artery disease manifested by intermittent claudication and critical limb ischemia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aortic atherosclerosis and thoracic or abdominal aortic aneurysm</p><p/><p>Although CHD is the most common manifestation of CVD, CHD represents only approximately 50 percent of the total number of first CVD events. The lifetime risk of CHD was illustrated in a study of 7733 participants, ages 40 to 94, in the Framingham Heart Study who were initially free of CHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-disease-risk-assessment-for-primary-prevention-our-approach/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The lifetime risk for individuals at age 40 was 49 percent in men and 32 percent in women. Even those who were apparently free from disease at age 70 had a lifetime risk of 35 and 24 percent in men and women, respectively. The lifetime risk of CHD varies importantly with the aggregate risk factor burden (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F69663\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69663 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-disease-risk-assessment-for-primary-prevention-our-approach/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2087724086\" class=\"local\">'Lifetime risk'</a> below.)</p><p>While a general estimate of the relative risk for CVD can be approximated by counting the number of traditional risk factors present in a patient, a more precise estimation of the absolute risk for a first CVD event is desirable when making treatment recommendations for a specific individual. This topic will review which patients should undergo CVD risk assessment, the approach to assessing risk, and the implications of the estimate risk on preventive therapies. The various CVD risk models are presented separately, as are discussions of the specific approach to the primary prevention treatment of various risk factors.

Formal estimates of CVD risk with this approach have generally been based on the experience of asymptomatic middle-aged adults 40 years of age or older.

A number of multivariate risk models have been developed for estimating the risk of initial CVD events in apparently healthy, asymptomatic individuals based upon assessment of multiple variables. The choice of a specific risk model for CVD risk assessment should be individualized based on patient-specific characteristics (eg, age, gender, ethnicity). Most experts feel that the use of risk models that predict hard CVD events (ie, death, myocardial infarction [MI], stroke) are preferred over those that include other endpoints (ie, revascularization).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3138063404\"><span class=\"h3\">Choosing a risk calculator</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Issues involved in selecting a risk calculator include the applicability of the data to the particular population or ethnic group being modeled, risk factors which have been assessed, and outcomes being predicted.

Generally, clinicians should use risk calculators that have been evaluated and preferably validated for their locale and for the specific race and ethnic groups. The focus here is on American and European CVD risk estimation, but other calculators have been developed and put to use around the world.

Earlier Framingham calculators from 1998 did not include stroke as a predicted outcome, although the effects of statins on stroke reduction are similar to the effects on other major CV outcomes. The 2008 Framingham calculators do include stroke, but also include outcomes such as heart failure, which is not proven to be reduced by statin therapy, and development of claudication, which may be of less importance to patients than the outcomes of coronary heart disease (CHD) death, MI, and stroke.</p><p>The 2013 American College of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/American</span> Heart Association <span class=\"nowrap\">(ACC/AHA)</span> Pooled Cohort Equations CV Risk Calculator (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-cardiovascular-risk-assessment-in-adults-10-year-acc-aha-2013\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 3</a>) uses data primarily on non-Hispanic whites and African Americans in the United States. Unlike prior United States calculators, it predicts important CV events that are reduced by statin therapy. A potential limitation of the <span class=\"nowrap\">ACC/AHA</span> calculator is that family history of premature CVD is not included in the model. This may underestimate risk in patients with very strong family histories of CV events. Additionally, the <span class=\"nowrap\">ACC/AHA</span> includes DM only as a <span class=\"nowrap\">yes/no</span> question. Issues that may affect risk with DM include patient age, sex, duration of DM, and whether the patient has type 1 or type 2 DM.

Informal calculation of lifetime risk of CVD for persons &lt;40 years of age may be used to help guide therapy. The 10-year risk of CVD is typically low, especially in younger patients, while the 30-year or lifetime risk can be moderately high. Using lifetime risk estimates in persons &lt;40 years involves extrapolations, and age 40 years is typically imputed. Such estimates can be used to help guide the care for the individual. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiovascular-disease-risk-assessment-for-primary-prevention-risk-calculators\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiovascular disease risk assessment for primary prevention: Risk calculators&quot;</a>.)</p><p>One potential problem with using lifetime risk calculations in making decisions about primary preventive therapies is the lack of long-term data on the effects of statin therapy. We have very limited evidence regarding either comparative benefits or harms with longer-term compared with shorter-term statin therapy, and there is substantial evidence that statin therapy can produce marked improvements in outcomes soon after it is initiated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol-ldl-c-in-secondary-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3781201579\"><span class=\"h2\">Special populations</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2074620477\"><span class=\"h3\">Patients under 40 years of age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no firm data for atherosclerotic CVD risk in persons less than 40 years of age, although generally the incidence is low in this population. However, persons with a positive history for CVD in a first degree relative (sibling or parent), those with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), or those who have had imaging studies done (such as CAC scoring) yielding abnormalities may present for advice. Expert opinion and observational database reports have generally provided the data for such persons.</p><p>In discussions with younger patients, particularly those with risk factors that are not usually well accounted for using standard risk calculators (ie, FH, family history of CVD, etc), our approach is to emphasize discussion of a patient&rsquo;s &quot;lifetime risk&quot; (or &quot;30-year risk&quot; in some risk estimators) rather than simply the 10-year risk, as the 10-year risk will almost universally be calculated as low or very low due to age alone. Utilizing the 2013 <span class=\"nowrap\">ACC/AHA</span> CV risk calculator (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-cardiovascular-risk-assessment-in-adults-10-year-acc-aha-2013\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 3</a>) and simply rounding the person's age upward (imputing an age of 40 years)&nbsp;may also be done to provide a rough estimate of 10- and 30-year risks, and that approach may not provide accurate estimates.</p><p>For specific subsets of younger patients, our approach is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Patients with heterozygous FH</strong> &ndash; We do not use 10-year or lifetime risk estimates&nbsp;in patients with FH, as&nbsp;that approach may seriously underestimate&nbsp;CVD risk. For primary prevention, these patients are typically treated with maximally tolerated statin doses, and other LDL-C lowering agents are also often included depending on the LDL-C level. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=familial-hypercholesterolemia-in-adults-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Familial hypercholesterolemia in adults: Treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Patients with type 1 DM</strong> &ndash; We do not use risk estimators in young patients with type 1 DM, as there are no firm data to guide atherosclerotic CVD risk assessment in this population.

Additionally, clinicians should also mention risks for microvascular disease (retinopathy, kidney&nbsp;disease with albuminuria,&nbsp;or adverse changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]) that are common in these patients.

A general precept in patients of all ages, which also applies to patients &gt;79 years of age, is to continue the CVD preventive strategies that are in place and not to discontinue them, especially if they are well-tolerated. Another principle for the care of patients is to consider the patient&rsquo;s overall prognosis and not simply focus on prevention of CVD, especially in persons with limited life expectancy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H621112814\"><span class=\"h1\">HOW OFTEN SHOULD CVD RISK BE REASSESSED?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As with any clinical scenario, an individual patient&rsquo;s CVD risk is not static but can vary significantly over time. A person&rsquo;s CVD risk can be positively or negatively influenced depending on the development or treatment of concurrent medical conditions as well as lifestyle choices. As such, risk factors and an estimation of CVD risk should be regularly reassessed over time.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients at low CVD risk and with no change in clinical status, we reassess CVD risk every four to six years. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients at intermediate or greater CVD risk, we typically reassess CVD risk more frequently than every four to six years, but the primary focus should be on risk factor modification. Patients with CVD risk factors are typically treated, and the health care provider should endeavor to optimize the CVD risk factors with lifestyle and pharmacologic interventions. Periodic reassessment of CVD risk is of some interest, but the focus should be on the preventive care of the patient with control of risk factors. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H479118547\"><span class=\"h1\">IMPLICATIONS OF ESTIMATED CVD RISK</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following the estimation of an individual&rsquo;s CVD risk, there can be implications for the patient (ie, need for lifestyle changes <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> preventive medications) as well as for family members (ie, need for CVD risk screening).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3305255463\"><span class=\"h2\">Who needs primary prevention therapy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We recommend statin therapy to most patients with a 10-year risk of 7.5 to 10 percent or greater. This range is consistent with many guideline recommendations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiovascular-disease-risk-assessment-for-primary-prevention-our-approach/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. We also suggest low-dose daily <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> (75 to 100 mg) for individuals age &ge;50 years without excess bleeding risk. Extensive discussions of the role of aspirin and statins in the primary prevention of CVD are presented separately.

If the clinician believes the patient is at increased CVD risk, <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> should be encouraged to discuss the implications with first degree family members, who may then choose to discuss CVD risk with their own primary care providers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H835346851\"><span class=\"h2\">Can primary prevention therapy be discontinued?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A general precept in nearly all patients is to continue the primary prevention strategies that are in place and not to discontinue them, especially if they are well-tolerated. As with any therapy, however, it is prudent to periodically reassess the risks and benefits, along with an assessment of the patient&rsquo;s quality of life and overall prognosis.

While a general estimate of the relative risk for CVD can be approximated by counting the number of traditional risk factors present in a patient, a more precise estimation of the absolute risk for a first CVD event is desirable when making treatment recommendations for a specific individual. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients aged 40 to 79 years without established CVD or diabetes should undergo periodic CVD risk assessment every four to six years (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F114544\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef114544 \">algorithm 1</a>). It is unknown at what age periodic risk assessment should no longer be performed, but many of the validated risk models have only included patients up to 79 years of age. Individuals of any age with established CVD or CVD risk equivalents (eg, diabetes) no longer require the same type of risk assessment as patients without known CVD. Such patients are known to be at high risk of recurrent CV events and should be treated with appropriate secondary prevention measures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease-events-in-those-with-established-disease-or-at-high-risk\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of cardiovascular disease events in those with established disease or at high risk&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Who should undergo estimation of CVD risk?'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For all individuals, the first step in assessing CVD risk is to determine whether one or more of the traditional risk factors (hypertension, cigarette smoking, diabetes mellitus, premature family history of CVD, chronic kidney disease, obesity) for CVD is present. Subsequently, for individuals &ge;20 years of age, a baseline lipid profile is generally obtained. Once all of the relevant risk factors have been identified and data acquired (ie, blood pressure and lipid profile), all patients from 40 to 79 years of age should have CVD risk estimated using a validated CVD risk calculator. (See <a href=\"#H2683778763\" class=\"local\">'Identify risk factors'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3180922874\" class=\"local\">'Estimate CVD risk using a risk calculator'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiovascular-disease-risk-assessment-for-primary-prevention-risk-calculators\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiovascular disease risk assessment for primary prevention: Risk calculators&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many individuals with a low calculated 10-year CVD risk will still have a high lifetime risk, as the strongest determinant of risk in most risk calculators is age. For patients with low or very low 10-year risk, particularly those &le;59 years of age, we calculate 30-year (or lifetime) CVD risk. (See <a href=\"#H2087724086\" class=\"local\">'Lifetime risk'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3710896457\" class=\"local\">'10-year risk versus 30-year (lifetime) risk'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients at low CVD risk and with no change in clinical status, we reassess CVD risk every four to six years.
