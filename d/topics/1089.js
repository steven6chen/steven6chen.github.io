Due to a marked increase in resistant isolates, the United States Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that adamantanes <strong>not</strong> be used in the United States for the treatment of influenza, except in selected circumstances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiviral-drug-resistance-among-seasonal-influenza-viruses/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p/><p>Although instances of antiviral drug resistance among influenza viruses have occurred during antiviral therapy, resistant influenza strains have also spread widely in the absence of such drug pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiviral-drug-resistance-among-seasonal-influenza-viruses/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Adamantane-resistant H3N2 influenza A viruses have circulated globally since 2003, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oseltamivir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oseltamivir</a>-resistant seasonal H1N1 influenza A viruses between 2007 and 2009, and adamantane-resistant pandemic H1N1 influenza A viruses since 2009 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiviral-drug-resistance-among-seasonal-influenza-viruses/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

The use of antiviral agents for the treatment and prevention of influenza in children and adults as well as the pharmacology of antiviral drugs for influenza are discussed separately.

Neuraminidase inhibitors interfere with the release of progeny influenza virus from infected cells, thereby preventing new rounds of infection. In comparison with adamantane resistance, resistance to the neuraminidase inhibitors appears to arise less readily, both in vitro and in vivo.</p><p>Two mechanisms of resistance have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiviral-drug-resistance-among-seasonal-influenza-viruses/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mutations that result in amino acid substitutions in the conserved active site of the neuraminidase (either part of catalytic residues or so-called framework amino acids surrounding the active site), which usually result in drug-specific resistance. Cross-resistance may also occur with these mutations, which generally leads to reductions in infectivity and virulence in animal models. The most common neuraminidase mutation occurring in H1N1 viruses is the H275Y mutation described below. (See <a href=\"#H14769427\" class=\"local\">'H275Y mutation'</a> below and <a href=\"#H14768948\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mutations in the hemagglutinin at or near the site that binds to sialic acid residues, reducing the efficiency of viral binding, which leads to diminished dependence of the viral replication cycle on neuraminidase.

The H275Y mutation reduces susceptibility of H1N1 influenza virus to oseltamivir by more than 400-fold and also reduces susceptibility to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peramivir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">peramivir</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiviral-drug-resistance-among-seasonal-influenza-viruses/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>] but does <strong>not</strong> cause resistance to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zanamivir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zanamivir</a> in vitro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiviral-drug-resistance-among-seasonal-influenza-viruses/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>].</p><p>Some in vitro and animal models have suggested that neuraminidase inhibitor&ndash;resistant influenza viruses prior to 2006 may have been less fit than wild-type viruses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiviral-drug-resistance-among-seasonal-influenza-viruses/abstract/10,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,14,15</a>]. However, subsequent in vitro data show that the replication capacity of viral isolates from 2007 were unimpaired compared with earlier isolates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiviral-drug-resistance-among-seasonal-influenza-viruses/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. A nosocomial cluster of infection with an H1N1 influenza A virus harboring the H275Y mutation suggested that the mutated virus was transmissible and retained pathogenicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiviral-drug-resistance-among-seasonal-influenza-viruses/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], possibly due to the presence of permissive or compensatory mutations, increasing the cell surface expression of the neuraminidase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiviral-drug-resistance-among-seasonal-influenza-viruses/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Since the 2009 pandemic, the H1N1 virus of swine origin has generally retained <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oseltamivir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oseltamivir</a> susceptibility with approximately 1 percent of viruses exhibiting resistance, most frequently in immunocompromised patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiviral-drug-resistance-among-seasonal-influenza-viruses/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>The active metabolite of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oseltamivir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oseltamivir</a>, oseltamivir carboxylate, has been detected in aquatic environments since it is poorly degraded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiviral-drug-resistance-among-seasonal-influenza-viruses/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In a study in which mallard ducks were infected with H1N1 influenza A virus and were then exposed to oseltamivir through their sole water source, the H275Y mutation dominated the influenza strains detected in fecal samples from ducks exposed to 80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> of oseltamivir.</p><p>The epidemiology of influenza viruses possessing the H275Y mutation is presented below.

Mutants with deletion of a few amino acids in the neuraminidase that exhibit resistance to oseltamivir have been reported in patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiviral-drug-resistance-among-seasonal-influenza-viruses/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14768948\"><span class=\"h3\">Epidemiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to 2007, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oseltamivir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oseltamivir</a> resistance was rare in ambulatory care settings and emerged during treatment in 1 to 5 percent of cases in clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiviral-drug-resistance-among-seasonal-influenza-viruses/abstract/7,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,25,26</a>]. However, during the 2007 to 2008 influenza season, oseltamivir-resistant isolates emerged in Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiviral-drug-resistance-among-seasonal-influenza-viruses/abstract/7,27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,27-29</a>]. None of the patients included in the initial reports of oseltamivir-resistant influenza had been taking oseltamivir, suggesting that resistant virus can be transmitted between individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiviral-drug-resistance-among-seasonal-influenza-viruses/abstract/11,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,27</a>]. During the 2008 to 2009 influenza season, high rates of oseltamivir resistance (&gt;90 percent) were observed in the United States, Australia, and the Philippines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiviral-drug-resistance-among-seasonal-influenza-viruses/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. With the onset of the 2009 H1N1 influenza A pandemic, the predominantly oseltamivir-susceptible pandemic strain replaced the oseltamivir-resistant seasonal H1N1 strain worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiviral-drug-resistance-among-seasonal-influenza-viruses/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>A small minority of isolates of pandemic H1N1 influenza A virus with resistance to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oseltamivir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oseltamivir</a> were detected from patients in several countries, including Japan, the United States, China, Hong Kong, Singapore, Vietnam, Denmark, and Australia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiviral-drug-resistance-among-seasonal-influenza-viruses/abstract/19,33-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,33-46</a>]. Among 37 cases in the United States, 76 percent occurred in severely immunocompromised patients and 89 percent occurred in patients who had received oseltamivir; thus, both features appear to be risk factors for the development of oseltamivir resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiviral-drug-resistance-among-seasonal-influenza-viruses/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. However, in a community cluster of oseltamivir-resistant pandemic H1N1 influenza A infection in Vietnam, none of the individuals had received oseltamivir prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiviral-drug-resistance-among-seasonal-influenza-viruses/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Sustained community transmission of oseltamivir-resistant pandemic H1N1 influenza A was also identified in 29 individuals in New South Wales, Australia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiviral-drug-resistance-among-seasonal-influenza-viruses/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. Hemagglutinin and neuraminidase sequence analysis indicated that the resistant strains were closely related, suggesting the spread of a single variant. Only one patient had received oseltamivir prior to collection of a respiratory specimen for resistance testing. The neuraminidase mutation H275Y, which caused widespread oseltamivir resistance among seasonal H1N1 influenza A isolates beginning in 2007, was also detected in isolates from patients with oseltamivir-resistant pandemic H1N1 influenza A infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiviral-drug-resistance-among-seasonal-influenza-viruses/abstract/33,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,39</a>]. Furthermore, community clusters of oseltamivir resistance in untreated individuals may be explained by the presence of permissive neuraminidase mutations that restore the viral fitness of H275Y [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiviral-drug-resistance-among-seasonal-influenza-viruses/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H528700\"><span class=\"h4\">Immunocompromised patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Resistance mutations of influenza viruses to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oseltamivir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oseltamivir</a> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zanamivir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zanamivir</a> appear to emerge more commonly in immunocompromised patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiviral-drug-resistance-among-seasonal-influenza-viruses/abstract/23,24,48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24,48,49</a>].
