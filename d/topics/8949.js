All of these treatments need to be tempered based on individual factors, such as age, life expectancy, and comorbidities. Although several studies have noted remissions of type 2 diabetes mellitus that may last several years, most patients require continuous treatment in order to maintain normal or near-normal glycemia. Treatments to achieve normoglycemia focus on increasing insulin availability (either through direct insulin administration or through agents that promote insulin secretion), improving sensitivity to insulin, delaying the delivery and absorption of carbohydrate from the gastrointestinal tract, or increasing urinary glucose excretion.</p><p>Methods used to control blood glucose in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes are reviewed here. Further management of persistent hyperglycemia and other therapeutic issues, such as the frequency of monitoring and evaluation for microvascular and macrovascular complications, are discussed separately.

Every 1 percent drop in glycated hemoglobin (A1C) is associated with improved outcomes with no threshold effect.

However, target A1C goals in patients with type 2 diabetes should be tailored to the individual, balancing the improvement in microvascular complications with the risk of hypoglycemia. Glycemic targets are generally set somewhat higher for older adult patients and those with comorbidities or a limited life expectancy and little likelihood of benefit from intensive therapy. Glycemic goals are discussed in more detail separately.

In clinical trials comparing diabetes education with usual care, there was a small but statistically significant reduction in A1C in patients receiving the diabetes education intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. There was no difference in quality of life. In two meta-analyses, use of mobile phone interventions for diabetes education was successful in significantly reducing A1C (-0.5 percentage points) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p>Medical nutrition therapy (MNT) is the process by which the dietary plan is tailored for people with diabetes, based on medical, lifestyle, and personal factors. It is an integral component of diabetes management and diabetes self-management education. For patients with type 2 diabetes who are overweight (body mass index [BMI] &ge;25 to 29.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>)</span> and obese (BMI &ge;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>),</span> major emphasis should be placed on lowering caloric intake and increasing physical activity to achieve weight loss. Improved glycemic control induced by weight loss is associated with partial correction of the two major metabolic abnormalities in type 2 diabetes: insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. For patients who are not overweight, the goal of MNT is weight management, consistency in day-to-day carbohydrate intake at meals and snacks, and overall nutritional content. MNT is reviewed in detail elsewhere.

The improvement in glycemic control is related both to the degree of caloric restriction and weight reduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Modest weight reduction may also improve liver function in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, which is associated with insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes.

However, this benefit will persist only if negative calorie balance and weight reduction are continued.</p><p>Despite the clear benefit of weight loss, only a small percentage of patients with type 2 diabetes are able to attain and maintain substantial weight loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/9,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11,12</a>]. Several studies have evaluated the long-term efficacy of diet (alone or with exercise) in patients with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutritional-considerations-in-type-2-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutritional considerations in type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>). In the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study (UKPDS), for example, all patients were given a low-calorie, low-fat, high complex carbohydrate diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

Furthermore, the mean glucose value was substantially higher with diet alone than with diet plus an oral hypoglycemic drug or insulin.</p><p>The likelihood of a successful glycemic response to diet is determined in large part by the initial fasting blood glucose. In the UKPDS, the degree of weight loss required to normalize the fasting blood glucose was 10 kg (16 percent of initial body weight) if the initial value was 108 to 144 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (6 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> versus 22 kg (35 percent) if the initial value was 216 to 252 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (12 to 14 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F78027\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78027 \">figure 2</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1667087\"><span class=\"h3\">Pharmacologic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pharmacotherapy for weight loss may be effective in patients with type 2 diabetes, but it is generally associated with high dropout rates due to medication side effects and is not recommended as primary therapy for diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

In the absence of contraindications (eg, moderate to severe proliferative retinopathy, severe coronary artery disease), people with type 2 diabetes should also be encouraged to perform resistance training (exercise with free weights or weight machines) at least twice per week. Regular exercise is beneficial in type 2 diabetes, independent of weight loss. It leads to improved glycemic control due to increased responsiveness to insulin; it can also delay the progression of impaired glucose tolerance to overt diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. These beneficial effects are directly due to exercise, but concurrent weight reduction can play a contributory role (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=effects-of-exercise-in-adults-with-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Effects of exercise in adults with diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>). In one study, however, only 50 percent of patients with type 2 diabetes were able to maintain a regular exercise regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6062398\"><span class=\"h2\">Intensive lifestyle modification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with established type 2 diabetes, intensive behavioral modification interventions focusing on weight reduction and increasing activity levels are successful in reducing weight and improving glycemic control while, at the same time, reducing the need for glucose-lowering and other medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-blood-glucose-in-adults-with-type-2-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/3,18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,18-20</a>].

The intensive intervention included caloric restriction (maximum 30 percent calories from fat, minimum 15 percent protein, and the remainder from carbohydrates, in the form of liquid meal replacements, frozen food entrees, or structured meal plans), moderate-intensity physical activity (goal 175 minutes weekly), and weekly group or individual sessions with registered dietitians, behavioral psychologists, and exercise specialists. If weight loss goals were not achieved in the first six months, a weight loss medication (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=orlistat-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">orlistat</a>) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> advanced behavioral strategies were initiated.</p><p>The primary outcome was a composite of death from cardiovascular causes, nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, and hospitalization for angina.

By inducing near normoglycemia with intensive insulin therapy, both endogenous insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity improve; this results in better glycemic control, which can then be maintained with diet, exercise, and oral hypoglycemics for many months thereafter. Insulin may cause weight gain and hypoglycemia.
