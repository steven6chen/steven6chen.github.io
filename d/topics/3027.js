As a result: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Serum electrolytes usually are normal, because the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis remains intact. However, patients with central forms of adrenal insufficiency are at risk for isolated and clinically significant <strong>dilutional</strong> hyponatremia because of loss of the facilitatory role of cortisol on free water excretion. In the latter situation, the patient is not hypovolemic and the serum potassium level is not elevated. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Adrenal crisis (hypotension leading to shock) is less common than in primary adrenal insufficiency, but can occur due to glucocorticoid deficiency alone. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperpigmentation is not present because ACTH secretion is not increased. By contrast, patients with primary adrenal insufficiency may have hyperpigmentation because of overproduction of proopiomelanocortin (ACTH precursor) and its cleavage products including melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH), which results in increased melanin synthesis. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypoglycemia may be severe and is often the presenting symptom, especially in children with adrenal insufficiency resulting from isolated ACTH deficiency, or in combination with growth hormone deficiency. Acute presentations of hypoglycemia can be severe, leading to seizure and coma. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There may be associated neonatal cholestasis due to giant cell hepatitis. The mechanism is unclear, but appears to be more common in infants with multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies, especially growth hormone and cortisol. </p><p/><p>Inherited disorders of adrenal responsiveness to ACTH (familial glucocorticoid deficiency and Triple A syndrome) are a form of primary adrenal insufficiency. However, mineralocorticoid secretion is typically normal, similar to disorders of central adrenal insufficiency.

There also are case reports of anorexic patients who have a blunted ACTH response to stress that may lead to episodes of adrenal insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-clinical-manifestations-of-central-adrenal-insufficiency-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

This is principally the result of cessation of long-term, high-dose exogenous glucocorticoid therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Cessation of glucocorticoid therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Exogenous glucocorticoid therapy suppresses the normal function and feedback mechanism of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Withdrawal of glucocorticoids may cause symptoms of adrenal insufficiency because of an inadequate response by the suppressed hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. This is especially evident during periods of stress (eg, surgery, major trauma, or infection). One well-characterized example of this adrenal suppression has been observed in patients with childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia after cessation of glucocorticoid therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-clinical-manifestations-of-central-adrenal-insufficiency-in-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p>The following are general guidelines to consider regarding the withdrawal of exogenous glucocorticoid and its effect on the function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the administered dose of glucocorticoid is less than the amount needed for physiologic maintenance therapy, then there is no major adrenocortical suppression. There is no need to wean the glucocorticoid dose and no need for exogenous glucocorticoid therapy for stressful events.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the administered dose was greater than physiologic maintenance therapy and the duration of replacement therapy was less than four weeks, there is expected to be prompt recovery of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis after glucocorticoid withdrawal. As a result, there is no need to wean the glucocorticoid dose and no need for exogenous glucocorticoid therapy for stressful events.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the administered dose was greater than physiologic maintenance therapy and the duration of replacement therapy was greater than four weeks, the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis may be suppressed. Recovery of adrenal function occurs within six weeks in about half of the patients and within six months for almost all patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-clinical-manifestations-of-central-adrenal-insufficiency-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. During this time period, exogenous glucocorticoid therapy may be needed for stressful events.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is principally associated with oral or parenteral glucocorticoid therapy, suppression can occasionally occur after the cessation of topical glucocorticoid therapy, contained in nasal sprays [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-clinical-manifestations-of-central-adrenal-insufficiency-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], eye drops [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-clinical-manifestations-of-central-adrenal-insufficiency-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], inhaled products [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-clinical-manifestations-of-central-adrenal-insufficiency-in-children/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>], or dermal creams or lotions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-clinical-manifestations-of-central-adrenal-insufficiency-in-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Maternal glucocorticoid therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neonates born to mothers treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">hydrocortisone</a> usually have normal adrenal cortisol secretion, because only a small portion of maternal cortisol crosses the placenta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-clinical-manifestations-of-central-adrenal-insufficiency-in-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. As a result, there is normally no suppression of the infant's hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. </p><p>However, high dose maternal glucocorticoid therapy that is prolonged may result in significant placental passage of synthetic glucocorticoids, which could suppress the fetal hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis; this is especially true for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">dexamethasone</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-clinical-manifestations-of-central-adrenal-insufficiency-in-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].

A few infants with more severe or prolonged hypoglycemia, or those who are not candidates for oral supplementation, may need intravenous glucose infusion or a brief period of glucocorticoid replacement.

However, they are responsible for 10 to 20 percent of cases of Cushing's syndrome in older children and adolescents. In these patients, high cortisol production is autonomous (independent of ACTH), resulting in suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.

(See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Isolated ACTH deficiency'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Hypopituitarism'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most common cause of central adrenal insufficiency is cessation of high dose glucocorticoid therapy. This therapy suppresses the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. The adrenal insufficiency becomes clinically apparent if the glucocorticoid therapy is stopped abruptly (rather than tapered), as there has not been an opportunity for the HPA axis to recover. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Cessation of glucocorticoid therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-and-clinical-manifestations-of-central-adrenal-insufficiency-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">de Moraes DC, Vaisman M, Concei&ccedil;&atilde;o FL, Ortiga-Carvalho TM.
