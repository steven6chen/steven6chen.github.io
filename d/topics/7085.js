The condition is characterized by the progressive loss of terminal hairs over the frontal and vertex regions of the scalp, resulting in a visible reduction in hair density (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F87193%7EDERM%2F87194%7EDERM%2F87195\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87193 graphicRef87194 graphicRef87195 \">picture 1A-C</a>). Unlike many cases of androgenetic alopecia in men (male pattern hair loss), the loss of terminal hairs in affected areas is usually incomplete and the frontal hairline is often spared. &#160;</p><p>The pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of FPHL will be reviewed here. Other forms of nonscarring hair loss and the treatment of FPHL are discussed separately.

The term &quot;andro&quot; signified a hormonal etiology and &quot;genetic&quot; signified a contribution of heredity to the clinical phenotype. </p><p>Over the years, as more work on hair loss was published, &quot;female pattern hair loss&quot; became the preferred term for this form of hair loss in women. This newer terminology helps to distinguish the different clinical features of this process in women versus men and reflects the lack of evidence to support a hormonal contribution in all cases of the condition. </p><p>Further, some authors use the terms &quot;androgen-dependent FPHL&quot; and &quot;androgen-independent FPHL&quot; to separate women with FPHL due to androgen excess from women with FPHL and normal androgen levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-pattern-hair-loss-androgenetic-alopecia-in-women-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The term &quot;female pattern alopecia&quot; has also been used in place of FPHL.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H109567516\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>FPHL is a common condition. In a series of approximately 1000 Caucasian women in the United States, the prevalence of FPHL was 19 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-pattern-hair-loss-androgenetic-alopecia-in-women-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The prevalence of FPHL appears to be lower in the Asian population than among Caucasians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-pattern-hair-loss-androgenetic-alopecia-in-women-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Little is known about the prevalence in women of African descent. </p><p>Although FPHL can occur at any time in life beginning in puberty, the condition most commonly occurs following menopause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-pattern-hair-loss-androgenetic-alopecia-in-women-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. The age-related rise in FPHL was clearly demonstrated in the American series mentioned above; FPHL was detected in only 4 of 121 women between the ages of 20 and 29 (3 percent), but in 41 of 140 women between ages 70 and 89 (29 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-pattern-hair-loss-androgenetic-alopecia-in-women-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In a British study of 377 women who presented to a general dermatology clinic with concerns unrelated to hair loss, 38 percent of women over the age of 70 years had FPHL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-pattern-hair-loss-androgenetic-alopecia-in-women-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H109567523\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY AND PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The visible thinning of hair over the frontal scalp and vertex of the scalp in FPHL results from a progressive decrease in the ratio of terminal hairs to shorter, thinner vellus hairs in the affected areas, a process known as follicular miniaturization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-pattern-hair-loss-androgenetic-alopecia-in-women-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. As part of this process, the duration of the anagen (growth) phase of hair follicles shortens from a normal duration of a few years to only weeks to months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-pattern-hair-loss-androgenetic-alopecia-in-women-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

Although the crucial roles of androgens and genetic susceptibility in male androgenetic alopecia are well-accepted, the degree to which these factors contribute to FPHL in most women is less clear. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=androgenetic-alopecia-in-men-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H21714534\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Androgenetic alopecia in men: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H432607103\"><span class=\"h2\">Androgens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Male androgenetic alopecia occurs as a consequence of the effects of dihydrotestosterone (a potent metabolite of testosterone) on susceptible hair follicles. Dihydrotestosterone binds to androgen receptors in hair follicles, resulting in the upregulation of genes responsible for the gradual transformation of terminal hair follicles to miniaturized hair follicles. The pattern of the hair loss, which typically spares the occipital scalp, reflects regional differences in the sensitivity of scalp follicles to androgens (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F83805\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83805 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-pattern-hair-loss-androgenetic-alopecia-in-women-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

This concept is supported by the observation that women with disorders of hyperandrogenism (eg, polycystic ovarian syndrome, ovarian hyperthecosis, or adrenal or ovarian androgen-secreting tumors) may develop early-onset FPHL as a feature of these diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-pattern-hair-loss-androgenetic-alopecia-in-women-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. However, androgen levels are normal in most women with FPHL, indicating that our understanding of the pathogenesis of this disorder remains incomplete [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-pattern-hair-loss-androgenetic-alopecia-in-women-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. In a series of 109 women with moderate to severe FPHL, laboratory evidence for hyperandrogenism was present in only 39 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-pattern-hair-loss-androgenetic-alopecia-in-women-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. &#160;</p><p>Proposed theories on the mechanisms through which women with normal androgen levels could develop FPHL include increased sensitivity of hair follicles to androgens and an influence of estrogens on the development of this condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-pattern-hair-loss-androgenetic-alopecia-in-women-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,12</a>]. The age-related increase in FPHL, with the highest rates in postmenopausal women, suggests the possibility of a role for estrogen. However, studies have demonstrated conflicting evidence on whether estrogens stimulate or inhibit hair growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-pattern-hair-loss-androgenetic-alopecia-in-women-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H432607110\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While it is known that genetic susceptibility influences the development of male androgenetic alopecia, relatively little is known regarding the genetic basis and inheritance pattern of female pattern hair loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-pattern-hair-loss-androgenetic-alopecia-in-women-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. An Australian gene-wide association study of Caucasian women suggested that the aromatase gene (<em>CYP19A1</em>) may contribute to FPHL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-pattern-hair-loss-androgenetic-alopecia-in-women-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, no definitive familial inheritance has been identified. Multiple genes may contribute to susceptibility to FPHL.

The frontal scalp and vertex of the scalp are the primary sites of involvement. Although diffuse involvement occasionally occurs, the occipital scalp is usually relatively spared. </p><p>The exact pattern of hair loss varies among women. In some patients, the frontal scalp thinning is most prominent, resulting in the visualization of a &quot;Christmas-tree&quot; like pattern when the hair is parted at the midline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-pattern-hair-loss-androgenetic-alopecia-in-women-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>], whereas in others, diffuse central thinning is the most pronounced feature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-pattern-hair-loss-androgenetic-alopecia-in-women-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The frontal hairline is usually relatively spared, though women frequently exhibit mild bitemporal thinning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-pattern-hair-loss-androgenetic-alopecia-in-women-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/9,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,17,18</a>]. A combined pattern that resembles male androgenetic alopecia (frontotemporal recession and vertex loss) is infrequently seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-pattern-hair-loss-androgenetic-alopecia-in-women-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Scarring, inflammation, and scale are not clinical features of FPHL. If these features are seen in a patient with hair loss, another scalp disorder may be present in conjunction with FPHL or may be solely responsible for the clinical findings. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-hair-loss\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and diagnosis of hair loss&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A variety of methods have been used to classify the clinical features of FPHL. The Ludwig scale is one of the most commonly used grading scales (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F87190\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87190 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-pattern-hair-loss-androgenetic-alopecia-in-women-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Other scales that have been used to describe the severity of FPHL include the Sinclair (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F87210\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87210 \">picture 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-pattern-hair-loss-androgenetic-alopecia-in-women-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] and Savin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-pattern-hair-loss-androgenetic-alopecia-in-women-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>] scales. </p><p>The FPHL Severity Index, a three-component severity scale, has been proposed as a method to facilitate earlier recognition of FPHL and to assess disease severity over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-pattern-hair-loss-androgenetic-alopecia-in-women-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The FPHL Severity Index involves assessment of hair shedding, midline hair density, and trichoscopic findings. This scale has not been validated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H605925860\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSOCIATED DISORDERS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H352182082\"><span class=\"h2\">Psychosocial dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many women with FPHL experience negative psychosocial effects related to the condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-pattern-hair-loss-androgenetic-alopecia-in-women-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. As an example, in a questionnaire-based study that included 96 women with FPHL and 56 female control subjects, 70 percent of the affected women reported that they were very upset to extremely upset about their hair loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-pattern-hair-loss-androgenetic-alopecia-in-women-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Women with hair loss experienced more feelings of negative body image, poorer self-esteem, less of a sense of control over their lives, and had a less satisfying quality of life than the control group. A separate study in which 58 women were interviewed about the effects of FPHL on their quality of life also found that hair loss frequently was accompanied by negative psychosocial effects. In this study, 88 percent of women felt that the hair loss negatively influenced daily life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-pattern-hair-loss-androgenetic-alopecia-in-women-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p>Adolescent girls with FPHL may also experience psychosocial dysfunction. Girls with FPHL may suffer from poor self-esteem and impaired functioning at home, school, or work and in interpersonal relationships [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-pattern-hair-loss-androgenetic-alopecia-in-women-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>When managing patients with FPHL, clinicians should remain cognizant that the clinical assessment of the severity of FPHL may not be consistent with the patient&rsquo;s perception of the severity of hair loss and the psychosocial impact of the condition. In a questionnaire-based study of 104 women with FPHL, telogen effluvium, or alopecia areata, the patient perception of the severity of hair loss tended to be greater than the perception of the examining dermatologist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-pattern-hair-loss-androgenetic-alopecia-in-women-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In addition, the patients&rsquo; severity ratings correlated more closely with the effects of hair loss on patient quality of life than the severity ratings given by the dermatologist.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H432607899\"><span class=\"h2\">Associated medical conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Certain medical disorders may be associated with FPHL. In addition to causes of hyperandrogenism (eg, ovarian or adrenal tumors, polycystic ovarian syndrome, adrenal hyperplasia), links between FPHL and insulin resistance, hypertension, and increased risk for death from diabetes or heart disease have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-pattern-hair-loss-androgenetic-alopecia-in-women-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/25-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-27</a>]. Further study is necessary to clarify whether the associations between FPHL and these conditions are valid. Of note, cardiovascular risk factors have been associated with androgenetic alopecia in men. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=androgenetic-alopecia-in-men-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H21714612\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Androgenetic alopecia in men: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Cardiovascular disease'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H109567572\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of female pattern hair loss is usually made clinically. Scalp biopsies are helpful aids for diagnosis when concomitant disorders of the scalp confound the clinical findings or the diagnosis is unclear. Laboratory tests to assess for hyperandrogenism are performed when clinical findings suggestive of hyperandrogenism are present.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H605925949\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient history can provide clues to support or negate a diagnosis of FPHL and to identify an underlying hyperandrogenic state. We typically inquire about the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age of onset, duration, and rate of progression of hair loss</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence of signs of virilization (hirsutism, deepening of voice, clitoral enlargement)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gynecologic and obstetrical history (menstrual irregularities, difficulty conceiving)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence of other medical disorders, significant changes in health status, medication list</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of hormonal or nutritional supplements that may contain androgens</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Family history of male and female hair loss</p><p/><p>A rapid onset of diffuse hair loss may suggest acute telogen effluvium, particularly when the history suggests a change in health status (eg, serious illness, pregnancy, significant weight loss) or medication changes within the preceding several months. Of note, telogen effluvium may coexist with FPHL, and an episode of telogen effluvium may unmask underlying FPHL. The gynecologic history and assessment for signs of virilization help to identify women for whom an evaluation for hyperandrogenism is indicated. (See <a href=\"#H432606918\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Women with FPHL may first notice their hair loss as the progressive thinning of a ponytail or as increasing visibility of the scalp through the hair in the frontal and vertex areas of the scalp. These features are typically noted over the course of months to years. Although the onset and progression of FPHL is often insidious, occasional patients describe noticing specific episodes of increased hair loss prior to a noticeable change in terminal hair density. Women may also complain of an increased propensity for sunburns on the scalp as hair coverage diminishes. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H605925941\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A full skin examination that includes evaluation of the scalp, face, body, and nails is advised in patients who present with a new complaint of hair loss. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-hair-loss#H638362\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and diagnosis of hair loss&quot;, section on 'Physical examination'</a>.)</p><p>The examination of the scalp and scalp hair should focus on identifying the distribution of hair loss and the caliber of hairs within the involved areas. Findings consistent with FPHL include the detection of terminal hair loss that is primarily localized to the frontal scalp <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vertex of the scalp and miniaturized hairs (shorter and thinner hairs or vellus hairs). The use of a sheet of paper as a contrasting background can facilitate visualization of individual hairs.</p><p>Comparing the part width in the frontal or vertex scalp with the occipital scalp, which is usually relatively spared, provides a visual aid for the assessment of the reduction in hair density. Even in patients who develop diffuse hair loss from FPHL, hair thinning usually remains most prominent in the frontal and vertex areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-pattern-hair-loss-androgenetic-alopecia-in-women-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/9,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,28</a>].</p><p>The examination of the scalp should also focus on the detection of clinical features such as inflammation, scarring, or scale. The presence of these features strongly suggests that the hair loss is caused by a different disease or that FPHL coexists with another scalp disorder. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-hair-loss\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and diagnosis of hair loss&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The examination of other body sites may result in the identification of features useful for diagnosis and patient management. For example, patients with diffuse alopecia areata may have nail abnormalities and patchy hair loss on other body sites, findings that are not associated with FPHL. In addition, the presence of hirsutism, acne, and obesity suggest the possibility of a hyperandrogenic state related to polycystic ovarian syndrome or another hormonal abnormality. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alopecia-areata#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of alopecia areata&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-polycystic-ovary-syndrome-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of polycystic ovary syndrome in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Hair pull tests, which can identify increased shedding of telogen hairs, may be positive in early hair loss on the central scalp, but are typically negative in patients with long-standing FPHL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-pattern-hair-loss-androgenetic-alopecia-in-women-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

Testing for hyperandrogenism is performed in women with FPHL when the clinical features suggestive of hyperandrogenism are present (eg, hirsutism, irregular menses, moderate to severe acne, treatment-refractory adult acne, acanthosis nigricans, or galactorrhea). We typically obtain a free <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> total testosterone level and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) level as initial screening tests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-pattern-hair-loss-androgenetic-alopecia-in-women-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Oral contraceptives should be discontinued for at least two months prior to androgen testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-pattern-hair-loss-androgenetic-alopecia-in-women-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Additional tests for specific disorders of hyperandrogenism are added as indicated.

A trichogram is a technique in which 25 to 50 hairs are grasped with a needle holder and plucked from the scalp followed by an examination of the proximal ends of the hair to assess for the proportion of hairs in telogen. Trichograms are now seldom used in the diagnosis of FPHL. The results of one retrospective study suggest that dermoscopy (trichoscopy) is more useful for the diagnosis of FPHL than trichograms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-pattern-hair-loss-androgenetic-alopecia-in-women-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H605926128\" class=\"local\">'Dermoscopy'</a> above.)</p><p>Phototrichograms are imaging techniques used to closely examine the features of hair loss for diagnosis and follow-up. A small area of hair is trimmed and followed with imaging for the proportion of regrowing (anagen) hairs, resting (telogen) hairs, and shed hairs, as well as the rate of growth, and hair density [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-pattern-hair-loss-androgenetic-alopecia-in-women-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Computerized techniques for performing phototrichograms have been developed (TrichoScan and Folliscope) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-pattern-hair-loss-androgenetic-alopecia-in-women-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/38-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-42</a>]. Phototrichograms are primarily utilized in clinical studies and specialized hair clinics. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-hair-loss#H93848306\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and diagnosis of hair loss&quot;, section on 'Trichograms and phototrichograms'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H432606918\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple hair and scalp disorders may present with clinical features that resemble FPHL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-pattern-hair-loss-androgenetic-alopecia-in-women-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Careful review of the patient history, physical examination findings, and biopsy (when necessary) is of value for differentiating these disorders from FPHL. Of note, since FPHL is a common condition, the coexistence of FPHL with other disorders must also be considered when patients present with features that are not entirely consistent with FPHL.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Telogen effluvium </strong>&ndash; Telogen effluvium is the disorder that may be most difficult to distinguish from FPHL. Patients present with acute or chronic noninflammatory, diffuse hair loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-pattern-hair-loss-androgenetic-alopecia-in-women-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. The clinical history is often of value for identifying this diagnosis. For example, a major illness, severe psychological trauma, significant weight loss, childbirth, and certain medications may precipitate an episode of acute telogen effluvium that begins a few months after the insult. In telogen effluvium, hair loss occurs in all areas of the scalp, although the hair loss may be most evident in the temporal area (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F76636\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76636 \">picture 4</a>). A hair pull test often demonstrates increased shedding of telogen hairs in patients with active telogen effluvium. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Diffuse alopecia areata </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>The rare diffuse form of alopecia areata is characterized by diffuse reduction in hair density (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F87197\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87197 \">picture 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-pattern-hair-loss-androgenetic-alopecia-in-women-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Due to the preferential loss of pigmented hairs, adult patients may complain of rapid graying of the hair. Though not always present, a personal or family history of alopecia areata, the detection of circumscribed areas of complete hair loss, and nail abnormalities offer support to this diagnosis. A biopsy is useful for confirming the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-alopecia-areata#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of alopecia areata&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia is a scarring alopecia that most commonly occurs in women of African descent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-pattern-hair-loss-androgenetic-alopecia-in-women-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. The classic location on the vertex of the scalp contributes to the potential for confusion of this diagnosis with FPHL (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F87198\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87198 \">picture 6</a>). The detection of loss of follicular ostia indicates the presence of scarring. Pustules or inflammation may be detected in early disease. Biopsies are used to confirm the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=central-centrifugal-cicatricial-alopecia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Frontal fibrosing alopecia </strong>&ndash; Frontal fibrosing alopecia is an uncommon scarring alopecia that is usually characterized by frontotemporal recession, perifollicular erythema and follicular hyperkeratosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-pattern-hair-loss-androgenetic-alopecia-in-women-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Eyebrow loss may also occur. The detection of clinical and histologic signs consistent with a lymphocytic scarring alopecia aid in diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lichen-planopilaris#H692730\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lichen planopilaris&quot;, section on 'Frontal fibrosing alopecia'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Traction alopecia </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Traction alopecia is a form of hair loss that occurs as a result of chronic tension on the hair shaft and follicle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F60331\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60331 \">picture 7</a>). Tight braiding of the hair is a common cause of this condition. Hair loss due to traction alopecia is often located at the hairline. Although the hair loss is reversible initially, hair loss may become permanent if tension on the hair follicles continues. The patient history is useful for diagnosis.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H452176536\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Female pattern hair loss (FPHL) is a common, nonscarring form of hair loss that most commonly occurs in adult women. The highest prevalence of FPHL is found in postmenopausal women. (See <a href=\"#H109567516\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although hormonal factors and genetic predisposition are believed to contribute to FPHL, the mechanism through which these factors lead to FPHL is not entirely clear. The majority of women with FPHL do not have abnormal levels of serum androgens. (See <a href=\"#H109567523\" class=\"local\">'Etiology and pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Classically, FPHL presents with a slow, progressive transition of terminal hairs on the frontal scalp <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vertex of the scalp to shorter, thinner hairs and vellus hairs. The process results in a visible reduction in hair coverage on the scalp (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F87193%7EDERM%2F87194%7EDERM%2F87195\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87193 graphicRef87194 graphicRef87195 \">picture 1A-C</a>). The occipital scalp and frontal hairline are often relatively spared. (See <a href=\"#H109567558\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although FPHL does not cause physical discomfort or physical disability, the hair loss can contribute to significant psychological distress. (See <a href=\"#H352182082\" class=\"local\">'Psychosocial dysfunction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of FPHL is usually made clinically, based upon the patient history and physical examination. The diagnosis is suggested by the detection of a reduction in hair density in the characteristic distribution and an increased prevalence of miniaturized hairs. Skin biopsies are not usually performed, but can be helpful when the diagnosis is uncertain or when a concomitant scalp disorder is suspected. (See <a href=\"#H109567572\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of FPHL includes several types of nonscarring and scarring hair loss. Telogen effluvium, central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia, and traction alopecia are examples of relatively common disorders that share features with FPHL.
