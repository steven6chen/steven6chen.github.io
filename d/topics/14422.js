AML is characterized by a clonal proliferation of myeloid precursors with reduced capacity to differentiate into more mature cellular elements.</p><p>The response to treatment and overall survival of patients with AML is heterogeneous. A number of prognostic factors related to patient and tumor characteristics have been described for AML, including age, performance status, and karyotype (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F60295\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60295 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>This topic will review prognostic factors in AML. Adverse risk factors that are more common in older adults (eg, patients over age 60 years) with AML are discussed separately.

The strongest adverse clinical predictors are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Advanced age</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Poor performance status</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cytogenetic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> molecular genetic findings in tumor cells</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of prior exposure to cytotoxic agents or radiation therapy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of prior myelodysplasia or other hematologic disorders such as myeloproliferative neoplasms</p><p/><p>The first two factors are the main predictors of early death, while the others are better predictors of resistant disease or early relapse. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=therapy-related-myeloid-neoplasms-acute-myeloid-leukemia-and-myelodysplastic-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Therapy-related myeloid neoplasms: Acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Karyotype'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While there is no clearly accepted definition of younger compared to older adults when dealing with AML, in most studies, &quot;older adults&quot; was defined as greater than ages 55, 60, or 65 years. Such older adults have lower rates of achieving a complete remission and shorter disease-free survival when compared with younger patients. </p><p>Higher age appears to act as an adverse prognostic marker even in younger patients. A population-based retrospective study from the United Kingdom that included 11,303 patients with AML diagnosed from 2001 to 2006 reported an estimated five-year overall survival rate of 15 percent, which varied according to the age at diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>15 to 24 years (289 patients) &ndash; 53 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>25 to 39 years (702 patients) &ndash; 49 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>40 to 59 years (2170 patients) &ndash; 33 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>60 to 69 years (2208 patients) &ndash; 13 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>70 to 79 years (3258 patients) &ndash; 3 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&gt;80 years (2676 patients) &ndash; 0 percent</p><p/><p>A retrospective analysis of 891 patients &lt;30 years old found that five-year event-free survival (EFS) rates decreased as patient age at diagnosis increased with rates of 54, 46, and 28 percent for children (2 to &lt;13 years), adolescents (13 to &lt;21 years), and young adults (21 to &lt;30 years), respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. With favorable karyotypes excluded, outcomes were superior in children (EFS 44 percent) compared with adolescents (35 percent) and young adults (23 percent).</p><p>The effect of age on outcome in patients with AML is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pretreatment-evaluation-and-prognosis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia-in-older-adults#H6273162\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pretreatment evaluation and prognosis of acute myeloid leukemia in older adults&quot;, section on 'Prognosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Performance status</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most other clinical risk factors in AML are related to comorbidities (eg, heart failure, renal insufficiency, concurrent infection) that can be partially reflected by the patient's performance status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/3,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6</a>]. The two most commonly used tools are the Karnofsky performance status and the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F58785%7EHEME%2F72901\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58785 graphicRef72901 \">table 2A-B</a>). Performance status and age at diagnosis can be combined to estimate the percentage of patients who will die within the first 28 days of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This ranges from 5 percent for patients under the age of 50 years with an ECOG performance status &lt;3 to 57 percent for patients over age 69 with an ECOG performance status of &ge;3 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F69209\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69209 \">table 3</a>). Performance status appears to be of greatest prognostic value in older adults and may not predict early outcomes (mortality, intensive care unit admission, complete remission) in younger patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pretreatment-evaluation-and-prognosis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia-in-older-adults#H15843351\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pretreatment evaluation and prognosis of acute myeloid leukemia in older adults&quot;, section on 'Physical functioning'</a>.)</p><p>As an example, a retrospective analysis of 968 adults with newly diagnosed AML treated by the Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG) enrolled in prospective trials of induction therapy reported increasing 30-day mortality rate with worsening performance status and increased age at diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Patients &le;65 years of age had 30-day mortality rates of 5, 4, 9, and 21 percent if they presented with an ECOG performance status of 0, 1, 2, or 3, respectively. Patients &gt;65 years had rates of 13, 16, 35, and 60 percent, respectively. Older patients with a worse performance status were also less likely to obtain a complete remission. However, subsequent studies have reported lower rates of short term mortality in older patients, probably due to improvements in supportive care. As an example, a large randomized trial in patients &gt;60 years of age reported a 30-day mortality of approximately 11 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>It should be emphasized that these and other published estimates of outcomes derive from results of patients entered on clinical trials. These trials usually exclude individuals with organ dysfunction and substantially impaired performance status and hence these results may not directly apply to the large fraction of older patients with medical and sometimes psychosocial comorbidities. Indeed, data indicate that the majority of older patients do not receive induction chemotherapy as a consequence of either their refusal of treatment or physician assessment that they would not tolerate or benefit from treatment. Assessment of performance status in AML can be tricky. For example, a patient may have no or minimal symptoms with a PS of 0 or 1 and develop fever and infection and instantly become a PS 3 or 4, depending on the severity of the infection. With proper treatment, they can rapidly revert to baseline. Therefore, many factors may have to be considered when using PS to predict prognosis, and it may be that medical co-morbidity indices that also include more chronic medical conditions will be more helpful in the future. A number of such scoring systems, some originally designed for transplant recipients, have been developed, but none have been validated for use in individual patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Therapy-related AML</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Persons who are exposed to cytotoxic agents or radiation therapy are at risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and myelodysplastic <span class=\"nowrap\">syndrome/myeloproliferative</span> neoplasms. These conditions lie along a continuum of disease and are categorized by the 2016 WHO classification system as therapy-related myeloid neoplasms (t-MN) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. T-MNs account for approximately 10 to 20 percent of all cases of AML, MDS, and <span class=\"nowrap\">MDS/MPN</span>. The incidence among patients treated with cytotoxic agents varies according to the underlying disease, specific agents, timing of exposure, and dose. The prognosis of patients with t-MN is generally worse than for those with de novo AML because of higher rates of drug resistance. This is discussed in more detail separately.

These disorders are often associated with ineffective hematopoiesis and dysfunctional blood cells. By the time that AML emerges, these patients may be colonized by pathogenic flora, threatened by recurrent bleeding episodes, and dependent upon transfusions.</p><p>In one study that compared gene mutations in patients with secondary AML (after a prior myeloid malignancy), therapy-related AML, and unspecified AML, the identification of a gene mutation in one of eight genes (<em>SRSF2, SF3B1, U2AF1, ZRSR2, ASXL1, EZH2, BCOR, </em>or<em> STAG2</em>) was highly specific for a diagnosis of secondary AML and a poor clinical outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Other factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The effect of race on patient outcomes in AML is uncertain. Using data from seven CALGB studies, it was found that African American and white subjects with AML differ significantly with respect to important risk factors such as cytogenetic risk groups and age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. African American men had significantly lower rates of complete remission (54 versus 64 percent) and five-year overall survival (16 versus 24 percent) than white men, and may represent a higher risk group. Further studies of this type are needed to confirm these results, suggest possible biologic mechanisms, and provide appropriate high risk treatment programs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25245151\"><span class=\"h1\">CYTOGENETIC AND MOLECULAR FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Specific cytogenetic and molecular features permit stratification of AML into various prognostic groups.

The approximately 10 percent of patients with AML who demonstrate a monosomal karyotype have a low rate of complete remission after induction (48 percent) and a &lt;5 percent rate of overall survival at four years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. The additional prognostic value of including &quot;monosomal karyotype&quot; in the adverse risk group was specifically addressed in the analysis of 5876 patients on MRC trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. While patients with a monosomal karyotype had particularly poor outcomes (&lt;5 percent overall survival at 10 years), 94 percent of cases with a monosomal karyotype were already classified as adverse risk according to the criteria defined above. In at least one retrospective study, the prognostic values of the monosomal karyotype and complex karyotype did not remain when patients with 17p abnormalities or chromosome 5 abnormalities were removed from the analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].<br/><br/>In two large retrospective analyses, patients with a monosomal karyotype had lower rates of complete remission (CR) and overall survival when compared with patients with unfavorable cytogenetics without a monosomal karyotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. The overall outcome for patients with a monosomal karyotype appeared to be better following allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) when compared with consolidation with chemotherapy alone. The benefit of allogeneic HCT in this population was further supported by an analysis of 305 patients with newly diagnosed AML with a monosomal karyotype enrolled in three consecutive <span class=\"nowrap\">HOVON/SAKK</span> phase III trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. CR was achieved in 140 (46 percent) and 107 proceeded with consolidation chemotherapy (48 patients), high dose chemotherapy with autologous stem cell rescue (14 patients), or allogeneic HCT (45 patients). The rates of overall and relapse-free survival at five years were 13 and 12 percent, respectively. The five-year overall survival rates were higher with allogeneic HCT when compared with chemotherapy or autologous stem cell rescue (19 versus 9 percent). None of the 33 patients who achieved a CR but did not proceed to consolidation survived.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with abnormalities of chromosome band 11q23, seen in 5 to 10 percent of patients with de novo AML and in some patients with therapy related leukemia after having received topoisomerase II inhibitors, have had a poor outcome when treated with conventional chemotherapy and have previously been included in the adverse risk group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/37-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-40</a>].

Median survival was lower in trisomy 8 patients over the age of 60 than in younger patients (4.8 versus 17.5 months) with no long-term survivors among the older patients. The only long-term survivors were those less than 60 years of age who were treated with autologous or allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation while in first complete remission. A later CALGB study indicated a five-year overall survival of 7 to 9 percent for the group of patients &gt;60 years of age with trisomy 8 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another CALGB study in patients &ge;60 years of age with AML, the presence of a complex karyotype consisting of three or more chromosome abnormalities in at least one clone or a rare aberration (in the absence of t(8;21) and inv(16)), was associated with five-year disease-free and overall survival rates of 2 percent or less following standard cytotoxic chemotherapy used in conventional doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

Mutations in the FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 gene producing internal tandem duplications (<em>FLT3</em>-ITD) and constitutive activation of the FLT3 receptor tyrosine kinase are quite common in AML, particularly in patients with normal karyotypes, and have been associated with poorer survival in children and in younger and older adults receiving intensive chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/56,82,94-105\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,82,94-105</a>].

The most common are internal tandem duplications (ITD) of different length that result in ligand-independent activation of the FLT3 receptor and a proliferative signal. Alternatively, point mutations in the activating loop of the kinase domain of <em>FLT3</em> may result in tyrosine kinase activation of FLT3 in 5 to 10 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/109,110\" class=\"abstract_t\">109,110</a>].</p><p>Two representative studies of patients with <em>FLT3</em>-ITD have estimated two-year progression-free survival rates of 20 percent and four-year overall survival of approximately 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/56,101\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,101</a>]; absence of a wild type <em>FLT3</em> allele (ie, homozygous or hemizygous <em>FLT3-</em>ITD) appears to confer an especially poor prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-of-acute-myeloid-leukemia/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>].

Among patients with <em>FLT3</em>-ITD mutations, expression of CD25 was associated with shorter median survival (10 versus 25 months) and a lower rate of survival at three years (4 versus 42 percent). &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

A number of prognostic factors related to patient and tumor characteristics have been described for AML (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F60295\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60295 \">table 1</a>). Of these, patient age at diagnosis, performance status, and karyotype have the most direct effect on treatment at this time and should be a part of the initial evaluation of all patients with newly diagnosed AML.
