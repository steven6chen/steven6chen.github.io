A &quot;concussion&quot; is another word for a mild brain injury.</p><p>Common causes of mild brain injuries include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Car accidents</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Falling down and other accidents that can happen from daily activities</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Injuries from playing sports such as football, ice hockey, soccer, and boxing</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Injuries that can happen to soldiers during combat. These include injuries from blasts and bullet wounds.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13955544\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of postconcussion syndrome?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dizziness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling very tired</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling irritable or anxious</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Memory problems or problems paying attention</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Problems with sleep</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Being easily bothered by noise</p><p/><p>Some of these symptoms can be stressful or scary. It might help to keep in mind that they are real problems caused by your concussion, and they will get better with time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13955559\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. Your doctor or nurse should be able to tell if you have postconcussion syndrome by learning about your symptoms and doing an exam.</p><p>But depending on your symptoms, you might have tests to make sure you do not have a different problem. For example, some people have an imaging test called an MRI that creates pictures of the brain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13955574\"><span class=\"h1\">How is postconcussion syndrome treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatments are different depending on which symptoms you have. There are medicines that can help with headaches, dizziness, and other problems.</p><p>After a concussion, your doctor will tell you when you can play sports or do your usual activities again. It will depend on your injury and symptoms, as well as the type of sport you play. Depending on your symptoms, you might not be able to go back to work full time right away.</p><p>If you have postconcussion syndrome, your symptoms will probably start to go away after about a week. Most people start to feel better in a week or 2, and are back to normal in 3 months. But a few people have symptoms that last longer. In these cases, your doctor might suggest medicines or other treatments.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13955589\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=concussion-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Concussion in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=head-injury-in-children-and-adolescents-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Head injury in children and adolescents (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=headaches-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Headaches in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=vertigo-a-type-of-dizziness-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Vertigo (a type of dizziness) (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
