For example, obesity-related insulin resistance and abnormalities in inflammatory pathways can affect placental growth and function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-pregnancy-complications-and-maternal-management/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], and have been linked to development of preeclampsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-pregnancy-complications-and-maternal-management/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].

In a 2010 systematic review of maternal overweight and obesity and risk of preterm birth, overweight and obese women were at increased risk of induced preterm birth compared with women of normal BMI (relative risk [RR] 1.30, 95% CI 1.23-1.37, five studies) and the risk increased with increasing weight [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-pregnancy-complications-and-maternal-management/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>Whether obesity increases the risk for spontaneous preterm birth is less clear. The 2010 systematic review found no difference in the rate of spontaneous preterm birth between groups; however, heterogeneity was high. A subsequent population-based cohort study from Sweden including over 1.5 million singleton deliveries confirmed that overweight and obese women were at increased risk of medically indicated preterm deliveries at all gestational ages, but also observed a significant dose-response relationship between severity of obesity and risk of spontaneous extremely preterm delivery (22 to 27 weeks), but not for very preterm (28 to 31 weeks) or moderately preterm (32 to 36 weeks) delivery after adjustment of confounders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-pregnancy-complications-and-maternal-management/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. The authors hypothesized that the obesity-related inflammatory up-regulation, as well as other factors (eg, subclinical genital tract infection), increased the risk of spontaneous extremely preterm delivery.</p><p>Several studies have also demonstrated an independent association between PCOS and spontaneous preterm birth, including cervical insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-pregnancy-complications-and-maternal-management/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. The precise mechanism by which PCOS modulates the risk for spontaneous preterm birth or cervical insufficiency, independent from or as part of the obesity effects, has not been well defined but may be related to changes in the hormonal milieu (eg, increased relaxin levels) that weaken the cervical collagen matrix.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Post-term pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The body of evidence supports an association between obesity and post-term pregnancy (OR 1.2 to 1.7 in four population-based studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-pregnancy-complications-and-maternal-management/abstract/28,30,49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,30,49,50</a>]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-pregnancy-complications-and-maternal-management/abstract/28,30,49-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,30,49-53</a>].</p><p>The mechanism by which obesity prolongs pregnancy has not been determined.

While these observations are consistent among studies, authors have not consistently adjusted for diabetes status in their analyses or excluded women with diabetes.

For example, congenital anomalies are more difficult to detect with prenatal ultrasonography in obese women, resulting in fewer optimal examinations and antepartum diagnoses and, in turn, fewer pregnancy terminations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-pregnancy-complications-and-maternal-management/abstract/94-102\" class=\"abstract_t\">94-102</a>]. Maternal obesity reduces the detection of fetal anomalies by at least 20 percent compared with women with a normal BMI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-pregnancy-complications-and-maternal-management/abstract/98,101,103\" class=\"abstract_t\">98,101,103</a>].

A population-based cohort study from Sweden reported increased risks of perinatal asphyxia-related complications (Apgar 0 to 3 at five minutes, meconium aspiration, neonatal seizures) with increasing maternal BMI in singleton term infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-pregnancy-complications-and-maternal-management/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>]. A 2014 systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies found that even modest increases in maternal BMI increased the risk of fetal death, stillbirth, and infant death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-pregnancy-complications-and-maternal-management/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>]. The 44 publications included &gt;10,000 fetal deaths, &gt;16,000 stillbirths, &gt;4000 perinatal deaths, &gt;11,000 neonatal deaths, and almost 5000 infant deaths.

Obese women have higher rates of diabetes and hypertension than nonobese women; however, a proportion of the excess risk of death remains after adjustment for these factors. Other potential etiologies include metabolic changes associated with obesity (hyperlipidemia with reduced prostacyclin production) and nocturnal apnea with transient oxygen desaturation. It is also possible that confounding factors, such as maternal age, smoking, and infants with congenital anomalies, account for the disparity. Antepartum, external fetal heart rate monitoring my not provide a clear tracing in severely obese women; intrapartum, clinicians may delay performance of emergency cesarean delivery in such women. Although most studies attempted to adjust for confounders, adjustment factors varied among the studies. </p><p>Another concerning observation is the increased risk for stillbirth with increasing degrees of maternal obesity. Previous work has demonstrated that the risk for stillbirth increases with increasing obesity (stillbirth adjusted hazard ratio [95% CI]: class I obesity 1.3 [1.2-1.4], class II obesity 1.4 [1.3-1.6], class III obesity 1.9 [1.3-1.6]) and higher stillbirth risk in African American obese women (1.9 [1.7-2.1]) than in Caucasian obese women (1.4 [1.3-1.5]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/obesity-in-pregnancy-complications-and-maternal-management/abstract/8,106\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,106</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H21757198\" class=\"local\">'Definition of obesity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adipose tissue is an active endocrine organ; when present in excess, it can have dysregulatory effects on metabolic, vascular, and inflammatory pathways in many organ systems, and thereby lead to a variety of reproductive and medical problems. (See <a href=\"#H3449956393\" class=\"local\">'Pathobiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Compared with pregnant women with BMI &lt;25 <span class=\"nowrap\">kg/m<sup>2</sup>,</span> pregnancies among obese women are at increased risk of several adverse outcomes, including increased rates of early pregnancy loss, congenital anomalies, stillbirth, pregnancy-associated hypertension, preterm and post-term birth, gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), multifetal gestation, and birth of a large for gestational age infant. Macrosomia may result in shoulder dystocia and its sequelae (brachial plexus injury) or cesarean delivery. Cesarean delivery in obese women is associated with increased rates of wound infection and thromboembolism.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Obese pregnant women are also at increased risk for maternal disorders, such as sleep-related breathing disorders, carpal tunnel syndrome, postpartum depression, and venous thromboembolism (VTE). (See <a href=\"#H716551402\" class=\"local\">'Potential issues in pregnancy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ideally, health care providers and obese women should discuss reproductive planning well before conception, including (see <a href=\"#H1609002772\" class=\"local\">'Prepregnancy management'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Information about the adverse effects of obesity on fertility.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Information about the potential pregnancy complications associated with obesity, as described above.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Evaluation for obesity-associated medical comorbidities (eg, diabetes, hypertension) and appropriate intervention to optimize maternal health status.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Counseling about the benefits of weight loss before attempting to conceive. Significant preconception weight loss likely reduces the risks of pregnancy complications. Some obese women could benefit from referral for bariatric surgery. (See <a href=\"#H2722169680\" class=\"local\">'Prepregnancy weight loss'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Given the associations between obesity and adverse pregnancy outcome, modifications to routine prenatal care have been suggested for this population. (See <a href=\"#H88168352\" class=\"local\">'Pregnancy management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Some of these modifications include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Screening for diabetes in early pregnancy. (See <a href=\"#H33392449\" class=\"local\">'Baseline assessments'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Limiting gestational weight gain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F75820\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75820 \">table 4</a>) (see <a href=\"#H4192465295\" class=\"local\">'Gestational weight gain'</a> above). Encouraging regular exercise can help control gestational weight gain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-during-pregnancy-and-the-postpartum-period\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exercise during pregnancy and the postpartum period&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Routine ultrasound examination to establish an accurate gestational age and for fetal anatomic survey.

Obese women are not at increased risk for fetal aneuploidy; however, obesity can affect screening test performance. Cell-free fetal DNA screening is more likely to result in test failure or an inaccurate result in obese women because they have a lower fetal fraction of the cell-free DNA. (See <a href=\"#H1462073721\" class=\"local\">'Fetal aneuploidy screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Referral to a sleep medicine specialist in selected women based on BMI and other comorbidities <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> symptomatology (eg, snoring, witnessed apneas, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> falling asleep while driving).

(See <a href=\"#H3394915386\" class=\"local\">'Anesthesia consultation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although stillbirth risks are increased in the setting of maternal obesity, there is no evidence demonstrating improved pregnancy outcome with routine use of antenatal fetal surveillance with nonstress tests or biophysical profile scoring; thus, a recommendation for or against use of antenatal testing cannot be made at this time. Testing should be initiated for standard indications. (See <a href=\"#H664293095\" class=\"local\">'Assessment of fetal well-being'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delivery timing and indications for labor induction should not be altered solely based on maternal obesity; however, induction by the estimated date of delivery is reasonable and does not appear to increase cesarean delivery rates.
