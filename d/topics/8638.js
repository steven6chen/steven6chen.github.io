Recurrent alveolar bleeding may eventually produce pulmonary hemosiderosis and fibrosis. Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage is characterized by hemoptysis, dyspnea, alveolar opacities on chest radiographs, and anemia and can result from a variety of underlying conditions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F52374\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52374 \">table 1</a>). When no underlying cause for repeated episodes of diffuse alveolar hemorrhage is apparent, the entity is referred to as idiopathic pulmonary hemosiderosis (IPH) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-pulmonary-hemosiderosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The clinical features, treatment, and prognosis of IPH will be reviewed here. A general discussion of the diffuse alveolar hemorrhage syndromes is provided separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-diffuse-alveolar-hemorrhage-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The diffuse alveolar hemorrhage syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The etiology of IPH is unknown. However, the response to immunosuppressive therapy suggests that immune processes may be involved. It appears that a structural defect in the alveolar capillaries, either in the alveolar basement membrane or in the alveolar endothelial cell, may predispose to the condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-pulmonary-hemosiderosis/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>]. The accumulation of neutrophils in the alveoli also may play a role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-pulmonary-hemosiderosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunologic abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The degree to which immunologic injury to the lung contributes to the development of IPH remains unclear. Immune complexes have been demonstrated in plasma in several patients; however, immunohistochemical examination of lung tissue generally has <strong>not</strong> supported an immunologic pathogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-pulmonary-hemosiderosis/abstract/2,3,7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,7-10</a>]. The possibility that autoimmune mechanisms play a role in IPH is suggested by the observation that approximately 25 percent of patients with the condition who survive for more than 10 years subsequently develop autoimmune disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-pulmonary-hemosiderosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Links between IPH and ingested protein antigens have also been hypothesized, based upon the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Circulating antibodies against cow's milk have been detected in a number of children with the disorder, suggesting that IPH may be associated with a hypersensitivity reaction to milk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-pulmonary-hemosiderosis/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. However, other investigators have failed to reproduce these findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-pulmonary-hemosiderosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coexistence of celiac disease and IPH, also known as Lane-Hamilton syndrome, has been reported in a large number of cases, and introduction of a gluten-free diet has been associated with remission of pulmonary symptoms in several patients with IPH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-pulmonary-hemosiderosis/abstract/15-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-23</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-celiac-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of celiac disease in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-celiac-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of celiac disease in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Iron metabolism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recurrent hemorrhage can result in the presence of free iron in pulmonary tissue, which can eventually lead to pulmonary fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-pulmonary-hemosiderosis/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. The mechanisms involved may be similar to those responsible for the fibrosis in the liver, pancreas, and heart that occurs in hereditary hemochromatosis and other iron overload syndromes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-suspected-iron-overload\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with suspected iron overload&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The monocyte-macrophage system, which is involved in processing free iron, displays great heterogeneity between different organs. Alveolar macrophages are less able to degrade erythrocytes and reprocess hemoglobin iron than macrophages in the liver, spleen, and bone marrow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-pulmonary-hemosiderosis/abstract/24,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,26</a>]. It is thought that excess free iron leads to production of oxygen radicals and consequent tissue injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-pulmonary-hemosiderosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. However, iron induces intense production of intracellular ferritin, which protects the lung macrophages against free iron and oxidation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-pulmonary-hemosiderosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Anemia is observed in IPH due to alveolar hemorrhage and the subsequent accumulation of substantial amounts of iron within alveolar macrophages. The iron stimulates intracellular ferritin production and is initially stored in ferritin molecules, which are then processed into intracellular hemosiderin complexes. The iron in hemosiderin becomes functionally trapped and unavailable for the synthesis of hemoglobin by erythroblasts in the bone marrow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-pulmonary-hemosiderosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Nevertheless, the iron trapped in intracellular hemosiderin complexes stimulates the macrophages to produce ferritin, which subsequently induces an increase in the serum ferritin level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-pulmonary-hemosiderosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Other associations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The contribution of environmental factors to IPH remains speculative. Exposure to second-hand smoke and indoor molds, particularly Stachybotrys chartarum, has been suggested as a causative factor in infants with IPH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-pulmonary-hemosiderosis/abstract/28-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-31</a>]. Neither of these associations has been confirmed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In advanced cases of IPH, the lungs have a striking brown appearance due to hemosiderosis and varying degrees of consolidation and fibrosis. Light microscopy demonstrates alveoli containing numerous hemosiderin-laden macrophages as a characteristic but nonspecific finding. Thickening of alveolar walls is generally present and type II pneumocytes are increased in number. Localized interstitial fibrosis with collagen deposition is a prominent feature in patients with long-standing disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F60870%7EPULM%2F78396%7EPULM%2F79610\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60870 graphicRef78396 graphicRef79610 \">picture 1A-C</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-pulmonary-hemosiderosis/abstract/2-4,8,10,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4,8,10,15</a>]. Erythrocytes can be seen in the alveoli following recent bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-pulmonary-hemosiderosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>A key feature of IPH is the absence of histological or immunohistochemical evidence of capillaritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-pulmonary-hemosiderosis/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. In particular, infiltration with neutrophils and nuclear dust in the alveolar septa are not seen.</p><p>Electron microscopy demonstrates swollen, vacuolated alveolar endothelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-pulmonary-hemosiderosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The basement membrane of the alveolar capillaries may be focally thickened; localized discontinuities with rupture of the membrane have also been inconsistently described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-pulmonary-hemosiderosis/abstract/2,3,5,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,5,10</a>]. Absence of electron-dense material along the basement membrane is evidence against immune complex deposition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-pulmonary-hemosiderosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The exact incidence and prevalence of IPH are largely unknown. The estimated yearly incidence among Swedish children from 1960 through 1979 was 0.24 per 1,000,000 children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-pulmonary-hemosiderosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. A retrospective review of records from a tertiary pediatric hospital in northern Taiwan noted 5 cases over 25 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-pulmonary-hemosiderosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. There is no definite predilection for gender.</p><p>Eighty percent of cases of IPH occur in children, generally manifesting before 10 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-pulmonary-hemosiderosis/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. In adults, most cases are recognized before 30 years of age. Familial clustering has been described in several reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-pulmonary-hemosiderosis/abstract/12,39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,39,40</a>], suggesting that hereditary factors play a role in the development of IPH <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> that environmental factors might precipitate the disease in genetically predisposed individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-pulmonary-hemosiderosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>Older series of IPH probably included many patients who would not currently be considered to fit diagnostic criteria of the syndrome, including patients with antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis (such as granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener&rsquo;s) and microscopic polyarteritis nodosa) and other collagen vascular disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-pulmonary-hemosiderosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Sensitive assays for detection of autoimmune antibodies, new scintigraphic methods, and less invasive techniques for lung biopsy have permitted a more refined classification of patients with diffuse alveolar hemorrhage that were not available when early series were performed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-diffuse-alveolar-hemorrhage-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The diffuse alveolar hemorrhage syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical presentation of IPH varies from an acute onset illness with hemoptysis and dyspnea to an insidious process characterized by fatigue, anemia, and slowly progressive exertional dyspnea. In some cases, anemia is the sole presenting sign.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms and signs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IPH often begins in children with recurrent episodes of dyspnea and cough. Initially, the cough is predominantly nonproductive. Hemoptysis, occasionally with large amounts of expectorated blood, occurs later. Eventually, children develop moderate to severe anemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-diffuse-alveolar-hemorrhage-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The diffuse alveolar hemorrhage syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In adults, the most frequent symptoms are exertional dyspnea and fatigue due to pulmonary hemorrhage and iron deficiency anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-pulmonary-hemosiderosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Nearly all adult patients develop hemoptysis, which may range from occasional blood-streaked sputum to daily significant hemoptysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-pulmonary-hemosiderosis/abstract/8,12,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,12,39</a>]. In children, failure to thrive and anemia may be the presenting findings and hemoptysis is less common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-pulmonary-hemosiderosis/abstract/1,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,42</a>]. Rapid asphyxiation due to massive pulmonary hemorrhage has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-pulmonary-hemosiderosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=massive-hemoptysis-initial-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Massive hemoptysis: Initial management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children may fail to thrive and appear pale and anemic. Cough and dyspnea at rest or with exertion may be prominent. Lung examination may reveal clear lungs or crackles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-pulmonary-hemosiderosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Approximately 20 percent have enlargement of the liver <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> spleen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-pulmonary-hemosiderosis/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Iron deficiency anemia, which can range from mild to severe, is generally the sole laboratory abnormality in patients with IPH. Presence of coagulopathy, thrombocytopenia, hepatic dysfunction, or glomerulonephritis would suggest an alternate diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-diffuse-alveolar-hemorrhage-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The diffuse alveolar hemorrhage syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Neutropenia and eosinophilia have been reported 5 to 10 days before the onset of alveolar hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-pulmonary-hemosiderosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Bone marrow biopsy typically shows hyperplastic erythropoiesis, usually without stainable hemosiderin iron [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-pulmonary-hemosiderosis/abstract/8,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,37</a>]. Estimation of the mean erythrocyte survival time using chromium-51-labeled autologous erythrocytes shows a reduced survival time due to deposition of erythrocytes in the lungs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-pulmonary-hemosiderosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Plasma bilirubin and urinary excretion of urobilinogen may be increased. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-diagnosis-of-iron-deficiency-and-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and diagnosis of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-anemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with anemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Several caveats apply to approaching anemia in patients with IPH:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following a bleeding episode, a high number of reticulocytes may be present in the blood, mimicking hemolytic anemia. However, specific tests for hemolysis are negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-pulmonary-hemosiderosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-hemolytic-anemia-in-the-adult\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of hemolytic anemia in the adult&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Since hemorrhagic sputum is often swallowed, children often present with a positive test for fecal occult blood. This can result in an exhaustive search for a source of gastrointestinal bleeding. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-occult-gastrointestinal-bleeding\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of occult gastrointestinal bleeding&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum ferritin concentrations, which in healthy subjects reflect mobilizable body iron stores, may be misleading in IPH because they apparently also reflect the nonmobilizable hemosiderin iron located in the lungs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-pulmonary-hemosiderosis/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. Cases of IPH with normal serum ferritin despite iron deficiency anemia have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-pulmonary-hemosiderosis/abstract/8,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,42</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiographic findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following an acute episode with pulmonary bleeding, chest radiographs demonstrate opacities that subsequently can regress during the symptom-free phase (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F62374\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef62374 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F50621\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef50621 \">image 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-pulmonary-hemosiderosis/abstract/8,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,37</a>]. These opacities have ground-glass characteristics on high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan. Unilateral or bilateral poorly defined opacities with an alveolar filling pattern are most prominent in the middle and lower lung fields. The opacities vary in intensity according to the magnitude of alveolar bleeding and the period of time elapsed since the latest bleeding episode. Patients with long-standing disease may occasionally develop multiple honeycomb cysts, which are characteristically focal and localized predominantly to the posterior and lateral basal segments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-pulmonary-hemosiderosis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-resolution-computed-tomography-of-the-lungs\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;High resolution computed tomography of the lungs&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Ventilation-perfusion scanning, normally used to aid in the diagnosis of pulmonary emboli, also can be employed to demonstrate intrapulmonary bleeding. In cases of ongoing pulmonary hemorrhage, perfusion scanning with 99mTc-labeled albumin particles (diameter 15 to 25 micrometers) reveals foci of high radioactivity in the lungs where radioactively tagged material has extravasated into the alveoli.</p><p>Alternatively, ongoing intrapulmonary bleeding can be visualized by pulmonary radioscintigraphy, in which autologous erythrocytes labeled with 51Cr or 99mTc are injected intravenously with subsequent recording of the radioactivity over the lungs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-pulmonary-hemosiderosis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. However, bronchoalveolar lavage has largely replaced use of nuclear scans for diagnosis of pulmonary bleeding.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulmonary function tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pulmonary function testing shows restrictive abnormalities, with reductions in TLC, FVC, and a normal or increased <span class=\"nowrap\">FEV1/FVC</span> ratio [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-pulmonary-hemosiderosis/abstract/8,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,47</a>]. Varying degrees of hypoxemia with eucapnia or hypocapnia occur, and frequently worsen with exercise.</p><p>During an acute bleeding episode, hemoglobin in erythrocytes that have spilled into the alveoli avidly bind carbon monoxide, thereby producing an inappropriately high DLCO [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-pulmonary-hemosiderosis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. When the intraalveolar erythrocytes and the hemoglobin they contain are degraded, the DLCO declines to prehemorrhage levels, and may be chronically reduced in cases in which parenchymal fibrosis has developed. While theoretically helpful, measurement of DLCO in the setting of acute hemoptysis is often not feasible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Sputum examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A clinical suspicion of alveolar hemorrhage can be substantiated by examination of a representative sputum sample containing alveolar macrophages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/idiopathic-pulmonary-hemosiderosis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Prussian blue staining for iron demonstrates the presence of hemosiderin-laden alveolar macrophages. However, this test does not appear to be highly sensitive, and a negative result should not preclude further work-up if indicated clinically. In addition, bronchoalveolar lavage is usually needed to evaluate other causes of DAH, such as infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Bronchoalveolar lavage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is usually performed in segments of the lung where HRCT shows ground-glass opacification, or in the right middle lobe if disease is diffuse. Three sequential instillations are performed at the same site; observation of progressively more hemorrhagic fluid with each successive lavage suggests alveolar hemorrhage. Differential cell counts of BAL fluid show a predominance of alveolar macrophages, typically containing hemosiderin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F52119\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52119 \">picture 2</a>). Lavage fluid is sent for culture to exclude infectious etiologies and cytologic analysis to quantitate hemosiderin-laden macrophages and look for viral inclusion bodies.

The diagnosis is supported by the combination of compatible clinical findings (eg, hemoptysis, cough, dyspnea), compatible laboratory findings (eg, opacities on chest radiograph, iron deficiency anemia), and the finding of hemosiderin-laden alveolar macrophages on BAL and lung biopsy specimens.</p><p>Our diagnostic approach is outlined in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F80333\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef80333 \">algorithm 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should have their anemia classified by appropriate laboratory tests, which may reveal an iron deficiency anemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F76236\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76236 \">table 2</a>).

Patients should also be screened for celiac disease with serologic tests for IgA anti tissue transglutaminase and endomysial antibodies. Patients should also be tested for antibodies against cow's milk (IgG and IgE).

Transbronchial lung biopsy has a reasonable yield for providing supportive pathologic data, and should be the biopsy procedure of first choice in stable adults. Four to eight transbronchial biopsy specimens should be obtained from one lung, preferably taken in segments showing ground-glass opacification. If a diagnosis cannot be made on these relatively small biopsy specimens, larger samples should be obtained by video assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) or open lung biopsy.

In addition to light microscopy, biopsy specimens, preferably frozen, should be examined with immunofluorescence-technique using a panel of antibodies against immunoglobulins and complement fractions in order to search for immune complexes.

Many patients develop iron deficiency anemia due to sequestration of red cell hemoglobin iron to hemosiderin iron in the alveoli. After recurrent episodes of hemorrhage, pulmonary fibrosis may develop due to iron accumulation. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During an acute episode, the chest radiograph and high resolution computed tomography demonstrate ground glass alveolar opacities that are often bilateral. Examination of sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid reveals hemosiderin-laden alveolar macrophages, but the final diagnosis requires lung biopsy documentation of large numbers of hemosiderin-laden macrophages in the alveoli, without evidence of vasculitis, capillaritis, inflammation, granulomas, or deposition of immunoglobulins in any specific pattern.
