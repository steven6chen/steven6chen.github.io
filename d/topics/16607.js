Surgical repair is the treatment of choice for operative candidates who have a full-thickness rectal procidentia. Multiple procedures exist for the repair of rectal procidentia; however, there is no consensus as to which procedure is most effective in regard to recurrence rate, bowel function, and risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-approach-to-rectal-procidentia-rectal-prolapse/abstract/4-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-13</a>]. </p><p>Concomitant pelvic organ prolapse can be present in up to one-third of patients who present with rectal prolapse.

It is critical for the surgeon to inform the patient and family about the potential for complications with each approach. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3456734087\"><span class=\"h2\">Candidates for abdominal surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For those who are candidates (physically fit) for an abdominal procedure, we suggest an abdominal rather than a perineal repair. Recurrence rates after an abdominal repair are generally lower than after a perineal repair (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F109119\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109119 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H100798135\" class=\"local\">'Recurrence'</a> below.) </p><p>For patients undergoing an abdominal repair, we suggest performing a rectopexy rather than no rectopexy. In a randomized trial, patients who did not undergo a rectopexy had a higher recurrence rate than patients who underwent a rectopexy (8.6 versus 1.5 percent, odds ratio 6.32, 95% CI 1.36-29.47) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-approach-to-rectal-procidentia-rectal-prolapse/abstract/4,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7</a>]. The technique of rectopexy (suture versus mesh) is determined by surgeon preference, as one technique has not been shown to be superior to others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-approach-to-rectal-procidentia-rectal-prolapse/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H10292352\" class=\"local\">'Rectopexy'</a> below.)</p><p>For patients who have preexisting constipation, we further suggest a sigmoid resection to be performed concomitantly with rectopexy. Patients without baseline constipation should undergo a rectopexy without concomitant sigmoid resection. Sigmoid resection has been shown to reduce constipation in those who report this symptom preoperatively. Preexisting constipation is elicited by obtaining a thorough patient history, including the frequency of bowel movements <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> other symptoms that may be suggestive of obstructive defecation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-evaluation-of-chronic-constipation-in-adults#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and evaluation of chronic constipation in adults&quot;, section on 'History'</a>.) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Abdominal procedures for rectal procidentia can be performed with open or one of the minimally invasive techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-approach-to-rectal-procidentia-rectal-prolapse/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Although minimally invasive rectal procidentia repair is safe and effective, it has not been shown to be superior to open surgery in patient-important outcomes such as recurrence or postoperative bowel function. Thus, the operative approach should be determined by the surgeon; minimally invasive surgery is an option when the requisite expertise and equipment are available. (See <a href=\"#H10292551\" class=\"local\">'Abdominal procedures'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1220168248\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients who are not candidates for abdominal surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients who are not candidates (physically unfit) for an abdominal procedure, we use one of the perineal procedures to repair their rectal procidentia. In general, the perineal procedures are better tolerated than abdominal procedures because they can be performed without general anesthesia and result in fewer complications and less pain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F109119\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109119 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H10292302\" class=\"local\">'Perineal procedures'</a> below.)</p><p>For technical reasons, a perineal mucosal sleeve resection and muscular plication of the rectal procidentia (Delorme procedure) are typically performed for short-segment (&lt;3 to 4 cm) rectal prolapse; a perineal rectosigmoidectomy (Altemeier procedure) is performed for rectal procidentias that are longer. (See <a href=\"#H10292302\" class=\"local\">'Perineal procedures'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10292286\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGICAL PROCEDURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10292551\"><span class=\"h2\">Abdominal procedures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Proper transabdominal rectal procidentia repair includes rectal mobilization, sigmoid resection (when indicated), and fixation of the rectum to the sacral promontory by mesh or nonabsorbable sutures (rectopexy). The techniques used for rectal mobilization (anterior versus posterior) and rectopexy (suture versus mesh), as well as the surgical approach (open, laparoscopic, or robotic), are not standardized and depend upon the surgeon's preference and expertise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-approach-to-rectal-procidentia-rectal-prolapse/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H473259196\"><span class=\"h3\">Rectal mobilization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first step of any abdominal procedure is to mobilize the rectum. Although surgeons differ in their techniques of rectal mobilization (posterior, anterior, or a combination of both), it is generally agreed that the lateral stalks of the rectum should be preserved during dissection because they contain nerves that innervate the rectum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F62931\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62931 \">figure 1</a>). Division of the lateral stalks during rectal mobilization may cause worsening or new-onset constipation postoperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-approach-to-rectal-procidentia-rectal-prolapse/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, preservation of the lateral stalks may increase the recurrence rate of rectal procidentia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-approach-to-rectal-procidentia-rectal-prolapse/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>In our practice, the general steps of rectal mobilization include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mobilize the rectum posteriorly from the pelvic floor to the tip of the coccyx, preserving the lateral stalks. The hypogastric nerves are preserved at the level of the sacral promontory (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F56679\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56679 \">figure 2</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In women, mobilize the rectum anteriorly to the level of the mid to upper-third of the vagina. In men, mobilize the rectum anteriorly for a few centimeters to allow for straightening of the rectum and additional scarring. However, the efficacy of the anterior mobilization to prevent relapse or improve functional outcome is unknown. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10292352\"><span class=\"h3\">Rectopexy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A rectopexy is performed by affixing the pararectal tissue to the presacral <span class=\"nowrap\">fascia/sacral</span> periosteum in the sacral promontory using nonabsorbable sutures or mesh. As discussed above, rectopexy has been shown to reduce recurrences when compared with nonrectopexy. (See <a href=\"#H3456734087\" class=\"local\">'Candidates for abdominal surgery'</a> above.)</p><p>Rectopexy is used to treat rectal procidentia in patients who do not have a concomitant pelvic floor abnormality. In such patients, it is assumed that prolapse occurs because the rectum is abnormally straightened from the downward forces of defecation, rather than due to pelvic floor weakness or an enlarged peritoneal sac. Patients who have a concomitant pelvic organ prolapse may require additional surgical repair by a gynecologist or urologist. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-organ-prolapse-in-women-choosing-a-primary-surgical-procedure#H2327248\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic organ prolapse in women: Choosing a primary surgical procedure&quot;, section on 'General approach to choice of procedure'</a>.)</p><p>Rectopexy can be performed with sutures or mesh. In a small randomized trial of 63 patients, suture and mesh rectopexy resulted in similar rates of morbidity and mortality, postoperative incontinence, constipation, and recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-approach-to-rectal-procidentia-rectal-prolapse/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].
