The simultaneous recording of more than one ECG lead is often necessary to detect these changes. Most polymorphic VTs are rapid (often &gt;200 bpm), but an absolute rate has not been established, and VT at a slower rate can manifest changing QRS morphology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catecholaminergic-polymorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-and-other-polymorphic-ventricular-tachycardias-with-a-normal-qt-interval/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Some episodes of polymorphic VT cause hemodynamic collapse, and some degenerate into ventricular fibrillation (VF); however, many episodes terminate spontaneously (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F54538\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef54538 \">waveform 1</a>).</p><p>Polymorphic VTs are classified based upon their association with a normal or prolonged QT interval. Spontaneous polymorphic VT in the presence of a normal QT interval usually occurs in the setting of coronary heart disease or non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. However, some patients have no structural heart disease and may have a familial syndrome.</p><p>Polymorphic VT associated with a normal QT interval will be reviewed here. Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia associated with a prolonged QT interval, which has a different etiology and mechanism, is known as torsades de pointes (&quot;twisting of points&quot;) and is discussed separately.

It occurs in 2 to 4 percent of acute myocardial infarctions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F54538\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef54538 \">waveform 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F67322\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef67322 \">waveform 2</a>), usually within the first 12 hours after the onset of symptoms. Polymorphic VT frequently accompanies episodes of coronary vasospasm (Prinzmetal's angina). In some patients, the arrhythmia may be the only manifestation of ischemia (without angina or other more typical symptoms) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catecholaminergic-polymorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-and-other-polymorphic-ventricular-tachycardias-with-a-normal-qt-interval/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The arrhythmia is not consistently related to electrolyte abnormalities, sinus bradycardia, preceding sinus pauses, or an abnormally long QT interval [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catecholaminergic-polymorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-and-other-polymorphic-ventricular-tachycardias-with-a-normal-qt-interval/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Polymorphic <span class=\"nowrap\">VT/ventricular</span> fibrillation (VF) may also occur as a secondary phenomenon in patients with severe heart failure or cardiogenic shock complicating acute MI. Such patients have extremely high mortality, and there is no evidence that specific antiarrhythmic therapy improves mortality. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-treatment-of-ventricular-arrhythmias-during-acute-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and treatment of ventricular arrhythmias during acute myocardial infarction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although polymorphic VT after an acute MI is usually associated with a normal QT interval, some patients (8 of 434 consecutive patients in one series) develop typical pause-dependent torsades de pointes in association with progressive QT interval prolongation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catecholaminergic-polymorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-and-other-polymorphic-ventricular-tachycardias-with-a-normal-qt-interval/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. These events typically occur at days 3 to 11 during the healing phase of the infarct in the absence of recurrent ischemia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-long-qt-syndrome-definitions-causes-and-pathophysiology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired long QT syndrome: Definitions, causes, and pathophysiology&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia presenting with cardiac arrest may also manifest in patients with chronic coronary artery disease and remote infarction. In some cases, this can represent a variation of reentrant VT that is usually monomorphic in appearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catecholaminergic-polymorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-and-other-polymorphic-ventricular-tachycardias-with-a-normal-qt-interval/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Data supporting this are derived from observations in the clinical electrophysiology (EP) laboratory in patients resuscitated from cardiac arrest. Some patients that have only polymorphic VT induced in the baseline state have monomorphic VT induced after administration of intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procainamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">procainamide</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F101439\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef101439 \">waveform 3</a>). These patients show electrophysiologic characteristics very much like those of patients presenting with spontaneous sustained monomorphic VT, and they should be treated in a similar manner (ablation or arrhythmia surgery when possible, or ICD implantation).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1336820902\"><span class=\"h2\">Management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Polymorphic <span class=\"nowrap\">VT/VF</span> complicating the acute phase of myocardial infarction is associated with higher in hospital mortality. However, patients that survive the acute phase are at no higher risk of cardiac arrest or sudden death than patients with acute MI who do not experience primary <span class=\"nowrap\">PMVT/VF</span>. Thus, no specific antiarrhythmic therapy is indicated in such cases other than routine appropriate post-MI management. For patients in whom there is good evidence that acute myocardial ischemia (in the absence of acute MI) precipitates sustained polymorphic <span class=\"nowrap\">VT/VF,</span> coronary revascularization is usually an effective therapy, especially for those with normal or near normal left ventricular ejection fraction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catecholaminergic-polymorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-and-other-polymorphic-ventricular-tachycardias-with-a-normal-qt-interval/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, revascularization is not effective in all patients, most notably patients with significantly impaired left ventricular systolic function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catecholaminergic-polymorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-and-other-polymorphic-ventricular-tachycardias-with-a-normal-qt-interval/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. When cardiac arrest occurs in the latter patients, implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) implantation should be considered in addition to revascularization. </p><p>In addition to revascularization, pharmacologic anti-ischemic therapy should be considered, including beta blockers, nitrates, and calcium channel blocking agents. Suppression of acute ischemia may be accomplished with intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a> or, in patients with coronary vasospasm, the administration of a calcium channel blocker [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catecholaminergic-polymorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-and-other-polymorphic-ventricular-tachycardias-with-a-normal-qt-interval/abstract/2,7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7-10</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ranolazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Ranolazine</a> may also suppress some polymorphic VTs associated with acute or recurrent ischemia.

Both mutations appear to act by inducing diastolic calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. The resulting intracellular calcium overload leads to delayed afterdepolarizations and triggered activity, which can induce ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. It should be noted that mutations in these two genes have been recognized in only 60 percent of patients with CPVT, implying that other genes may play a role.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Cardiac ryanodine receptor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An autosomal dominant form of CPVT was initially linked to chromosome 1q42-q43 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catecholaminergic-polymorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-and-other-polymorphic-ventricular-tachycardias-with-a-normal-qt-interval/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Subsequent studies identified mutations in the gene for the human cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR2), which is also called the cardiac sarcoplasmic calcium release channel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catecholaminergic-polymorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-and-other-polymorphic-ventricular-tachycardias-with-a-normal-qt-interval/abstract/14,16,17,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,16,17,25,26</a>]. One report suggested that RyR2 mutations may account for at least one in every seven cases of sudden unexplained death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catecholaminergic-polymorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-and-other-polymorphic-ventricular-tachycardias-with-a-normal-qt-interval/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>RyR2 mediates the release of calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum that is required for myocardial contraction. The FK506 binding protein (FKBP12.6) stabilizes RyR2, preventing aberrant activation. The mutations in RyR2 in familial polymorphic VT interfere with the interaction with FKBP12.6, increasing channel activity under conditions in which RyR2 is activated (eg, simulated exercise, beta adrenergic stimulation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catecholaminergic-polymorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-and-other-polymorphic-ventricular-tachycardias-with-a-normal-qt-interval/abstract/25,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,28</a>]. The &quot;leaky&quot; RyR2 channels in these settings increase diastolic calcium release and can trigger life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias, probably via delayed afterdepolarizations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catecholaminergic-polymorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-and-other-polymorphic-ventricular-tachycardias-with-a-normal-qt-interval/abstract/25,28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,28,29</a>].</p><p>The clinical features of this form of familial polymorphic VT were evaluated in two unrelated families with 24 members who had experienced exercise-induced VT or syncope or had an episode of cardiac arrest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catecholaminergic-polymorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-and-other-polymorphic-ventricular-tachycardias-with-a-normal-qt-interval/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Some of the family members had delayed clinical manifestations, which necessitated continued observation and repeated evaluation. The cumulative incidence of sudden cardiac death by the age of 30 was 31 percent. Only one heterozygous carrier was clinically unaffected, suggesting high disease penetrance by adulthood.</p><p>The frequency with which RyR2 mutations occur in patients with CPVT was assessed in a series of 30 probands and 118 family members [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catecholaminergic-polymorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-and-other-polymorphic-ventricular-tachycardias-with-a-normal-qt-interval/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. RyR2 mutations were detected in 14 of the 30 probands (47 percent) and in nine family members, four of whom were silent carriers. The patients with RyR2 mutations, compared to those without such mutations, had events at a younger age (age at first syncope 8 versus 20 years), and male sex was an important risk factor for syncope. In contrast, 90 percent of the subjects without an RyR2 mutation were female. The distribution of arrhythmias in these 14 patients was polymorphic VT in seven, bidirectional VT in five, and catecholaminergic idiopathic ventricular fibrillation in two.</p><p>Two other types of RyR2 mutations differ from those associated with familial polymorphic VT in structurally normal hearts. A large genomic deletion in RyR2 that leads to polymorphic VT and extended phenotypes (including sinoatrial node and atrioventricular node dysfunction, atrial fibrillation, atrial standstill and dilated LV cardiomyopathy) has been identified in 16 members of two separate families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catecholaminergic-polymorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-and-other-polymorphic-ventricular-tachycardias-with-a-normal-qt-interval/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

Some individuals with sporadic disease have undergone genetic testing; some but not all of these patients have de novo mutations similar to mutations observed in patients with familial disease and have therefore been classified as having CPVT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catecholaminergic-polymorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-and-other-polymorphic-ventricular-tachycardias-with-a-normal-qt-interval/abstract/14,21,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,21,61</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are presently no consensus treatment guidelines for the management of sporadic polymorphic VT in an otherwise normal heart.

Similar recommendations apply to patients with idiopathic VF.

An unusual arrhythmia sometimes associated with digitalis toxicity is the so-called &quot;bidirectional&quot; VT in which the rhythm is regular but every other beat has an opposite axis as it travels alternately down different conduction pathways (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F71796\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef71796 \">waveform 4</a>). In most cases, the rhythm has a right bundle branch block morphology with an alternating left and right axis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/catecholaminergic-polymorphic-ventricular-tachycardia-and-other-polymorphic-ventricular-tachycardias-with-a-normal-qt-interval/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]; however, alternating right and left bundle branch patterns may be seen.

Appropriate management of the arrhythmia in this setting is not well defined, but prevention of ischemia, with revascularization if feasible, should be the primary goal. (See <a href=\"#H10798824\" class=\"local\">'Acute management'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1336820761\" class=\"local\">'Polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in coronary heart disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Polymorphic VT in patients without significant structural heart disease may be electrophysiologically similar to idiopathic ventricular fibrillation (VF). The management strategy in these patients usually involves placement of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD), although some patients respond to beta blockers. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Sporadic polymorphic VT in the structurally normal heart'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Catecholaminergic polymorphic VT (CPVT) is a genetic disorder that presents as familial as well as sporadic cases. Risk factors for sudden death include documented VF, a family history of sudden death, and onset of symptoms in childhood. Beta blockers are often given for primary prevention and should be used for secondary prevention, although the response is not uniform. Patients with one of the above risk factors for sudden death often receive an ICD with beta blockers. The role of left cardiac sympathetic denervation in patients refractory to beta blocker therapy has not been defined. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Catecholaminergic polymorphic VT'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Based upon the available evidence and expert opinion, we suggest the following approach to the treatment of patients with catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Immediate direct current cardioversion should be performed for life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias if hemodynamic compromise is present. (See <a href=\"#H10798824\" class=\"local\">'Acute management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We recommend administering intravenous beta blockers for suppression of recurrent VT (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H10798824\" class=\"local\">'Acute management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We recommend avoiding competitive sports and strenuous exercise (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1021006\" class=\"local\">'Avoidance of competitive sports'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We recommend the use of beta blockers for all adult patients with spontaneous or documented stress-induced ventricular arrhythmias (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Beta blockers'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For survivors of cardiac arrest or for patients with syncope or sustained <span class=\"nowrap\">VT/VF</span> despite therapy with beta blockers, we recommend placement of an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H6471335\" class=\"local\">'Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In patients taking a beta blocker who have received an ICD and who continue to have stress-induced ventricular arrhythmias, we suggest the addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flecainide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flecainide</a> for further arrhythmia suppression (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Verapamil</a> may also be considered in patients who are unable to take flecainide due to coronary heart disease or intolerance.
