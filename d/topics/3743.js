Hyperemesis gravidarum is the term used to describe the severe end of the symptom spectrum (including weight loss exceeding 5 percent of prepregnancy body weight), but no universally accepted criteria distinguish between mild and severe disease. Severe symptoms can negatively impact daily functioning, anxiety, work, and have led some women to consider termination of pregnancy or deter them from attempting future pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. </p><p>The clinical manifestations and diagnostic evaluation of women with nausea and vomiting of pregnancy will be reviewed here.

Supertasters are also at increased risk; by contrast, anosmic women appear to be at low risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Other risk factors include multiple gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>], hydatidiform mole [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], nonuse of multivitamins before six weeks of gestation or during the peri-conceptional period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>], and heartburn and acid reflux [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Studies of risk factors specifically for hyperemesis gravidarum have generally included only a small number of affected women, and results have not been definitive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/10,19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,19-21</a>]. Risk factors appear to be similar to those for milder disease. However, genetic factors or fetal origins of the disease also appear to play a role. In a population-based cohort study, daughters of women with hyperemesis were at significantly higher risk of developing hyperemesis in their own pregnancy compared with daughters of women without hyperemesis (3 versus 1 percent), while female partners of sons of women with hyperemesis were not at increased risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Other studies have reported a significantly higher risk of hyperemesis gravidarum in women whose sister or mother had the disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>], in monozygotic twins compared with dizygotic twins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], and in women with certain genetically determined conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/23,26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,26,27</a>].</p><p>Interestingly, studies consistently report a preponderance of female fetuses among pregnancies complicated by hyperemesis (odds of female fetus 1.27, 95% CI 1.21-1.34) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Alcohol use and cigarette smoking (perhaps due to the effect of nicotine and subsequent decrease in circulating estrogen) appear to be protective factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H83693497\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of nausea and vomiting of pregnancy is unknown. The predominant theories are described below.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Psychologic factors</strong> &ndash; Two general theories are that hyperemesis reflects (1) a conversion or somatization disorder; or (2) a response to stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. A feeling of ambivalence about the pregnancy has also been proposed as an etiologic or contributing factor. Although no study has definitively demonstrated that the psychologic makeup of patients with hyperemesis gravidarum differs from those without the disorder, the woman&rsquo;s psychological response to persistent nausea and vomiting may exacerbate her symptoms as a result of conditioning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hormonal changes</strong> &ndash; No single hormonal profile accurately predicts hyperemesis gravidarum. Elevated serum concentrations of estrogen and progesterone have been implicated in pathogenesis of this disorder. These hormones relax smooth muscle and thus slow gastrointestinal transit time and may alter gastric emptying. Although several lines of evidence support a role, especially for estrogen, the fact that sex hormone levels peak in the third trimester, long after symptoms of hyperemesis gravidarum have typically resolved, is not consistent with this theory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">By comparison, serum concentrations of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) peak during the first trimester, the time when hyperemesis gravidarum is typically seen. The observations that serum hCG concentration is higher in women with hyperemesis than in other pregnant women and that nausea and vomiting are worse in women with multiple gestations and hydatidiform moles, conditions associated with high hCG levels, also support a possible etiologic role for this hormone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. However, high hCG levels are not consistently associated with nausea and vomiting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. HCG isoforms or hCG receptor mutations may explain differences in symptoms among women with similar hCG levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/33,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The role of several other hormones in the pathogenesis of hyperemesis has been studied, but no consistent relationship has been found [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Abnormal gastrointestinal motility</strong> &ndash; Gastric motility may be abnormal (delayed or dysrhythmic) in women with hyperemesis gravidarum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Studies addressing motility disturbances have reported conflicting results, suggesting that these abnormalities are not highly predictive of the disease.

Gastroesophageal reflux results in heartburn and, in some individuals, nausea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. However, if this were the mechanism for hyperemesis, symptoms should worsen as pregnancy advances, rather than improve.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong><em>Helicobacter pylori</em></strong><strong> </strong>&ndash; Most women with <em>H. pylori</em> do not develop severe nausea and vomiting of pregnancy, but the infection may play a role in pathogenesis of disease in some women. In a 2014 systematic review and meta-analysis of 26 epidemiological studies, a significant association was found between <em>H. pylori</em> infection and hyperemesis <span class=\"nowrap\">gravidarum/nausea</span> and vomiting of pregnancy compared with asymptomatic controls (OR 3.21, 95% CI 2.01-5.10) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-evaluation-of-nausea-and-vomiting-of-pregnancy/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Summary sensitivity for diagnosis of hyperemesis gravidarum was 73 percent (95% CI 62.0-81.4) and specificity 55 percent (95% CI 47.4-61.5). However, there was significant heterogeneity among studies and most studies did not distinguish between active infection and past infection or strain of <em>H. pylori</em>.

The indices use a system that assigns points for the number of hours each day the woman feels nauseated, the number of times she vomits, and the number of times she has dry heaves.

Both serum free T4 concentrations and serum T3 concentrations are usually unequivocally elevated in pregnant women with true hyperthyroidism.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Treatment of hyperthyroidism should <strong>not</strong> be undertaken without clear evidence of a primary thyroid disorder (eg, goiter, elevated free thyroid hormone or elevated TSH receptor antibody levels).

Nausea and vomiting that develops after 10 weeks of gestation is not likely due to this disorder. Associated signs and symptoms, such as bilious emesis, abdominal pain, fever, headache, abnormal neurologic findings, diarrhea, constipation, leukocytosis, goiter, cyclicity, or hypertension, also suggest another diagnosis is likely; many conditions unrelated to pregnancy can cause persistent nausea and vomiting (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F78422\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78422 \">table 2</a>).
