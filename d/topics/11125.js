In a study in which MERS-CoV was grown in two different cell lines, high concentrations of IFN-alpha-2b or ribavirin were required to inhibit viral replication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, when used in combination at lower concentrations, IFN-alpha-2b and ribavirin resulted in a comparable reduction in viral replication as high concentrations of either agent alone.</p><p>In a study of rhesus macaques, two groups of three monkeys were inoculated with MERS-CoV through a combination of intratracheal, intranasal, oral, and ocular routes; one group was treated with subcutaneous IFN-alpha-2b plus intramuscular <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ribavirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ribavirin</a> beginning eight hours after inoculation, and the other group was not treated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In contrast with untreated macaques, treated animals did not develop breathing abnormalities and showed no or very mild radiographic evidence of pneumonia. Treated animals had lower concentrations of serum and lung proinflammatory markers, fewer viral genome copies, and fewer severe histopathologic changes in the lungs. In a study of common marmosets, either IFN-beta-1b or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lopinavir-and-ritonavir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lopinavir-ritonavir</a> resulted in improved outcomes when used for the treatment of severe MERS-CoV infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>In a retrospective cohort study in patients with severe MERS-CoV infection, combination therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ribavirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ribavirin</a> and IFN-alpha-2a, started a median of three days after diagnosis (20 patients), was associated with significantly improved survival at 14 days, compared with 24 patients who received only supportive care (70 versus 29 percent survival), but not at 28 days (30 versus 17 percent survival, a nonsignificant difference) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. There were greater declines in hemoglobin in the ribavirin-interferon group than in the controls (4.32 versus 2.14 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L)</span>. In other retrospective studies, combination therapy with ribavirin plus IFN-alpha-2a, IFN-alpha-2b, or IFN-beta-1a has not been associated with a mortality benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. It is difficult to interpret the results of these retrospective studies, and further evaluation in randomized trials is needed before treatment recommendations can be made.</p><p>Glucocorticoids have been administered sporadically to MERS-CoV&ndash;infected patients with no clear criteria for use and no clear conclusions regarding their effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/12,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,14</a>]. Glucocorticoids were extensively prescribed for patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), but review of this experience suggests overall harm rather than benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Their use is not recommended for MERS-CoV infections.</p><p>Other experimental therapies being investigated include convalescent plasma, neutralizing monoclonal antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>], an inhibitor of the main viral protease, <span class=\"nowrap\">entry/fusion</span> inhibitors targeting the MERS-CoV spike protein, and a prodrug of a nucleotide analog [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/16,20-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,20-32</a>].

This hypothesis is supported by an analysis pointing out that 14 of 19 (74 percent) patients with infection detected through routine surveillance died compared with 5 of 24 (21 percent) of secondary cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].</p><p>In a study of 47 patients with MERS-CoV infection in Saudi Arabia, case-fatality rates rose with increasing age, from 39 percent in those younger than 50 years of age, to 48 percent in those younger than 60 years of age, to 75 percent in those aged 60 years or older [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Several separate analyses have shown similar findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/63,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,65</a>]. In another study, independent risk factors for death among 939 cases reported to the Saudi Ministry of Health were age over 80 years, underlying cardiac disease or cancer, and acquisition as a hospitalized patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. In a study of 159 patients with MERS-CoV in South Korea, older age and preexisting comorbidities were risk factors for death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/middle-east-respiratory-syndrome-coronavirus-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.

Many additional cases and clusters of MERS-CoV infections have been detected subsequently in the Arabian Peninsula, particularly in Saudi Arabia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F95981\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef95981 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F89703\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef89703 \">figure 2</a>). Cases have also been reported from other regions, including North Africa, Europe, Asia, and North America (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F102411\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef102411 \">table 1</a>). In countries outside of the Arabian Peninsula, patients developed illness after returning from the Arabian Peninsula or through close contact with infected individuals.

(See <a href=\"#H1412660587\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An increased level of infection control precautions is recommended when caring for patients with probable or confirmed MERS-CoV infection compared with that used for patients with community-acquired coronaviruses or other community-acquired respiratory viruses. The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends the use of standard, contact, and airborne precautions for the management of hospitalized patients with known or suspected MERS-CoV infection.

The Ministry of Health of Saudi Arabia recommends that older adults, those with chronic diseases, immunocompromised patients, pregnant women, and children postpone their plans to travel to Mecca, Saudi Arabia, for Hajj <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> Umrah.
