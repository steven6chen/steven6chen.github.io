In normal subjects, sodium salts (mainly chloride and bicarbonate), glucose, and urea are the primary circulating solutes. If no other solutes are present in serum at high millimolar concentrations, then these three solute concentrations can be used to predict the measured osmolality. A variety of formulas have been evaluated for this purpose, and the following relationship is acceptable for practical clinical purposes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-osmolal-gap/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>]:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160;Calculated Sosm &#160; = &#160; (2 &#160;x &#160;serum [Na, in <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> &#160;+ &#160;[glucose, in <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL]/18</span> &#160;+ [blood urea nitrogen, in <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL]/2</span>.8</p></div></div><p>Or, with international units (all of which are in <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L):</span></p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160;Calculated Sosm &#160; = &#160; (2 &#160;x &#160;serum [Na]) &#160;+ &#160;[glucose] &#160;+ [urea]</p></div></div><p>The serum sodium is multiplied by two to account for the osmolal contributions of the accompanying anions (chloride and bicarbonate), and, in the first formula, the divisors 18 and 2.8 convert units of <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> to <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg</span> (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-serum-osmolal-gap\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-serum-osmolal-gap-si-units\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-osmolal-gap/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1171071391\"><span class=\"h1\">MEASUREMENT OF SERUM OSMOLALITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Osmolality is a colligative property that is related to the ratio of the number of solute particles to the number of solvent molecules in the solution. Colligative properties affect the freezing point, boiling point, and vapor pressure or dew point of any solution. Increasing the osmolality reduces the temperature at which the solution freezes, reduces the solution's vapor pressure or dew point, and raises the boiling point temperature. The osmolality of serum (or any other aqueous solution) can be determined by measuring any of these colligative properties. The most commonly used clinical osmometers measure the temperature at which the solution freezes. Solute-free water freezes at 0&ordm;C. In general, if 1,000 mosmol of any relatively small solute (or combination of solutes) is added to 1 kg of water, the freezing point of this solution will be depressed by 1.86&ordm;C. This relationship can be used to calculate the osmotic concentration of a solution. As an example, the freezing point of the plasma water is normally approximately -0.521&ordm;C. This represents an osmolality of 0.280 <span class=\"nowrap\">osmol/kg</span> (0.521 &divide; 1.86) or 280 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg</span>.</p><p>Osmometers that are based upon vapor pressure depression are much less frequently utilized by clinical laboratories. These devices are less useful in certain circumstances because volatile solutes do not reduce vapor pressure as much as equimolar concentrations of nonvolatile solutes. Consequently, the osmolal contribution of ethanol, methanol, ethylene glycol, and isopropyl alcohol in serum is underestimated by vapor pressure osmometers. Thus, vapor pressure osmometry should not be utilized diagnostically when these poisonings are suspected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-osmolal-gap/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].

Some of these solutes readily penetrate the cell membrane (ethanol, methanol, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, isopropanol), some can generate water shifts because they exert &quot;tonicity&quot; (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mannitol</a> or, in patients given intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a>, sucrose or maltose), and some produce hyponatremia because they are absorbed as hypotonic solutions (glycine or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sorbitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sorbitol</a> as irrigant solutions in transurethral prostate resection or hysteroscopy). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The measured sodium concentration may be spuriously reduced (called pseudohyponatremia) as a result of marked hyperlipidemia or hyperproteinemia. When this occurs, the concentration of sodium in serum water remains unchanged, and it is this concentration that determines the measured serum osmolality. Certain electrolyte analyzers (for example, those utilizing flame photometers or indirect ion-selective electrode methodology) can generate an artificially reduced sodium concentration under such conditions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hyponatremia-in-adults#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hyponatremia in adults&quot;, section on 'Pseudohyponatremia'</a>.)</p><p/><p>As noted above, detection of an elevated serum osmolal gap when it is generated by any volatile solute, including methanol, ethylene glycol, and isopropyl alcohol poisoning, requires utilization of a freezing point depression osmometer, not a vapor pressure osmometer.

The serum ethanol concentration can often exceed 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-osmolal-gap/abstract/3,5,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5,12</a>], but even moderate levels will generate a significant serum osmolal gap. </p><p>It had been assumed that the osmolal contribution of ethanol to serum osmolality would be approximately equal to its molar concentration. Since ethanol has a molecular weight of 46 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mmol,</span> its osmolal contribution should be equal to the serum ethanol level in <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/100</span> mL divided by 4.6. However, ethanol also<strong> </strong>reduces the effective serum water volume and therefore contributes more osmoles per unit weight than the above calculation predicts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-osmolal-gap/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. In a study of 98 observations in which the mean ethanol concentration was 198 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> the osmolal contribution of ethanol was best estimated by dividing the ethanol concentration by 3.7 rather than dividing by 4.6 (if standard units are utilized, then multiply by 1.25 x [ethanol]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-osmolal-gap/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Thus, if one wishes to include the contribution of ethanol to the calculation of the serum osmolality, the following equations should be used:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160;Calculated Sosm &#160; = &#160; (2 &#160;x &#160;serum [Na]) &#160;+ &#160;<span class=\"nowrap\">[glucose]/18</span> &#160;+ &#160;<span class=\"nowrap\">[BUN]/2</span>.8 &#160;+ &#160;<span class=\"nowrap\">[ethanol]/3</span>.7</p></div></div><p>Or, with international units (all of which are in <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L):</span></p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160;Calculated Sosm &#160; = &#160; (2 &#160;x &#160;serum [Na]) &#160;+ &#160;[glucose] &#160;+ [urea] &#160;+ &#160;(1.25 &#160;x &#160;[ethanol])</p></div></div><p>This calculation is particularly important when toxic alcohols or glycols are ingested because these toxins are often ingested together with ethanol.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">High anion gap metabolic acidosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Measurement of the serum osmolal gap is diagnostically helpful in patients with an otherwise unexplained high anion gap metabolic acidosis, particularly when methanol or ethylene glycol poisoning is suspected (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F77464\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77464 \">table 2</a>).

In the appropriate clinical setting, an elevated serum osmolal gap (greater than 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg)</span> is consistent with but not diagnostic of methanol or ethylene glycol intoxication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-osmolal-gap/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Although an anion gap metabolic acidosis is not always present, finding this combination increases the diagnostic likelihood of a toxic alcohol ingestion. Strong suspicion of this diagnosis should trigger therapies that inhibit alcohol dehydrogenase. These interventions block the formation of toxic metabolites and should generally be initiated before results of these toxin assays are available. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methanol-and-ethylene-glycol-poisoning#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Methanol and ethylene glycol poisoning&quot;, section on 'Alcohol dehydrogenase inhibition'</a>.)</p><p>Methanol is a small molecule (mol wt of 32), and ingestion (or absorption across the skin) can generate high serum concentrations. A serum methanol concentration of 80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> is equivalent to 25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg,</span> and this produces a similar increase in the serum osmolal gap. The increase in osmolal gap is less pronounced with ethylene glycol, which is a larger molecule (mol wt of 62). Thus, at the same serum concentration, ethylene glycol will raise the serum osmolal gap by only about one-half as much as methanol (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F52568\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52568 \">table 3</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-osmolal-gap/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

The possibility that the patient has also ingested ethanol must be considered, and, if present, its contribution to the osmolal gap should be identified and quantitated.

When metabolism converts the parent molecule to acid metabolites, such as formic acid (in the case of methanol) or glyoxylic and oxalic acid (in the case of ethylene glycol), their osmotic contribution disappears because each molecule of organic acid produced generates an equimolar disappearance of bicarbonate. Thus, this increase in organic anion osmoles is matched by an identical fall in bicarbonate osmoles. Consequently, the serum osmolal gap estimates the molar quantity of the <strong>uncharged</strong> <strong>parent</strong> alcohol molecules but <strong>not</strong> their acidic metabolites. </p><p>The result of these metabolic effects is that the osmolal gap reflects the concentration of the ingested alcohol or glycol and falls with its metabolism, while the anion gap acidosis is a consequence of metabolism and increases as the alcohol or glycol is converted to acidic products. Most often when a patient presents to the emergency department after one of these ingestions, elements of both conditions are present; that is, both an osmolal gap and an anion gap metabolic acidosis coexist. However, only the osmolal gap may be present in patients who present very early after ingestion, and only the anion gap metabolic acidosis may exist in patients who present very late after ingestion. In addition, co-ingestion of ethanol (which slows metabolism of these toxic alcohols and glycols) may reduce or even eliminate the development of the anion gap metabolic acidosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methanol-and-ethylene-glycol-poisoning#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Methanol and ethylene glycol poisoning&quot;, section on 'Plasma osmolal gap'</a>.)</p><p>These principles can be illustrated by the following example. The addition of 20 mmol of methanol to each liter of extracellular fluid will raise the serum osmolality by approximately 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/kg</span>. If all of the methanol is converted to formic acid, then 20 mosmol of methanol has been converted to 40 mosmol (20 hydrogen ions and 20 formate anions). However, the hydrogen ions will be largely buffered by bicarbonate. This causes bicarbonate to be converted to H<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> and then to H<sub>2</sub>O and CO<sub>2</sub>, which results in disappearance of both the hydrogen ion and the HCO<sub>3</sub>. The net effect is that, in each liter of extracellular fluid, 20 formate anions &quot;replace&quot; 20 bicarbonate ions, the serum osmolality then returns to its baseline level prior to the ingestion, and there is no serum osmolal gap.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9012219\"><span class=\"h4\">Other alcohols</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diethylene glycol is another toxic glycol that can produce both an osmolal gap and an often fatal anion gap metabolic acidosis. This glycol caused many epidemic poisonings when it was used as a solvent for various medications. The most famous epidemic occurred in 1937 (the &quot;Massengill Incident&quot;) when the S.E. Massengill Company used diethylene glycol in a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfanilamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulfanilamide</a> preparation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-osmolal-gap/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Other epidemics and sporadic cases have resulted from cough syrups (in Panama), toothpaste (which was produced in China), teething mixtures (Nigeria) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-osmolal-gap/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>], wallpaper stripping solution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-osmolal-gap/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], and antifreeze and brake fluids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-osmolal-gap/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. In addition, diethylene glycol intoxication is often associated with ingestion of counterfeit drugs, and a growing illegal internet drug market makes it a potential public health threat, particularly in Africa and Asia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-osmolal-gap/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. One of the principal metabolites of diethylene glycol is 2-hydroxyethoxyacetic acid, a potent neurotoxin that also produces a high anion gap metabolic acidosis and diglycolic acid, which is nephrotoxic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-osmolal-gap/abstract/18,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,20,21</a>]. Patients with diethylene glycol poisoning often present with gastrointestinal symptoms, evidence of hepatic damage and pancreatitis, and may have a delayed onset of encephalopathy, cranial nerve and peripheral neuropathies with fulminant ascending paralysis, and respiratory failure; bifacial plegia may occur in up to 50 percent of affected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-osmolal-gap/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Oliguric or anuric acute kidney injury can occur due to necrosis of the proximal tubular cells. Unlike ethylene glycol toxicity, there is no deposition of calcium oxalate crystals, since oxalic acid is not generated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-osmolal-gap/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Measurement of diethylene glycol in the serum establishes the diagnosis; however, it is not routinely performed, and the diagnosis often relies upon the history and clinical presentation. </p><p>The osmolal and anion gaps may also be elevated in patients who are treated with intravenous propylene glycol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-osmolal-gap/abstract/22-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-27</a>]. This pharmaceutical solvent is used to dissolve a variety of medications and becomes toxic when administered in large doses. Propylene glycol is metabolized to several products including both L-lactic acid and D-lactic acid as well as glyoxal. The combination of a large osmolal gap and a high anion gap acidosis in patients treated with medications dissolved in propylene glycol are hallmarks of this disorder. Most reported cases of propylene glycol poisoning have occurred in the intensive care unit setting when high doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lorazepam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lorazepam</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenobarbital-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenobarbital</a> are used to treat alcohol withdrawal or to induce a therapeutic coma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-osmolal-gap/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>].

Acetone is not an acid and does not produce metabolic acidosis or elevate the anion gap. Thus, isopropyl alcohol ingestion generates a large osmolal gap (both the isopropyl alcohol and the acetone contribute to the osmolality) but will not directly cause a metabolic acidosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isopropyl-alcohol-poisoning\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Isopropyl alcohol poisoning&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In contrast to methanol, ethylene glycol, and isopropyl alcohol, ethanol is rapidly metabolized to carbon dioxide and water.

Nevertheless, a small elevated serum osmolal gap can be seen in ketoacidosis and in lactic acidosis. Although some studies reported an osmolal gap in such patients, this was largely due to ethanol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-osmolal-gap/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In addition, the ethanol contribution was underestimated because the correction factor that was used was 4.6 rather than 3.7, which is now more widely accepted (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F52568\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52568 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/serum-osmolal-gap/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].

If the calculated osmolality is substantially lower than the measured osmolality, then pseudohyponatremia may be present. Inappropriate treatment to raise the serum sodium in patients with pseudohyponatremia (ie, when hyponatremia is a laboratory artifact) can result in serious morbidity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hyponatremia-in-adults#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hyponatremia in adults&quot;, section on 'Pseudohyponatremia'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Other</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An elevated serum osmolal gap can occur in a variety of other clinical settings.

In normal subjects, sodium salts (mainly chloride and bicarbonate), glucose, and urea are the primary circulating solutes. If no other solutes are present in serum at high concentrations, then these three solute concentrations can be used to predict the measured osmolality. A variety of formulas have been evaluated for this purpose (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-serum-osmolal-gap\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-serum-osmolal-gap-si-units\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Determinants of serum osmolality'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The osmolality of serum (or any other aqueous solution) is directly measured by an osmometer. The most commonly used clinical osmometers measure the temperature at which the solution freezes (freezing point depression). Osmometers based upon vapor pressure depression are much less frequently utilized by clinical laboratories. These devices are less useful in certain circumstances because volatile solutes such as ethanol, methanol, ethylene glycol, and isopropyl alcohol do not reduce vapor pressure as much as equimolar concentrations of nonvolatile solutes. (See <a href=\"#H1171071391\" class=\"local\">'Measurement of serum osmolality'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The measured osmolality and the calculated osmolality should be similar (generally within about 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/L)</span>. An elevated serum osmolal gap exists if the measured osmolality is more than 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mosmol/L</span> greater than the calculated osmolality. The cause of the elevated osmolal gap will often be apparent from the clinical context (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F81217\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81217 \">table 1</a>).
