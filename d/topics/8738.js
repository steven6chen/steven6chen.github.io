Its maximum damaging effect may be in the early stages of the disease. Through the production of cytokines and growth factors, for example, initial immune activation could create autocrine loops, which require no further stimulus to perpetuate the fibrotic and vascular lesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F67862\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67862 \">figure 1</a>). These loops could account for the relatively poor response to immune suppression seen in established SSc [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunomodulatory-and-antifibrotic-approaches-to-the-treatment-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

The latter may even have accelerated worsening of gastrointestinal and pulmonary involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunomodulatory-and-antifibrotic-approaches-to-the-treatment-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>A number of immunotherapies are being used in SSc with varying degrees of efficacy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F79035\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79035 \">table 1</a>).

Glucocorticoids should therefore be restricted to patients with myositis, active fibrosing alveolitis, symptomatic serositis, the early edematous phase of the skin disease, refractory arthritis, and tenosynovitis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-and-prognosis-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment and prognosis of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) in adults&quot;</a>).

However, the therapeutic potential of cyclosporine in SSc is limited by nephrotoxicity. In one report, for example, three of eight patients developed hypertension and acute renal failure after the onset of cyclosporine therapy; the causal relation to the drug could not be determined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunomodulatory-and-antifibrotic-approaches-to-the-treatment-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>There is preliminary information that suggests that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> may be helpful in controlling some aspects of SSc [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunomodulatory-and-antifibrotic-approaches-to-the-treatment-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. One study evaluated 10 patients without hypertension or renal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunomodulatory-and-antifibrotic-approaches-to-the-treatment-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Skin thickening diminished significantly, but there was no change in cardiac or pulmonary disease. Nephrotoxicity was seen at doses above 3 to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day. We do <strong>not</strong> use cyclosporine because its toxicity appears to outweigh any potential clinical benefit.</p><p>Controlled observations are clearly needed. It is also possible that other cyclophilins, such as rapamycin, will provide more targeted immunosuppression, improved efficacy, and less toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunomodulatory-and-antifibrotic-approaches-to-the-treatment-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Other immunosuppressive agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other immunosuppressive agents have been used in SSc with varying degrees of efficacy and have been evaluated in trials of varying scientific rigor.

Although these were not considered to be strongly suggestive of clinical benefit by the investigators, there is some evidence for superiority over placebo, especially with respect to modified Rodnan skin score (mRSS). The European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recommendations for treatment of SSc have thus offered some support to the use of MTX for skin disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunomodulatory-and-antifibrotic-approaches-to-the-treatment-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>A small study of rapamycin has been conducted, but it was not powered for efficacy analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunomodulatory-and-antifibrotic-approaches-to-the-treatment-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

However, the high incidence of treatment-related mortality (TRM) has limited its use in the management of SSc, and patients should be made to understand the potential risks of this procedure. The major complications associated with HSCT for SSc include treatment-related deaths, malignancies, and infections. The particular challenge is that cardiopulmonary or renal involvement from SSc may make the chemotherapy and fluid load associated with mobilization and conditioning extremely hazardous, and so early TRM is a particular risk. Careful assessment pre-HSCT is essential to minimize TRM.</p><p>Based upon emerging trial data and our own experience, HSCT may be most beneficial in selected patients with early, severe dcSSc. These patients may have moderate (but not severe) internal organ involvement and progressive disease despite an initial trial of immunosuppression. However, such patients should be referred for further evaluation to specialized centers with expertise performing HSCT for SSc. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-interstitial-lung-disease-in-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma#H27\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of interstitial lung disease in systemic sclerosis (scleroderma)&quot;, section on 'Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation'</a>.)</p><p>In a randomized trial (Scleroderma: <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Cyclophosphamide</a> or Transplantation [SCOT]) including 75 patients with severe SSc of five years' or less duration and pulmonary or renal involvement, patients were assigned to receive either myeloablative autologous HSCT or 12 monthly cyclophosphamide infusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunomodulatory-and-antifibrotic-approaches-to-the-treatment-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The primary endpoint was a global rank composite score that compared each individual patient with all other patients on the basis of a hierarchy of disease features assessed at 54 months, with rankings from highest to lowest for death, event-free survival, forced vital capacity, scores on the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index, and Rodnan skin score. In the intention-to-treat analysis, global rank composite scores favored transplantation over cyclophosphamide (67 percent of 1404 pairwise comparisons favored transplantation and 33 percent favored cyclophosphamide). Secondary per-protocol analyses of the global rank composite scores and traditional endpoints (ie, overall survival, event-free survival, modified Rodnan skin score, and disease-modifying antirheumatic drug [DMARD] use) were consistent with the primary outcome, favoring transplantation. The transplant-related mortality was 3 percent at 54 months and 6 percent at 72 months, which is less than that reported in previous studies. However, this difference in mortality from previous trials may reflect differences in baseline patient factors, such as the exclusion of patients with heart involvement or pulmonary arterial hypertension.</p><p>The Autologous Stem cell Transplantation International Scleroderma (ASTIS) trial, which used a nonmyeloablative transplantation, is the largest multicenter study of the safety and efficacy of treatment with autologous HSCT compared with conventional <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> therapy in patients with early dcSSc [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunomodulatory-and-antifibrotic-approaches-to-the-treatment-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. A total of 156 dcSSc patients were randomly assigned to receive either HSCT (n = 79) or 12 monthly pulses of intravenous cyclophosphamide (n = 77). The primary endpoint was event-free survival, which was defined as the time until death due to any cause or the development of persistent major organ failure (eg, heart, lung, or kidney). Secondary endpoints included TRM, toxicity, changes in skin thickening, organ function, and quality of life. HSCT resulted in worse early, but better long-term, event-free and overall survival:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During the first year, the number of events was higher in the HSCT group (13 versus 8 events). Most of these events in the HSCT group occurred during the first three to six months after transplant, and most were treatment-related (8 of 13). However, between the first and fourth years of follow-up, an additional two events occurred in the HSCT group compared with an additional 12 events in the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> group.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Since the increased number of events in the HSCT group occurred within the first six months, the event rate actually favors HSCT at one year (hazard ratio 0.52, 95% CI 0.28-0.96) and at four years (hazard ratio 0.34, 95% CI 0.16-0.74).</p><p/><p>Consistent with previous studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunomodulatory-and-antifibrotic-approaches-to-the-treatment-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/29,31,34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,31,34,35</a>], the ASTIS trial also found that HSCT was associated with significant improvements in lung function, skin softness, functional ability, and quality of life. However, HSCT produced a higher incidence of viral infections and a significant decrease in creatinine clearance. Finally, seven of the eight patients who died from HSCT-related causes were current or former smokers.</p><p>Patient selection is thought to be a critical factor in determining successful outcomes of HSCT. Specifically, TRM and lack of improvement of diffusion capacity may partly reflect the selection of patients with more severe cardiorespiratory disease that may not always be apparent on pre-HSCT evaluation. A retrospective analysis of 90 patients with SSc who underwent HSCT on a compassionate basis suggested that cardiac screening guidelines for HSCT for SSc should be more extensive, including right heart catheterization, a fluid challenge test, and cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in addition to echocardiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunomodulatory-and-antifibrotic-approaches-to-the-treatment-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Improvement in diffusion capacity was observed in patients with normal baseline cardiac function and electrocardiographic findings. In addition, the results of the ASTIS trial described above also suggest that the smoking status of patients may impact outcomes of HSCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunomodulatory-and-antifibrotic-approaches-to-the-treatment-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>These findings support the need for early referral of patients for HSCT, before cardiac dysfunction occurs, along with screening guidelines for patients with SSc under evaluation for HSCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunomodulatory-and-antifibrotic-approaches-to-the-treatment-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/35,42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,42,43</a>]. SSc patients should undergo standard screening for internal organ involvement as well as cardiopulmonary evaluations combining pulmonary function tests, echocardiography, cardiac MRI, and invasive hemodynamic studies if clinically indicated. In general, patients are selected based upon criteria used for enrollment in clinical trials that demonstrate a therapeutic benefit of HSCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunomodulatory-and-antifibrotic-approaches-to-the-treatment-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/34,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,41</a>]. As noted earlier, patients considered for HSCT should be referred to specialized centers with expertise in the procedure for further evaluation and treatment. Our approach to the pre-transplant cardiopulmonary evaluation for SSc patients is consistent with guidelines published by the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunomodulatory-and-antifibrotic-approaches-to-the-treatment-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">ANTIFIBROTIC DRUGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment of established fibrosis is a very difficult therapeutic problem, since there is no safe and effective method of removing excess insoluble cross-linked collagen fibers without damaging the structural framework of the body and individual organs.

This fact, alone, would justify starting an antifibrotic drug as soon as possible in patients with diffuse disease and possibly administering such a drug concurrently with an immunosuppressive agent.</p><p>The major problems with the available antifibrotic drugs are that they are slow to act and are often not powerful enough to prevent rampant fibrosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F81334\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81334 \">table 3</a>). As a result, escalation of the drug dose in the proper setting should be as rapid as possible.</p><p>Antifibrotic drugs are <strong>not</strong> necessary for cutaneous manifestations in patients with limited cutaneous SSc (lcSSc), but a careful watch should be kept for significant visceral fibrosis among such patients.

Treatment with penicillamine (750 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> for at least six months was associated with a 75 percent improvement in skin sclerosis (from 65 to 16 percent of total body surface) and with an 80 percent five-year cumulative survival rate. Renal disease was uncommon, and pulmonary disease was not progressive in patients treated for more than six months.</p><p/><p>These and other studies have noted that skin sclerosis worsened during the first four to six months despite therapy. This observation emphasizes the necessity for the development of a rapidly acting antifibrotic agent.</p><p>To assess the effects of high-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">penicillamine</a> on disease activity, 134 patients with early diffuse cutaneous SSc (dcSSc) were enrolled in a multicenter double-blind randomized study comparing high-dose (750 to 1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> with low-dose (125 mg every other day) therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunomodulatory-and-antifibrotic-approaches-to-the-treatment-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Sixty-eight patients completed 24 months of therapy. No significant differences were observed between the two treatment groups with respect to the skin thickness scores and the incidence of renal crisis and mortality. However, 16 of the 20 adverse event-related withdrawals occurred in the high-dose treatment group. Although this study could not answer the question of whether low-dose penicillamine is effective, there appeared to be no advantage in using high-dose penicillamine. Based upon the results of this key trial, we do not initiate penicillamine therapy for SSc. However patients who are stable on therapy may be continued, with dose reduction toward the low dose used in the controlled trial (125 mg every other day).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Interferons</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The interferons have been reported to be beneficial in the therapy of various diseases, including SSc. In particular, an antifibrotic effect has been reported in vitro. However, subsequent data have implicated interferons in the pathogenesis of some autoimmune diseases. Interferon (IFN)-gamma is a more potent inhibitor of collagen synthesis in vitro than IFN-alpha. It has other effects, however, which may contribute to aberrant cellular activation in SSc (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma)&quot;</a>). As examples, in vitro IFN-gamma can lead to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Macrophage activation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Class II antigen expression (DR, DP, DQ) on endothelial and fibroblast cells</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased interleukin (IL)-2 receptor expression</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased intracellular adhesion molecule-1 expression on endothelial cells</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunoglobulin G (IgG) Fc receptor expression</p><p/><p>These concerns have been apparently confirmed in uncontrolled studies in which IFN-gamma was associated with considerable vascular side effects, including renal hypertensive crisis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunomodulatory-and-antifibrotic-approaches-to-the-treatment-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. As a result, no controlled studies are planned.</p><p>IFN-alpha has received less attention than IFN-gamma. A pilot study of 14 patients with early diffuse disease of less than three years' duration found a significant measurable reduction in type I collagen synthesis by fibroblasts cultured from uninvolved skin and found stabilization or improvement in the skin test in 10 of the patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunomodulatory-and-antifibrotic-approaches-to-the-treatment-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>However, a multicenter double-blind study of 35 patients found that IFN-alpha provides no increased benefit compared with placebo and may be deleterious [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunomodulatory-and-antifibrotic-approaches-to-the-treatment-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. In this report, patients with early SSc were randomized to IFN-alpha (13.5 million units per week given subcutaneously for 12 months) or placebo. Compared with the placebo group, intent-to-treat analysis found that the group treated with IFN-alpha had more substantial skin involvement (as assessed by the skin score) and had a significantly greater deterioration in lung function (as assessed by the forced vital capacity [p = 0.01] or by the diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide [p = 0.002]).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Iloprost</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to vasodilating effects, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iloprost-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">iloprost</a> may also have antifibrotic properties. Among six patients with dcSSc, five days of iloprost infusion decreased the dermal interstitial fluid concentration of the profibrotic cytokine, connective tissue growth factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunomodulatory-and-antifibrotic-approaches-to-the-treatment-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. However, objective evidence of a clinically important antifibrotic effect has not been established. Iloprost is not available in the United States, but both oral and intravenous preparations are available in some other countries. It has not been determined whether its effects are shared with other prostacyclin analogues, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epoprostenol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epoprostenol</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Relaxin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A natural antifibrotic protein, relaxin, is produced during pregnancy by the uterus and the corpus luteum. It promotes the degradation of collagen and antagonizes the production of new collagen by fibroblasts. Despite encouraging trends in a small controlled trial, a subsequent larger multicenter trial did not find any benefit from relaxin, and withdrawal of relaxin was associated with serious renal adverse events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunomodulatory-and-antifibrotic-approaches-to-the-treatment-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>].

As discussed above, there is already evidence that conventional treatments such as parenteral prostacyclin suppress key profibrotic factors, such as connective tissue growth factor (CTGF). Endothelin antagonism may also attenuate transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta signaling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunomodulatory-and-antifibrotic-approaches-to-the-treatment-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha agents, while theoretically attractive, have not proven to be beneficial in clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunomodulatory-and-antifibrotic-approaches-to-the-treatment-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>].</p><p>When recombinant anti-TGF-beta1 (investigational agent CAT-192) was assessed in a small pilot study, no adverse effects were noted, but neither was there any suggestion of efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunomodulatory-and-antifibrotic-approaches-to-the-treatment-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. This result suggests that blockade of more than one isoform of TGF-beta may be necessary.</p><p>The use of combinations of anticytokine therapies (eg, the use of agents directed against both TGF beta and CTGF) is being explored [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunomodulatory-and-antifibrotic-approaches-to-the-treatment-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. In addition, it is possible that the vasoconstrictor peptide endothelin may have a specific role in fibrosis, and potentially broader use outside the complication of pulmonary arterial hypertension is being explored.</p><p>Other strategies that are being evaluated include blockade of IL-6-related pathways.

A growing understanding of the cellular and molecular events that lead to fibrosis and improvements in technology provide a favorable basis for the development of effective agents. Potentially promising approaches for the treatment of SSc include the following:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Imatinib</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Imatinib</a> mesylate, a protein tyrosine kinase inhibitor, is highly effective for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia and gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and limited data suggest possible benefit in patients with SSc. The selective inhibition of tyrosine kinase interferes with the signaling of both platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) and transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta, two pivotal mediators of the fibrotic process in SSc [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunomodulatory-and-antifibrotic-approaches-to-the-treatment-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p>An open-label prospective study of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> (400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> in 30 patients with diffuse cutaneous SSc (dcSSc), but without controls, showed improvement in modified Rodnan skin scores (mRSS) and in forced vital capacity compared with baseline after 12 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunomodulatory-and-antifibrotic-approaches-to-the-treatment-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Mild to moderate adverse effects were common, including edema requiring treatment with diuretics. The most common causes of dose adjustment or interruption in therapy were musculoskeletal complaints, fluid-related issues, intercurrent illnesses, gastrointestinal complaints, and constitutional symptoms (37, 27, 23, 23, and 20 percent, respectively). Randomized trials will be required to distinguish possible benefit from imatinib from natural history of disease or from effects of other interventions.</p><p>The theoretical basis supporting use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> includes findings of an in vitro study of fibroblasts from SSc patients, in which cells isolated and cultured from lesional skin were stimulated with TGF-beta and PDGF and were then exposed to imatinib [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunomodulatory-and-antifibrotic-approaches-to-the-treatment-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. This led to the inhibition of extracellular matrix protein production in a dose-dependent manner. In a separate study, imatinib blocked, in vitro, the <span class=\"nowrap\">Smad1/CCN2</span> pathway, which is also implicated in the development of fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunomodulatory-and-antifibrotic-approaches-to-the-treatment-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Furthermore, four case reports suggest that imatinib may reduce fibrosis in several clinical settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunomodulatory-and-antifibrotic-approaches-to-the-treatment-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/63-66\" class=\"abstract_t\">63-66</a>].</p><p>Other protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors are also being studied for possible antifibrotic effects.

After a follow-up period of approximately seven months, patients treated with a single course of rituximab demonstrated a significant improvement in the mRss. Among SSc patients with interstitial lung disease, rituximab also prevented a further decline in forced vital capacity compared with matched controls. There were no serious adverse events among rituximab-treated patients.

An ongoing prospective controlled trial comparing rituximab with intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> for the treatment of interstitial lung disease associated with SSc and other connective tissue diseases may help further define the effects of rituximab on SSc-associated lung fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunomodulatory-and-antifibrotic-approaches-to-the-treatment-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Intravenous immunoglobulin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several small, uncontrolled studies have evaluated the effect of intravenous administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> on dermal fibrosis, each with reported improvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/immunomodulatory-and-antifibrotic-approaches-to-the-treatment-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma/abstract/67,80\" class=\"abstract_t\">67,80</a>].
