In asymptomatic patients with severe AS, exercise testing is suggested to confirm absence of symptoms, assess exercise tolerance and assess physiologic changes with exercise (eg, fall in systemic blood pressure with exercise). Evaluation of symptoms in patients with AS is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aortic-stenosis-in-adults#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of aortic stenosis in adults&quot;, section on 'Symptoms'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aortic-stenosis-in-adults#H112932966\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of aortic stenosis in adults&quot;, section on 'Stress testing'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Identification of severe AS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nearly all indications for AVR for AS are for patients with severe AS, so determination of the severity of valve stenosis is a key step. Severe AS is generally identified by an aortic jet velocity over &ge;4.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">m/s</span> or mean transvalvular pressure gradient &ge;40 mmHg (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F95630\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef95630 \">table 1</a>); an aortic valve area &le;1.0 cm<sup>2</sup> is typically seen but is not required to identify high-gradient severe AS. Many patients do not develop symptoms until even more severe valve obstruction is present, while some patients become symptomatic when the stenosis is less severe, particularly if there is coexisting aortic regurgitation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aortic-valve-area-in-aortic-stenosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aortic valve area in aortic stenosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-aortic-stenosis-in-adults#H112078876\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of aortic stenosis in adults&quot;, section on 'Complications'</a>.) </p><p>Occasional patients who appear to have severe AS (eg, aortic valve area [AVA] &le;1.0 cm<sup>2</sup>) have a low gradient (mean gradient &lt;40 mmHg) across the aortic valve that can reflect one of three different abnormalities:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>True stenosis with LV systolic dysfunction that reduces the stroke volume and the transvalvular pressure gradient. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>True stenosis with normal LV ejection fraction and a small LV chamber, which reduces the stroke volume and the transvalvular pressure gradient.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pseudostenosis in which there is both moderate AS and a low cardiac output due to myocardial disease that is unrelated to the valvular lesion. The calculated valve area may mistakenly suggest severe stenosis in this setting because of valve area equation limitations when applied to low flow rate conditions.</p><p/><p>Distinguishing between these disorders is important because surgical correction of the valve lesion in pseudostenosis is associated with a high mortality rate and is less likely to be beneficial than in patients with true stenosis.

Insertion of a prosthetic heart valve is also associated with appreciable morbidity. Among the complications of prosthetic heart valves are prosthesis dysfunction, paravalvular leak, thrombus formation, thromboembolism, endocarditis, and the problems associated with anticoagulation. The incidence of serious complications depends upon the type of valve and a number of clinical variables, but significant complications occur at a frequency of approximately 3 percent per year, and death due directly to the valve occurs at the rate of approximately 1 percent per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-valve-replacement-in-aortic-stenosis-in-adults/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>].

Exertional dyspnea, <span class=\"nowrap\">presyncope/syncope,</span> and angina are the primary symptoms in patients with severe AS. Natural history studies have shown that average survival after the onset of these symptoms is only two to three years (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F81124\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81124 \">figure 2</a>). There is a high risk of sudden death in symptomatic patients who are followed conservatively. Although randomized trials comparing surgery with continued medical therapy have not been performed, observational studies have found that corrective surgery in this setting is followed by symptomatic improvement and a substantial increase in survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-valve-replacement-in-aortic-stenosis-in-adults/abstract/1,6-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6-12</a>].</p><p>The magnitude of benefit from AVR in patients with symptomatic AS is illustrated by the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective review of 99 elderly patients with AS and, in almost all, New York Heart Association (NYHA) class III or IV, follow-up at 55 months revealed that 91 percent of survivors were in NYHA class I or II (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52683\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52683 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-valve-replacement-in-aortic-stenosis-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective study of 144 symptomatic patients, survival at three years was 87 percent in 125 who underwent valve replacement compared with 21 percent in 19 nonoperated patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-valve-replacement-in-aortic-stenosis-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p>A limitation of such retrospective observational studies is that the better outcomes with surgery in symptomatic AS could be at least partly due to selection bias (ie, healthier patients are chosen for surgery). However, the magnitude of difference in outcomes between medically managed patients and those undergoing surgical valve replacement is greater than would be expected based upon patient selection alone. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Asymptomatic severe aortic stenosis</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Assessment of risks of surgical and medical therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recommendations for surgery in asymptomatic patients with severe AS are based upon consideration of the relative risks of surgical and medical therapy. As noted above, the operative morbidity and mortality of surgical AVR varies widely. If a patient's estimated surgical mortality is not well under 2 to 3 percent, then the operative risk clearly exceeds the risk (less than 1 percent per year) of sudden death in an asymptomatic patient who does not undergo surgery. Furthermore, valve replacement does not abolish the risk of sudden death. In one report that retrospectively analyzed the postoperative course of 599 patients, the late annual mortality was 3.6 percent; sudden death accounted for 24 percent of these deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-valve-replacement-in-aortic-stenosis-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. As noted above, significant complications of prosthetic valves occur at a frequency of approximately 3 percent per year, and death due directly to the valve occurs at the rate of approximately 1 percent per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-valve-replacement-in-aortic-stenosis-in-adults/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1561353293\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p>Thus, even if surgical mortality can be minimized, the combined risk of valve replacement and the late complications of a prosthetic valve generally exceeds the possibility of preventing sudden death in an asymptomatic patient.

The results of valve replacement are similar in patients with normal ventricular function and those with modest depression of LVEF (ie, between 40 and 50 percent).
