There are 3 different types of blood cells:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Red blood cells &ndash; These cells carry oxygen to your body.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>White blood cells &ndash; These cells fight infections.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Platelets &ndash; Platelets help clots form so that you stop bleeding after you are injured.</p><p/><p>Blood cells are made in the center of your bones, in a part called the bone marrow. Aplastic anemia happens when your body stops making enough of all 3 types of cells at the same time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13954917\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes aplastic anemia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aplastic anemia is caused by damage to your bone marrow. Some people are born with damaged bone marrow. In older children or adults, many things can damage bone marrow, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain medicines</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain chemicals</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infections from certain viruses</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Problems with your body's infection-fighting system (also called the &quot;immune system&quot;)</p><p/><p>But for many people, doctors don't know the cause of aplastic anemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13954932\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of aplastic anemia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some symptoms are the same as in other types of anemia. They include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pale skin or a pale color in the tissue that lines the inside of the eyelids &ndash; You can see this tissue (called &quot;conjunctivae&quot;) by gently pulling down your lower eyelid. The tissue will appear pale instead of its normal, pinkish-red color.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling very tired</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A fast heartbeat</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache and muscle pains</p><p/><p>People with aplastic anemia might also:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Get infections often</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have more bruising or bleeding than normal</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13954947\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for aplastic anemia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Tests include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests, including a &quot;complete blood count&quot; (also called a &quot;CBC&quot;)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bone marrow biopsy &ndash; For this test, a doctor will take a very small sample of the bone marrow. Then another doctor will look at the cells under a microscope.</p><p/><p>If your doctor thinks a genetic condition might be causing your aplastic anemia, he or she might do other tests, too.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13954962\"><span class=\"h1\">How is aplastic anemia treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment depends on the cause of your aplastic anemia. Treatment can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stopping medicines that caused the problem</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Staying away from toxic chemicals</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines &ndash; These can include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Antibiotics and anti-viral medicines</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Medicines that reduce the activity of your body's infection-fighting system (called &quot;immunosuppressive&quot; medicines)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood or platelet transfusion &ndash; During a blood transfusion, you will get blood that has been donated by someone else. During a platelet transfusion, you will get donated platelets. The donated blood or platelets go into your vein through a small tube called an &quot;IV.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Doctors try to avoid giving one person a lot of transfusions. They also try not to give blood or platelets donated from family members who might donate bone marrow later. That's because doing these things can make a bone marrow transplant work less well.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bone marrow transplant (also called a &quot;stem cell transplant&quot;) &ndash; This procedure replaces abnormal or missing cells in the bone marrow with healthy cells from a donor. These cells are given through an &quot;IV.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13954977\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-marrow-transplant-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Bone marrow transplant (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=complete-blood-count-cbc-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Complete blood count (CBC) (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-bone-marrow-transplantation-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Hematopoietic cell transplantation (bone marrow transplantation) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
