Within this category, tumors from many primary sites with varying biology are represented. Most cancers of unknown primary site are adenocarcinomas and can be recognized by routine histologic examination. However, 20 to 25 percent of CUPs are poorly differentiated and cannot be precisely characterized by histologic examination. About 80 percent of these poorly differentiated tumors have features of carcinoma, and are termed &ldquo;poorly differentiated carcinoma&rdquo; after initial pathologic examination. In the remainder, histologic examination results in the diagnosis of &ldquo;poorly differentiated neoplasm,&rdquo; signifying the inability to distinguish between carcinoma, melanoma, lymphoma, sarcoma, or germ cell tumor.</p><p>As accurate a diagnosis as possible is essential since the therapy for various tumors can be quite different and may be curative in some patients.

However, these markers are often elevated, and serial measurement may be useful in subsequently following the response to therapy in an individual patient.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1568144418\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathologic studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first step in the diagnostic evaluation of a patient with poorly differentiated CUP is review of the biopsy material.</p><p>A nonspecific light microscopic diagnosis can be due to a biopsy specimen that is very small or poorly preserved. In particular, tissue obtained by fine needle aspiration (FNA) often provides inadequate diagnostic material in patients with poorly differentiated tumors, because histologic detail is poorly preserved and the ability to perform special studies is limited by the small amount of tissue available.</p><p>Examination of poorly differentiated malignancies using routine light microscopy alone is inadequate. There are no light microscopic features that can reliably definitively distinguish between these different tumor groups and between chemosensitive tumors and those that are resistant to standard chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poorly-differentiated-cancer-from-an-unknown-primary-site/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Even with careful retrospective review of these cases, some tumors that are highly responsive to specific treatment regimens (germ cell tumor, lymphoma) cannot be readily distinguished morphologically.</p><p>Thus, tumor biopsies from these patients should undergo additional pathologic evaluation using immunohistochemistry (IHC). If the IHC results are inconclusive, gene expression profiling of the tumor should be performed. In selected cases, electron microscopy (EM) and chromosomal analysis should be considered if other results are inconclusive.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h3\">Immunohistochemistry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IHC is particularly valuable in identifying the tumor lineage (carcinoma versus lymphoma versus sarcoma, etc.) in patients with poorly differentiated neoplasm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F62750\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62750 \">table 1</a>). Once a poorly differentiated carcinoma has been identified, IHC can sometimes suggest a specific tumor type <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> primary site (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F56518\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56518 \">table 2</a>). IHC uses antibodies that are directed at specific cell components or products including enzymes, normal tissue components, hormones, and tumor markers. Such staining can be performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. Considerable technical expertise is required to perform these tests, and proper interpretation requires an experienced pathologist.</p><p>No IHC staining pattern is completely specific. However, a specific diagnosis is often suggested by the IHC results. Certain stains, (eg, [leukocyte common antigen [LCA] and prostate specific antigen [PSA]) rarely yield false positive results, while false positive and false negative IHC results are frequent with the others. Some carcinomas stain positively for vimentin and some sarcomas stain for keratin. Conversely, some poorly differentiated carcinomas lose all specific markers and are negative for keratin markers.</p><p>Examples of the potential utility of IHC in the evaluation of poorly differentiated neoplasms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monoclonal antibodies that react with antigens present on human white blood cells can reliably differentiate hematologic from nonhematologic neoplasms in formalin-fixed sections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poorly-differentiated-cancer-from-an-unknown-primary-site/abstract/4-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-8</a>]. In one study, immunostaining for LCA (CD45) was applied to 315 lymphomas and 420 nonhematologic tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poorly-differentiated-cancer-from-an-unknown-primary-site/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

As an example, in one study of 371 adenocarcinomas of breast, lung, and stomach, a large proportion (79 percent) of invasive breast carcinomas expressed bcl-2 compared with only 6 and 8 percent of pulmonary and gastric carcinomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poorly-differentiated-cancer-from-an-unknown-primary-site/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

To date, most of the development of these techniques has focused on predicting the tissue of origin in patients with carcinoma (usually adenocarcinoma) of unknown primary site. In these patients, gene expression profiling with currently available assays has a 75 to 80 percent accuracy rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poorly-differentiated-cancer-from-an-unknown-primary-site/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].

As an example, in a group of 30 patients who retained this diagnosis after extensive IHC evaluation (median 18 stains), gene expression profiling predicted the tumor lineage in 83 percent (carcinoma 10, sarcoma 8, melanoma 5, lymphoma 2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poorly-differentiated-cancer-from-an-unknown-primary-site/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Additional directed testing supported the gene expression profiling diagnoses in 11 of 15 patients. Specific sites of origin were predicted for all 10 carcinomas (including three germ cell tumors and two neuroendocrine carcinomas). Although the study was retrospective, the gene expression profiling diagnosis was used to direct therapy in seven patients (two germ cell, two neuroendocrine, two mesothelioma, one lymphoma), and five remain progression free for 25 to 72+ months.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Electron microscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Electron microscopy requires special tissue cutting and fixation, and is relatively expensive. For these reasons, electron microscopy should be reserved for neoplasms whose lineage remains unclear after light microscopy, IHC staining, and gene expression profiling.</p><p>Electron microscopy is extremely reliable in distinguishing lymphoma from carcinoma and is probably superior to IHC for the identification of poorly differentiated sarcomas. The presence of structures such as neurosecretory granules in neuroendocrine tumors and premelanosomes in melanoma can help identify these neoplasms.</p><p>Electron microscopy can also provide evidence for adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma in cases in which light microscopy is not distinctive. However, it is usually impossible to pinpoint the origin of poorly differentiated adenocarcinomas or squamous cell carcinomas by electron microscopic studies since few ultrastructural features are specific for any site of origin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/poorly-differentiated-cancer-from-an-unknown-primary-site/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Undifferentiated tumors often lose specific ultrastructural features as well as typical histology.

Approximately one-half of the cases arose in patients less than 18 years of age, and there was an equal distribution in males and females.
