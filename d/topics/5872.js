However, HCT carries many risks and costs, and for many individuals a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sibling donor is not available. Thus, the decision to pursue HCT is challenging and must incorporate information about the patient's age, health, and resources as well as the values and preferences of the patient and family.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2472167075\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications for HCT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transfusion-dependence due to thalassemia is the principal indication for HCT (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F113996\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef113996 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HCT has been studied extensively for beta thalassemia major, with excellent outcomes in selected patients, as discussed below and in the following section. (See <a href=\"#H1533155540\" class=\"local\">'Outcomes: HCT versus medical therapy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HCT for severe alpha thalassemia has been described in very few case reports either performed in utero or immediately after birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-transfusion-dependent-thalassemia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]; homozygous alpha thalassemia causes hydrops fetalis and is not compatible with survival in utero or soon after birth.</p><p/><p>HCT is generally used in children, with the precept that HCT should be performed as early as possible to avoid complications associated with chronic transfusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-transfusion-dependent-thalassemia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, there is no absolute age cutoff above which HCT cannot be used if the patient is healthy and can tolerate the procedure. Similarly, the lack of a sibling donor is not an absolute contraindication, as HCT using fully matched unrelated donors (MUDs) has been associated with success in some cases.</p><p>The ideal candidate is a child who has been treated with regular transfusions and chelation and who has an HLA-identical sibling donor; such a patient has a more than 90 percent likelihood of cure and a 4 percent risk of transplant-related mortality. For such patients, we suggest HCT rather than lifelong medical therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F113996\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef113996 \">algorithm 1</a>). The likelihood of cure decreases and the risk of death increases with older patient age, greater iron overload, and a less well-matched donor. Because the risks of HCT and medical therapy are very different, the values and preferences of the patient and family, availability of the procedure, and costs play a large role in deciding whether or not to pursue HCT. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-prognosis-of-the-thalassemias#H3879790468\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and prognosis of the thalassemias&quot;, section on 'Decision to pursue allogeneic HCT'</a>.)</p><p>HCT outcomes are best for individuals who have undergone rigorous medical therapy with transfusions and iron chelation, which minimizes the risks of organ damage from excess iron stores (see <a href=\"#H1533155540\" class=\"local\">'Outcomes: HCT versus medical therapy'</a> below). While it may be possible to pursue HCT in individuals with extensive iron stores, a previous episode of heart failure, or compensated cirrhosis, there is a greater likelihood of adverse outcomes in such individuals, and these increased risks may impact decision making. We generally would not pursue HCT for a patient with severe organ damage from iron overload (eg, uncompensated cirrhosis).</p><p>For adults who have undergone lifelong regular and consistent chelation therapy, outcomes from HCT and medical therapy are less well documented [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-transfusion-dependent-thalassemia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. We generally would favor continuation of medical therapy in such an adult. For children or adults who have not received regular lifelong transfusion and chelation, the risks and benefits are less certain, and decisions are highly individualized. For individuals with comorbidities such as renal failure or human immunodeficiency virus infection, we would avoid HCT because the risks of transplant toxicity would be too great.</p><p>Our approach is consistent with 2014 guidance from an international expert panel from the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT), of which the author is a member [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-transfusion-dependent-thalassemia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1533155540\"><span class=\"h2\">Outcomes: HCT versus medical therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no randomized trials comparing HCT with medical therapy for transfusion-dependent thalassemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-transfusion-dependent-thalassemia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Only a 2017 retrospective case-control study has been published, showing no statistically different overall survival with transplantation versus conventional medical therapy (eg, transfusions and iron chelation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-transfusion-dependent-thalassemia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Outcomes for both modalities (HCT and medical therapy) continue to improve with greater experience and refinements in management. Thus, assessment of outcomes generally must rely on the experience of transplant centers and comparisons across studies.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>HCT</strong> &ndash; Thousands of patients with thalassemia have undergone allogeneic HCT worldwide. Outcomes for HCT were illustrated in a 2016 retrospective series from the European Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) that included data from 1493 patients with beta thalassemia major transplanted after year 2000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-transfusion-dependent-thalassemia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Overall survival for the whole cohort at two years was 88 percent (range, 68 to 91 percent). Features that correlated with improved survival included the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Younger age</strong> &ndash; Younger patients had better outcomes than older patients, with an age threshold of 14 years or younger determined to be optimal. For the entire cohort, 1359 transplants (91 percent) were done in children, with a median age of 6.6 years. Two-year survival was 96 percent for those transplanted below age 14 years and 82 percent for those transplanted above the age of 14 years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Matched sibling donor</strong> &ndash; Use of HCT donors who were HLA-matched siblings was associated with better outcomes than partially matched related donors or MUDs. For the entire cohort, 1061 transplants (71 percent) were done with HLA-matched sibling donors. Two-year survival was 91 percent in the HLA-matched sibling group, 68 percent with a mismatched related donor, and 77 percent with a MUD.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Matched sibling umbilical cord blood or bone marrow</strong> &ndash; The use of umbilical cord blood or bone marrow from an HLA-identical sibling was associated with better outcomes than peripheral blood stem cells. Two-year survival was 93 percent with umbilical cord blood, 90 percent with bone marrow, and 81 percent with peripheral blood stem cells, a statistically significant difference.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">For all of these groups, approximately 6 to 8 percent of patients who survived HCT had recurrence of thalassemia (eg, due to graft rejection or graft failure), making thalassemia-free survival approximately 6 to 8 percent lower than overall survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-transfusion-dependent-thalassemia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The effects of recipient age and relatedness of the donor in this EBMT report are summarized in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F52120\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52120 \">table 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">These outcomes represent significant improvements since HCT for thalassemia was first pioneered in the early 1980s, and results continue to improve over time (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F113752\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113752 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-transfusion-dependent-thalassemia/abstract/7-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-13</a>]. Earlier studies established the importance of pretransplant risk assessment for iron overload (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F76537\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76537 \">table 2</a>), and improvements in chelation therapy and transplant techniques (conditioning regimen and supportive care) are likely to account for the improved outcomes. (See <a href=\"#H3335368\" class=\"local\">'Impact of iron overload (Pesaro prognostic system)'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Attempts to reduce mortality by lowering the dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> in the conditioning regimen have improved survival, but the risk of thalassemia recurrence was also higher. (See <a href=\"#H573785235\" class=\"local\">'Myeloablative conditioning regimens'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There are no specific data to support better outcomes in centers that treat patients with hemoglobinopathies; however, several centers worldwide have developed expertise in this population, and we advise transplantation in an experienced center that has the necessary facilities for a hemoglobinopathy patient available.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Medical therapy</strong> &ndash; Medical therapy (regular transfusions with iron chelation) has transformed thalassemia major from a lethal childhood disease to a chronic condition with survival into adulthood. Studies have documented progressively better survival over time, likely due to increased monitoring of iron stores, earlier and better use of iron chelation, and the availability of better-tolerated iron chelating agents.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A 2017 study involving 454 patients with thalassemia major treated with medical therapy in Taiwan reported a decrease in the annual mortality rate from 2.9 percent in 2007 to 0.7 percent in 2011; the oral iron chelator <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deferasirox-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">deferasirox</a> became available in Taiwan in 2007 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-transfusion-dependent-thalassemia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A 2008 study from the United Kingdom Thalassaemia Register found a decline in the mortality rate from 12.7 deaths per 1000 patient-years from 1980 to 1999 to 4.3 deaths per 1000 patient-years from 2000 to 2003 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-transfusion-dependent-thalassemia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. This was attributed to reduced deaths from iron overload, which declined from 7.9 to 2.3 deaths per 1000 patient-years. A modeling study that extrapolated from these and other data predicted a survival rate of 63 percent at the age of 50 years in resource-rich countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-transfusion-dependent-thalassemia/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A 2006 study involving 284 patients with transfusion-dependent thalassemia from Cyprus who were born after 1974 and treated medically found estimated survival rates of 100, 99, and 93 percent at 10, 20, and 30 years of age, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-transfusion-dependent-thalassemia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A 2004 study involving 720 patients from Italy who were born after 1960 and were treated with medical therapy reported that 68 percent were alive at the age of 35 years; survival improved progressively with each birth cohort [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-transfusion-dependent-thalassemia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Several of these studies have reported better survival outcomes in females than in males [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-transfusion-dependent-thalassemia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. This may reflect better adherence to chelation therapy in females.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Outcomes may also be better if care is provided by a specialized thalassemia center. This was demonstrated in a registry study from Italy that included 50 patients treated medically, in which most of the patients who received care at a specialized thalassemia center (30 of 41 patients [73 percent]) were alive at the age of 30 years, whereas all nine patients treated at a nonspecialized center had died by the age of 23 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-transfusion-dependent-thalassemia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">As noted above and in more detail separately, survival with medical therapy continues to improve and may exceed that described in the above reports. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-prognosis-of-the-thalassemias#H204296788\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and prognosis of the thalassemias&quot;, section on 'Prognosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p>HCT and medical therapy both have risks. HCT has a higher up-front risk of transplant-associated morbidity and mortality, but most of the patients who survive are cured of thalassemia. Medical therapy must be continued throughout life, and it carries risks associated with chronic transfusions (alloimmunization, transfusion reactions) and chelation therapy (neurotoxicity, renal toxicity, and others). Each approach has distinct, long-term outcomes that should be taken into account.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3335368\"><span class=\"h2\">Impact of iron overload (Pesaro prognostic system)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Outcomes from HCT correlate with the exposure to iron, including both the severity of iron overload and the duration of exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-transfusion-dependent-thalassemia/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H1533155540\" class=\"local\">'Outcomes: HCT versus medical therapy'</a> above.)</p><p>Thus, the importance of pretransplant iron chelation must be emphasized. It is not simply a matter of chelating iron immediately prior to transplant; chelation should be ongoing throughout the entire period of transfusions to prevent iron-induced organ injury. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-prognosis-of-the-thalassemias#H641704023\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and prognosis of the thalassemias&quot;, section on 'Assessment of iron stores and initiation of chelation therapy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iron-chelators-choice-of-agent-dosing-and-adverse-effects#H1161607\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Iron chelators: Choice of agent, dosing, and adverse effects&quot;, section on 'Indications'</a>.)</p><p>In the 1980s, the Pesaro group developed a simple prognostic system based on indicators of iron overload (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F67387\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67387 \">table 3</a>) to predict HCT outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-transfusion-dependent-thalassemia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The system includes three risk factors that were found to correlate with survival on multivariate analysis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Quality of chelation therapy received during the patient's lifetime before transplantation (regular versus not regular)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence of hepatomegaly (liver edge palpable more than 2 cm below the costal margin)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence of any degree of liver fibrosis at pretransplant hepatic biopsy examination</p><p/><p>Class I patients have zero risk factors and are defined by optimal control of iron stores for their entire lives. Class II patients have one or two risk factors, and Class III patients have all three risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-transfusion-dependent-thalassemia/abstract/11,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,21</a>].</p><p>Data from the Pesaro group on outcomes from HCT in children &lt;16 years of age with thalassemia correlated with survival at three years as follows (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F76537\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76537 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-transfusion-dependent-thalassemia/abstract/11-13,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13,22</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Class I &ndash; 94 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Class II &ndash; 80 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Class III &ndash; 61 percent</p><p/><p>Subsequent studies have defined the mechanisms by which excess iron stores interfere with good outcomes from HCT. As an example, in a retrospective study that evaluated outcomes in patients with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) following HCT, it was demonstrated that GVHD incidence and severity were similar in the three categories of patients, but the probability of surviving GVHD differed significantly. Mortality rates following acute grade III-IV GVHD were 27, 48, and 84 percent for low-, intermediate-, and high-risk patients, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-transfusion-dependent-thalassemia/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>In a study involving adults with beta thalassemia who underwent HCT, the risk class did not have a major impact on survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-transfusion-dependent-thalassemia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. However, patients in class III were given a lower dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> in the conditioning regimen (total dose, 120 rather than 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg),</span> which may explain slightly better survival in this group. (See <a href=\"#H1843281767\" class=\"local\">'Considerations for adults'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1843281767\"><span class=\"h2\">Considerations for adults</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The vast majority of experience with HCT for thalassemia is with children. However, adults have been treated with HCT, some with good outcomes.</p><p>In the 2016 report from the EBMT group, adults constituted 9 percent (133 of 1493) of thalassemia HCT recipients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-transfusion-dependent-thalassemia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The median age was 22.9 years (range, 18 to 45 years). At two years of follow-up, adults who received an HLA-identical sibling donor HCT had an overall survival of 80 percent and a thalassemia-free survival of 76 percent.</p><p>As with children, prevention of organ toxicity from iron overload is likely to be a key predictor of good outcomes, although this has not been demonstrated in clinical trials. At the time of this analysis, all adults were not regularly receiving chelation therapy and had already developed significant organ injury before regular chelation was initiated, blunting the benefits of iron removal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-transfusion-dependent-thalassemia/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2281453801\"><span class=\"h2\">Alpha thalassemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Severe alpha thalassemia presents in utero and many patients do not survive until birth due to severe hydrops fetalis.

These donors are identified from donor registries or umbilical cord blood registries. In many cases, ethnic groups with a high incidence of thalassemia tend to be underrepresented in these registries; however, a number of studies have demonstrated good outcomes with MUD transplantation for thalassemia, and experience continues to expand. A typical donor search takes approximately two to four months, and approximately one-third of patients are able to identify a MUD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-transfusion-dependent-thalassemia/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Although the tested HLA loci from a MUD may appear to be identical to the recipient, a MUD is likely to have antigenic differences that are not detectable by standard testing but are immunologically important.

As with other benign hematologic conditions for which HCT is used, outcomes are generally better using HSCs from bone marrow or umbilical cord blood rather than peripheral blood, likely due to the lower risk of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). This is because the HSC product from peripheral blood is enriched in T lymphocytes, which are responsible for GVHD. This effect is tied to a graft-versus-leukemia effect that is beneficial for malignant diseases but not necessary in thalassemia (or other non-malignant disorders).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4172354111\"><span class=\"h2\">Bone marrow versus peripheral blood</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of transplant centers use HSCs derived from bone marrow (or umbilical cord blood) rather than peripheral blood; the major rationale is to reduce the risk of chronic GVHD; improved overall survival has been noted in some studies but not others, and major differences in graft failure have not been demonstrated. For patients who undergo HCT for thalassemia, we suggest bone marrow or umbilical cord blood rather than peripheral blood as a stem cell source. This approach is consistent with advice from a 2014 expert panel guideline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-transfusion-dependent-thalassemia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Some individuals may use HSCs from peripheral blood in the setting of a clinical trial or if the donor refuses to (or is unable to) donate bone marrow, and it is possible that future changes in conditioning regimens or in GVHD prophylaxis may reduce rates of GVHD.</p><p>The lower rate of chronic GVHD with bone marrow stem cells has been demonstrated in several nonrandomized studies involving patients with thalassemia. As an example, in a 2007 study involving 87 children with class I to II disease who underwent matched sibling donor transplant using bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells, grade II to IV acute GVHD was seen in 55 versus 97 percent and chronic GVHD was seen in 19 versus 48 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-transfusion-dependent-thalassemia/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. There was no difference in the two-year overall survival (89 and 83 percent, respectively) or two-year disease-free survival (76 percent in both groups). In a 2010 study involving 52 children with class III disease who underwent matched sibling donor transplant, chronic GVHD occurred in 40 percent of those who received peripheral blood stem cells and 16 percent of those who received bone marrow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-transfusion-dependent-thalassemia/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. There were no differences in overall survival, thalassemia-free survival, or graft failure. As described above, a 2016 retrospective series from the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (EBMT) found a better two-year survival with bone marrow than with peripheral blood as the source of HSCs (90 versus 81 percent), which correlated with lower rates of acute GVHD (3 versus 8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-transfusion-dependent-thalassemia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

However, there were more treatment toxicities in the standard group, including hemorrhagic cystitis and sepsis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2691566773\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonmyeloablative conditioning regimens</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonmyeloablative HCT conditioning regimens have been developed with the hope that engraftment may be possible with less transplant-associated morbidity and mortality. These regimens also appear to be highly effective in inducing stable chimerism (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thalassemia-management-after-hematopoietic-cell-transplantation#H1411122622\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thalassemia: Management after hematopoietic cell transplantation&quot;, section on 'Mixed chimerism'</a>) with full donor erythropoiesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-for-transfusion-dependent-thalassemia/abstract/2,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,57</a>]. Despite these advances, it is important to note that nonmyeloablative regimens have not been compared with myeloablative regimens in a randomized trial, and concerns remain about greater risk of thalassemia recurrence with reduced-intensity regimens. Since patients with thalassemia are often heavily transfused and do not receive prior therapy, the barrier to engraftment is higher and graft failure is a major concern with the use of less intensive preparative regimens.

HCT outcomes are best for individuals who have undergone rigorous medical therapy with transfusions and iron chelation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F113752\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113752 \">figure 1</a>). Other predictors of good outcomes include younger age, use of a matched sibling donor, and use of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) from umbilical cord blood or bone marrow rather than peripheral blood. The Pesaro system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F67387\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67387 \">table 3</a>) is used to assign a risk class based on iron overload. (See <a href=\"#H801575\" class=\"local\">'Indications and predictors of a good outcome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ideal candidate for allogeneic HCT is a child under 14 years of age who has been treated with regular transfusions and chelation and who has a human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sibling donor; such a patient has a more than 90 percent likelihood of cure and a 4 percent risk of transplant-related mortality. For such patients, we suggest HCT rather than lifelong medical therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). HCT may also be appropriate in other settings (eg, older children or adults, HLA-matched unrelated donor (MUD), less than optimal chelation). Medical therapy is an option for individuals who wish to avoid the risks and burdens of HCT or who do not have a suitable donor. HCT and medical therapy differ substantially in their risks and burdens and have not been compared in a randomized trial, and patient and family preferences play a substantial role in decision making. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-prognosis-of-the-thalassemias#H3879790468\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and prognosis of the thalassemias&quot;, section on 'Decision to pursue allogeneic HCT'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The main purpose of the pretransplant evaluation is assessment of the patient's transplant-associated risk due to organ damage from excess iron stores. Sperm banking may be appropriate for postpubertal boys, and, in some cases, oocyte preservation may be possible for girls. (See <a href=\"#H2705119581\" class=\"local\">'Pretransplant evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An HLA-identical sibling without thalassemia is the ideal HCT donor. For those who do not have an HLA-matched sibling, a MUD can often be identified from a donor registry. Alternative donor options including umbilical cord blood from an unrelated donor and haploidentical transplant are considered investigational but may be appropriate in some cases (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F64890\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64890 \">table 5</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1798260812\" class=\"local\">'Donor selection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who undergo HCT for thalassemia, we suggest bone marrow rather than peripheral blood as a stem cell source (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The major rationale is to reduce the risk of chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). However, some individuals may use HSCs from peripheral blood. Umbilical cord blood from an HLA-matched sibling appears to have a lower risk of GVHD than peripheral blood, but it must be obtained and banked at the time of delivery. (See <a href=\"#H2777128585\" class=\"local\">'Stem cell source'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Standard myeloablative conditioning regimens use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=busulfan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">busulfan</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fludarabine</a>.
