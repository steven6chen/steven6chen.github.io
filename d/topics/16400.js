Sometimes that's the only symptom you have. Other times, you can have other symptoms such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Burning in your chest known as heartburn</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Burping</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bloating (feeling as though your belly is filled with air)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling full too quickly when you start eating</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H463226522\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse about my stomach ache?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people do not need to see a doctor or nurse for a stomach ache. But you should see your doctor or nurse if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have bloody bowel movements, diarrhea, or vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your pain is severe and lasts more than an hour or comes and goes for more than 24 hours</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You cannot eat or drink for hours</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have a fever higher than 102&deg;F (39&deg;C)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You lose a lot of weight without trying to, or lose interest in food</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H463226529\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes stomach aches?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In some cases, stomach aches are caused by a specific problem, such as a stomach ulcer (a sore on the inside of the stomach) or a condition called &quot;diverticulitis,&quot; in which small pouches in your large intestine get infected. But in <strong>some</strong> cases, doctors and nurses do not know what causes stomach aches or the other symptoms that happen with them. Even so, doctors and nurses can usually treat the symptoms of stomach ache.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H463226536\"><span class=\"h1\">What treatments help with stomach symptoms?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your symptoms are caused by a specific problem, such as an ulcer, treatments for that problem will likely relieve your symptoms. But if your doctor or nurse does not know what is causing your pain, he or she might recommend medicines that reduce the amount of acid in your stomach. These medicines often relieve stomach ache and the symptoms that come with it. Some of these medicines are available without a prescription.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H463226543\"><span class=\"h1\">Can I do anything on my own to prevent stomach ache?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes, the foods you eat and the way you eat them can have a big effect on whether or not you feel pain.</p><p>To lower your chances of getting a stomach ache:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid fatty foods, such as red meat, butter, fried foods, and cheese</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eat a bunch of small meals each day, rather than two or three big meals</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stay away from foods that seem to make your symptoms worse</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid taking over-the-counter medicines that seem to make your symptoms worse &ndash; Examples include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin).</p><p/><p>Some people &ndash; especially kids &ndash; sometimes get a stomach ache after drinking milk or eating cheese, ice cream, or other foods that have milk in them. They have a problem called &quot;lactose intolerance,&quot; which means that they cannot fully break down foods that have milk in them.</p><p>People with lactose intolerance can avoid problems caused by milk if they take a medicine called lactase. Lactase (sample brand name: Lactaid), helps your body break down milk. Some foods come with it already added.</p><p>If your stomach ache seems to be related to constipation, meaning that you do not have enough bowel movements, you might need more fiber or a medicine called a laxative. (Laxatives are medicines that increase the number of bowel movements you have.)</p><p>Taking in a lot of fiber helps to increase the number of bowel movements you have. You can get more fiber by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eating plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Taking fiber pills, powders, or wafers</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H463226550\"><span class=\"h1\">Is a stomach ache the same for children as it is for adults?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, yes. Children get stomach aches for the same reasons that adults do. As with adults, doctors and nurses often do not know what causes stomach pain in children. But in children, stomach pain is often triggered by stress or anxiety. For them, it's especially important to pay attention to psychological or emotional problems that might be making pain worse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H463226641\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=constipation-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Constipation in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=constipation-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Constipation in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diarrhea-in-adolescents-and-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Diarrhea in adolescents and adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diarrhea-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Diarrhea in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diverticulitis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Diverticulitis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ulcerative-colitis-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Ulcerative colitis in children (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=upset-stomach-functional-dyspepsia-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Upset stomach (functional dyspepsia) in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Chronic abdominal pain in children and adolescents (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
