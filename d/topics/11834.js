This is an important clinical problem, as it is estimated that about 5 to 10 percent of patients with coronary stents undergo noncardiac surgery within one year of stent implantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noncardiac-surgery-after-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>].</p><p>This topic will focus on the approach to patients scheduled to undergo elective noncardiac surgery after PCI with stenting and who are taking dual antiplatelet therapy.

Most studies that have evaluated this issue have included patients scheduled to undergo peripheral arterial, orthopedic, abdominal, or thoracic surgery, or radical prostatectomy, nephrectomy, or cystectomy.</p><p>Dual antiplatelet therapy refers to the combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> plus a P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor blocker such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prasugrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prasugrel</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ticagrelor-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ticagrelor</a>. </p><p>Adverse perioperative outcomes include acute coronary syndromes (including myocardial infarction), death, urgent revascularization, and bleeding.

Perioperative bleeding associated with the continuation of DAPT is also associated with an increased risk of perioperative cardiac events. </p><p>Observational studies suggest that patients who have undergone noncardiac surgery within six weeks after stenting may have an increased risk of death or MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noncardiac-surgery-after-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. These events are often due to stent thrombosis, which may be caused by the premature discontinuation or reduction of antiplatelet therapy, the thrombotic risk associated with many forms of major surgery, or an interaction between the two. Stent thrombosis can lead to high rates of myocardial infarction percent (50 to 70 percent) and death (10 to 40 percent), both of which are included as components of composite outcomes in the studies discussed below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noncardiac-surgery-after-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

Of note, patients with surgery followed by death as the only MACE event were excluded. Given multiple issues with confounding, we do not believe these data are compelling enough to suggest it is safe to discontinue all antiplatelet therapy prior to surgery.

In such patients, it may be necessary to stop one or both antiplatelet agents prior to our recommended duration of such therapy (one year) or even prior to the <strong>minimum </strong>required duration of treatment with dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) for the general population, which is at least six months after bare meatal and drug-eluting (DES). In patients at high bleeding risk who have received a bare metal stent, we sometimes shorten the duration of DAPT to as few as four weeks. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=long-term-antiplatelet-therapy-after-coronary-artery-stenting-in-stable-patients#H1840123222\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Long-term antiplatelet therapy after coronary artery stenting in stable patients&quot;, section on 'Summary and recommendations'</a>.) &#160; &#160;</p><p>We believe that our recommendations (below) for the management of these patients who need non-emergent noncardiac surgery are based on low-quality evidence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noncardiac-surgery-after-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. These recommendations are based on observations presented above regarding the rates of stent thrombosis in patients with premature cessation of DAPT and rates of adverse cardiovascular events found in studies of patients undergoing noncardiac surgery (see <a href=\"#H109480018\" class=\"local\">'Timing, incidence, and clinical predictors'</a> above). No randomized trials comparing different times for surgery after PCI or differing antiplatelet strategies have been performed. These recommendations attempt to take into account what is known about the risk of perioperative bleeding on one or two antiplatelet agents. </p><p>The use of DAPT should be made on a case-by-case basis, taking into account the relative benefits and risks of continuing such therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noncardiac-surgery-after-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Prior to surgery, the patient, primary care physician, cardiologist, anesthesiologist, and surgeon should be involved in decision making. </p><p>An occasional patient may be scheduled for both non-emergent noncardiac surgery and PCI. It is critically important for all managing physicians to discuss the optimal timing of each procedure. Prior to a decision for PCI and selection of PCI strategy, the timing and need for noncardiac surgery should be considered. Given the balanced risks of discontinuation of DAPT and proceeding with surgery despite DAPT, the first critical decision is the absolute need for PCI. As in other situations, a decision for appropriate PCI should be based on evidence of clinically significant ischemia and size of the territory at risk and not on angiographic findings alone. Once this decision is made, consideration should be given to timing of surgery. (See <a href=\"#H109480018\" class=\"local\">'Timing, incidence, and clinical predictors'</a> above.) </p><p>In cases where PCI cannot be deferred and noncardiac surgery is urgent (&lt;30 days), POBA may be reasonable to avoid risk of stent thrombosis or absolute requirement for DAPT, as long as a successful result is obtained. When stenting is required prior to urgent noncardiac surgery for which discontinuation of P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor blocker is likely, some of our experts prefer BMS based on reports above of higher risk for MACE for DES within six weeks. However, some experts prefer DES based on studies showing safety of reduced DAPT duration with second-generation DES and otherwise superior outcomes of DES versus BMS among patients not undergoing noncardiac surgery. If surgery can be delayed at least six weeks, most of our experts prefer DES [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noncardiac-surgery-after-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Recommendations for minimum DAPT prior to noncardiac surgery according to stent type or after POBA are included in the sections below. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H350963808\"><span class=\"h2\">Non-emergent noncardiac surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients who have undergone previous stenting with either BMS or DES and who will need cessation of one or both antiplatelet agents, we defer planned non-emergent noncardiac surgery until after the recommended duration of DAPT, which is six months for BMS and DES. The risks of noncardiac surgery before six months are increased after both BMS and DES. </p><p>For patients whose surgery cannot wait and where the risks of delaying surgery outweigh that of stent thrombosis, our recommended <strong>minimal</strong> duration of DAPT is three months for both BMS and DES [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noncardiac-surgery-after-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. This is based in part on evidence suggesting that the increased risk of MI and cardiac death is highest within the first month after stent placement and no clear difference in risk between BMS and DES [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noncardiac-surgery-after-percutaneous-coronary-intervention/abstract/30,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,32</a>]. In patients for whom surgery before three months is in their best interest after weighing risks and benefits, we sometimes refer patients as early as one month after stent placement.</p><p>The proinflammatory and prothrombotic risks of surgery may increase the baseline risk of stent thrombosis even in the presence of DAPT and regardless of stent type during this early period after stenting. We believe this risk to be higher prior to the minimum duration of DAPT recommended above, but the final decision to continue or discontinue antiplatelet therapy in the perioperative period should be made only after an informed discussion among the surgeon, managing cardiologist (and other health care providers), and the patient has taken place. Some surgeons are not fully aware of the risk of prematurely discontinuing antiplatelet therapy in patients with recent PCI with stenting. In many cases, DAPT can be continued in the perioperative period, although for some surgeries such as neurosurgery, posterior eye surgery, or prostatic surgery, the risk of major bleeding may be greater than the risk of stent thrombosis.</p><p>In these patients who undergo noncardiac surgery before the recommended minimum duration of DAPT, a platelet P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor blocker should be discontinued for as brief a period as possible. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Aspirin</a> should be continued through the perioperative period, since the risk of stent thrombosis is further increased with the cessation of both aspirin and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a> and surgery can generally usually be safely performed on aspirin. The rationale to continue aspirin comes in part from the POISE-2 trial, which is discussed separately. However, as many neurosurgical patients, for whom bleeding might be life threatening or lead to severe adverse outcomes, were not enrolled in POISE-2, the optimal strategy is not known.

Cessation of DAPT prior to the recommended duration of its use, as well as the prothrombotic and proinflammatory state associated with surgery, contribute to an increased risk of adverse cardiovascular events such as stent thrombosis, myocardial infarction, or death. On the other hand, for some patients such as those undergoing neurosurgical procedures, the risk of bleeding attributable to DAPT may be greater than the risk of an adverse cardiovascular event off such therapy. (See <a href=\"#H350961393\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H350963235\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The following are our recommendations for patients receiving DAPT after PCI with stenting for whom non-emergent noncardiac surgery is needed. The rationale for the durations presented below is given above (see <a href=\"#H350963808\" class=\"local\">'Non-emergent noncardiac surgery'</a> above): </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We recommend deferring non-emergent noncardiac surgery for at least six months, as opposed to a shorter time period, irrespective of stent type (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In patients who must undergo non-emergent (time sensitive) noncardiac surgery prior to six months, we suggest an attempt to defer surgery for at least three months after bare metal or drug-eluting stent placement (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). &#160;<br/><br/>In patients for whom surgery before three months is in their best interest after weighing risks and benefits, we sometimes refer patients as early as one month after stent placement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For most patients undergoing noncardiac surgery who are taking DAPT after PCI with stenting because they have not reached the recommended minimum duration of such therapy, we suggest continuing DAPT, as opposed to stopping it prior to surgery (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). <br/><br/>In patients for whom the risk of bleeding is likely to exceed the risk of a perioperative event due to the premature cessation of DAPT, we attempt to continue <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> alone. In patients for whom a bleeding complication could be catastrophic, such as patients undergoing neurosurgical, prostate, or posterior eye procedures, stopping both antiplatelet agents might be reasonable.
