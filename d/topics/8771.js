Although uncommon, there is evidence that the incidence of these tumors has been rising for as much as fifty years. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-pathologic-diagnosis-of-gliomas#H261416033\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and pathologic diagnosis of gliomas&quot;, section on 'Histopathologic and molecular classification'</a>.)</p><p>The incidence of primary malignant and benign brain tumors will be reviewed here. Risk factors for the development of brain tumors as well as the incidence of brain metastases are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-brain-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for brain tumors&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-brain-metastases\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of brain metastases&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">SOURCES OF DATA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Central Brain Tumor Registry of the United States (CBTRUS) includes both benign and malignant lesions in its data collection. The CBTRUS was established in 1992 and compiles information from twelve state cancer registries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incidence-of-primary-brain-tumors/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Earlier data from the SEER program and other US cancer registries were limited to malignant brain tumors; however, as of 2004, data on nonmalignant brain tumors have been systematically collected by US cancer registries after the passage of Public Law 107-260, the Benign Brain Tumor Cancer Registries Amendment Act [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incidence-of-primary-brain-tumors/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>Inclusion of benign lesions is important to properly evaluate differences in etiology and to assess the potential impact of intervention studies. Benign lesions often produce the same neurologic symptoms as malignant tumors and distinguishing between benign and malignant based upon clinical grounds can be difficult. In addition, both benign and malignant lesions are frequently treated similarly with either surgical intervention or radiation therapy, and many malignant brain tumors probably originate from benign precursors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-pathologic-diagnosis-of-gliomas#H261416033\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and pathologic diagnosis of gliomas&quot;, section on 'Histopathologic and molecular classification'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE AND MORTALITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The United States incidence rate for primary brain and nervous system tumors in adults (aged 20 years or older) is estimated to be 28.6 per 100,000 persons (data from 51 cancer registries, 2008 to 2012) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incidence-of-primary-brain-tumors/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Approximately one-third of tumors are malignant and the remainder are benign or borderline malignant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incidence-of-primary-brain-tumors/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. </p><p>The incidence rate for children (aged 0 to 19 years) is much lower (5.6 per 100,000 children) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incidence-of-primary-brain-tumors/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], although a higher percentage of primary brain tumors are malignant in children compared with adults (65 versus 33 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incidence-of-primary-brain-tumors/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Mortality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although brain tumors account for only 2 percent of all cancers, these neoplasms result in a disproportionate share of cancer morbidity and mortality. The annual age-adjusted mortality rate for primary malignant brain and CNS tumors in the United States (2008 to 2012) was 5.8 per 100,000 population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incidence-of-primary-brain-tumors/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Including all ages and all races, the approximate five-year survival rate for malignant brain tumors is 34 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incidence-of-primary-brain-tumors/abstract/3,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5</a>]. The five-year survival rates for the most common histologic subtypes, anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma, are 28 percent and 5 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incidence-of-primary-brain-tumors/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>For all histologic types, pediatric and young adult populations have a better survival than do older adults. As an example, for all primary malignant brain tumors combined, the five year survival rate among children under age 14 is 62 percent, compared with 5 percent in adults 65 years of age and older [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incidence-of-primary-brain-tumors/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Overall survival in patients with malignant brain tumors has not improved significantly over the last fifty years. However, survival rates vary according to age and histologic type. As an example, there were modest gains in survival between 1975 and 1995 for those younger than 65, but not older individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incidence-of-primary-brain-tumors/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Although little progress has been made in survival from glioblastoma in the last thirty years, five-year survival rates for medulloblastoma increased by 20 percent from the 1970s to the 1980s, although data suggest a leveling off of survival rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incidence-of-primary-brain-tumors/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>In general, young age, high performance status, and lower pathologic grade are favorable prognostic factors for primary brain tumors. Less significant predictors of favorable prognosis include long duration of symptoms, absence of mental changes at time of diagnosis, cerebellar location of tumor, small preoperative tumor size, and completeness of surgical resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incidence-of-primary-brain-tumors/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Gender</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is a slight male predominance in the incidence of malignant brain tumors. However, when both malignant and benign tumor types are examined, males account for less than one-half of all cases (42 versus 58 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incidence-of-primary-brain-tumors/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This difference is primarily explained by the higher incidence of meningiomas in women (10.6 versus 5.7 per 100,000 person-years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incidence-of-primary-brain-tumors/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Race</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Whites have a higher incidence of primary brain tumors compared with blacks across most histologies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incidence-of-primary-brain-tumors/abstract/3,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5</a>]. Exceptions include meningioma, tumors of the pituitary, and craniopharyngioma, where rates for blacks significantly exceed those observed in whites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incidence-of-primary-brain-tumors/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In general, malignant brain tumors are less common among <span class=\"nowrap\">Asian/Pacific</span> Islanders and American <span class=\"nowrap\">Indian/Alaskan</span> Natives [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incidence-of-primary-brain-tumors/abstract/3,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,9</a>], while the incidence of malignant brain tumors in Hispanics is intermediate between that in whites or African Americans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incidence-of-primary-brain-tumors/abstract/3,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of brain tumors varies with age and histology (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F72275\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72275 \">figure 1</a>). Data compiled from several tumor registries suggest a peak incidence of all primary brain tumors around age 50, although autopsy series suggest that incidence rises continuously with increasing age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incidence-of-primary-brain-tumors/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Similarly, data from CBTRUS indicate that the incidence of the most common primary malignant brain tumor in adults, glioblastoma, increases with increasing age and is highest in 75 to 84 year olds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incidence-of-primary-brain-tumors/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Most intracranial tumors occur in people older than 45 years of age. Glioblastoma rarely occurs before the age of 15 but dramatically increases after the age of 45. In contrast, medulloblastoma and other embryonal tumors are uncommon after the age of 20 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incidence-of-primary-brain-tumors/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Adults</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In adults, gliomas (principally astrocytoma) account for approximately 30 percent and meningioma 35 to 40 percent of symptomatic primary brain tumors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F81566\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81566 \">table 1</a>). The incidence of meningioma is likely higher when neuroimaging studies are included because of the large number of asymptomatic tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incidence-of-primary-brain-tumors/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Pituitary tumors account for 15 to 20 percent, primary central nervous system lymphoma for 2 to 3 percent, and craniopharyngioma for 1 percent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Children</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In children and adolescents up to the age of 19 years, brain tumors are the most common solid malignancy and the second leading cause of cancer death after leukemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incidence-of-primary-brain-tumors/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Brain tumor incidence rates are approximately 5.8 per 100,000 per year and the male-to-female ratio is approximately equal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incidence-of-primary-brain-tumors/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The different histologic subtypes of neuroepithelial brain tumors seen in children and their relative frequency are shown in the following table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F67876\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67876 \">table 2</a>). The most common include low-grade astrocytoma, medulloblastoma, and high-grade glioma (anaplastic gliomas and glioblastoma).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Temporal trends</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiple studies have documented rising incidence rates for brain tumors in several industrialized countries; this increase seems to be confined mainly to the elderly population, with no clear ethnic, gender or geographic differences. The incidence in whites rose 80 percent from 1950 to 1994 and 18 percent from 1973 to 1994 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incidence-of-primary-brain-tumors/abstract/5,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,14,15</a>].</p><p>The increases observed in the United States were present in all age strata and racial groups, similar to findings in other parts of the world [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incidence-of-primary-brain-tumors/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. There is limited epidemiological evidence from a longitudinally studied population in Rochester, Minnesota suggesting that a rise in brain tumor mortality may have been evident since the 1940s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incidence-of-primary-brain-tumors/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>The precise etiology of this increase in brain tumor incidence remains unclear. There is agreement that at least part of this increase is the result of more complete case ascertainment with improved diagnostic technology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incidence-of-primary-brain-tumors/abstract/11,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,18</a>].</p><p>However, improved diagnostic capability cannot fully account for the magnitude of the observed increase in brain tumor incidence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incidence-of-primary-brain-tumors/abstract/9,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,18</a>]. These data, in conjunction with the evidence suggesting the increase may have been occurring for many decades, leave open the possibility that an environmental exposure may account for part of the increasing incidence of brain tumors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-brain-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for brain tumors&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">International trends and migrant studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Increasing incidence rates of brain tumors have been observed in many other countries of the world over the last thirty years. The highest incidence rates are noted in industrialized nations such as the United States, Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom, while developing nations have lower rates. In general, the brain cancer incidence appears to be associated with the level of economic development; differences in the availability of diagnostic methodology (CT, MRI, neurosurgical technology) may account for some of the observed disparities.</p><p>Despite sparse data from developing countries, it appears that most migrants acquire the brain cancer incidence rates of their host country. For most migrant studies, the host country had elevated incidence rates compared to the country of origin, with migrants developing increases in brain cancer incidence and mortality. This observation suggests that environmental factors may influence the development of brain cancer. However, these studies were complicated by disparities in case ascertainment in the countries under study.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Primary central nervous system lymphoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There was an overall increase in the incidence of primary central nervous system lymphoma from the 1960s to the 1990s, which has been attributed at least in part to an increased frequency of these tumors in immunocompromised populations. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-primary-central-nervous-system-lymphoma#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, pathologic features, and diagnosis of primary central nervous system lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p>Benign tumors can produce substantial morbidity and can occasionally be fatal.
