For the 15 to 20 percent of patients with breast cancer whose tumors overexpress HER2, trastuzumab therapy is important in the treatment of both early and advanced disease. Its use, however, results in a small to modest risk for cardiotoxicity, which is typically manifested by an asymptomatic decrease in left ventricular ejection fraction and less often by clinical heart failure.
