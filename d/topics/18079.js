In patients with the Ebstein and valvular subtypes, the surgical approach entails excision of the malformed valve and prosthetic valve replacement, whereas in the other variants, surgical management consists of palliative interventions including the Fontan procedure.

It is thought that most cases of TV atresia (muscular, membranous, and valvular subtypes) are derived from a similar disruption of normal development of the atrioventricular valves from the endocardial cushions and delamination of the ventricular myocardium. (See <a href=\"#H35219280\" class=\"local\">'Morphology of TV atresia'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H533562809\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In some cases, an underlying genetic defect may contribute to the disruption of the normal development of the TV. Although no specific gene defect has been identified, supporting evidence for a genetic contribution includes the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Studies in mice with TV atresia have identified mutations in the <em>FOG2</em> gene (also referred to as <em>ZFPM2</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricuspid-valve-tv-atresia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

This obligate right-to-left atrial shunting is necessary for survival, as it allows deoxygenated systemic venous blood to enter the left atrium (LA) and subsequently, the left ventricle (LV). As a result of the mixing of systemic and pulmonary venous blood in the LA, some level of cyanosis is always present (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F88605\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef88605 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Pulmonary blood flow in patients with TV atresia depends on the anatomy of the great arteries and the presence and size of a ventricular septal defect (VSD) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F88531\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88531 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F88605\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef88605 \">figure 1</a>).

A patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is the only source of pulmonary blood flow. Systemic blood flow is derived directly from the LV.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In patients with a VSD (subtypes Ib and Ic), the left-to-right flow of blood from the LV to RV across the VSD is the source of pulmonary blood flow. The size of the VSD and the degree of pulmonary stenosis dictate the amount of pulmonary blood flow, which in turn can manifest as pulmonary overcirculation (excessive pulmonary blood flow) or cyanosis (restrictive pulmonary blood flow). In some patients with restricted blood flow, a PDA is critical for survival. Systemic blood flow is derived directly from the LV.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with type II TV atresia with transposed great arteries, pulmonary blood flow is derived directly from the LV and systemic blood flow from the RV. In these patients, a VSD is critical, as the RV, which provides the systemic circulation through the aorta, is dependent on blood flowing from the LV through the VSD. The presence of a restrictive or closing VSD <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> RV infundibular narrowing results in obstruction of systemic blood flow. If the obstruction is critical (severe), this results in diminished systemic circulation leading to hypotension and, possibly, cardiogenic shock. In these patients, a PDA is critical for survival.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H35220112\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H533562824\"><span class=\"h2\">Fetal presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Advances in ultrasound technology have enabled antenatal screening between 18 and 22 weeks gestation to accurately make the diagnosis of TV atresia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F88609\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef88609 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricuspid-valve-tv-atresia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. TV atresia is compatible with fetal survival, but there are significant changes in fetal heart circulation. In the normal fetal heart, the right ventricle (RV) is the dominant ventricle with distribution of about 65 percent of the combined cardiac output, whereas the left ventricle (LV) distributes 35 percent of the output, which has entered the left atrium (LA) through the foramen ovale (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F66765\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66765 \">figure 2</a>). The blood flow in the patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is normally right-to-left from the RV to the descending aorta. In contrast, in fetuses with TV atresia, the LV assumes a dominant role as all of the systemic venous return crosses the foramen ovale from the right atrium (RA) to LA, and subsequently the LV (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F88820\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef88820 \">figure 3</a>). The presence of reverse (left-to-right flow) blood flow in the PDA suggests inadequate pulmonary outflow, which in turn indicates the need for postnatal initiation of prostaglandin therapy to maintain ductal patency required for adequate pulmonary blood flow and for survival. (See <a href=\"#H533562863\" class=\"local\">'Initial medical management'</a> below.)</p><p>In two case series of prenatally diagnosed TV atresia, about 4 percent of cases resulted in intrauterine death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricuspid-valve-tv-atresia/abstract/16,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,18</a>]. In both cohorts, the cause of death could not be ascertained, but a restrictive atrial level communication resulting in fetal hydrops was suggested as a cause for intrauterine demise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricuspid-valve-tv-atresia/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. There was also a significant rate of elective termination including 25 of 88 pregnancies in one study (28 percent), and 17 of 54 in the other (32 percent).</p><p>In one of the above studies, extracardiac anomalies were observed in 12 of the 54 cases; five with chromosomal anomalies, two with VACTERL association (vertebral anomaly, anal atresia, cardiac defect, tracheoesophageal fistula, and renal and limb abnormalities), and one fetus each with unilateral renal agenesis, hypospadia, hydrothorax, megacystis, and agenesis of the ductus venosus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricuspid-valve-tv-atresia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In addition, other case reports have observed increased nuchal thickness with normal karyotype in fetuses with TV atresia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricuspid-valve-tv-atresia/abstract/17,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H533562832\"><span class=\"h2\">Postnatal presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 50 percent of patients who present postnatally with TV atresia do so on the first day of life, while an additional 30 percent present by one month of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricuspid-valve-tv-atresia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The typical presenting symptoms are cyanosis and a heart murmur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricuspid-valve-tv-atresia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The clinical course and manifestations vary depending on the presence of other associated cardiac lesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F88531\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88531 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H35219287\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pulmonary atresia</strong> &ndash; In patients with tricuspid and pulmonary valve atresia (types Ia and IIa), pulmonary blood flow is derived exclusively from a PDA. As the PDA closes in response to increasing arterial oxygen levels, these infants develop hypoxemia and acidosis. Closure of the PDA can be prevented with the initiation of prostaglandin therapy. (See <a href=\"#H533562863\" class=\"local\">'Initial medical management'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ventricular septal defect (VSD) and normally related great arteries</strong> &ndash; In patients with normal anatomy of the great arteries and VSD (types Ib and Ic), the following spectrum of clinical manifestations are observed:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In the absence of restricted pulmonary blood flow with a large VSD and no pulmonary stenosis, pulmonary blood flow increases in the first few weeks of life as the pulmonary vascular resistance drops. Symptoms of pulmonary overcirculation and heart failure are seen within two to three weeks after birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricuspid-valve-tv-atresia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Patients with inadequate pulmonary blood flow will need initial management with prostaglandin infusion to maintain patency of a PDA to ensure adequate pulmonary blood flow.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Because patients with TV atresia generally have a muscular VSD and the natural history of muscular VSD is to decrease in size over time, these patients may have episodes of hypoxic spells with increasing restriction of pulmonary blood flow as there is a decrease in the left-to-right shunting of blood through the shrinking VSD.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Transposition of the great vessels</strong> &ndash; In patients with D-transposition of the great arteries (D-TGA) (type II), the aorta arises from the hypoplastic RV. Since there is mixing of systemic and pulmonary circulations through an atrial level communication, postnatal circulation is similar to fetal circulation. As a result, patients present with cyanosis or decreased oxygen saturation. These patients may develop symptoms of pulmonary overcirculation (eg, tachypnea, increased work of breathing). However, in patients with aortic arch hypoplasia, coarctation may develop as the PDA closes because of constriction of ductal tissue in the affected region of the aorta. As a result, maintenance of ductal patency may be required to preserve flow into the aorta.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H533562840\"><span class=\"h3\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Central cyanosis is generally the most notable feature on physical examination.

As is true for most univentricular conditions such as hypoplastic left heart syndrome, the surgical management of TV atresia consists of three staged palliative procedures typically performed at the following ages:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>First stage is performed in neonates</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Second stage (eg, Glenn procedure) is usually performed at three to six months of age</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Third stage (eg, Fontan procedure) is usually performed at two to three years of age</p><p/><p>In most institutions including our own center, the Glenn and Fontan operations are performed as two stages to allow the body to adapt to the different hemodynamic states and reduce overall surgical morbidity and mortality.

The goals of the initial palliation are to ensure that blood exiting the right atrium (RA) is unimpeded, provides adequate pulmonary blood flow, protects the pulmonary artery bed from high pressures that could result in higher risk for subsequent operations, and ensures unobstructed flow from the left ventricle (LV) to the aorta. Choices for intervention are dependent on the anatomic variants as follows (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F88531\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88531 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TV atresia with normally related great arteries (type I):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>With diminished pulmonary blood flow, the initial surgery soon after birth aims to restore a reliable source of pulmonary blood flow with a modified Blalock-Taussig shunt (shunt from the innominate artery into the central pulmonary artery) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F98391\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef98391 \">figure 4</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In the presence of unobstructed pulmonary blood flow (type Ic), a pulmonary artery band may be placed in early infancy to restrict the amount of pulmonary blood flow and protect the pulmonary bed from high systemic pressures. As mentioned above, the vast majority of ventricular septal defects (VSDs) decrease in size over time and restrict pulmonary blood flow. A pulmonary artery band, therefore, may not be required in all patients who have unobstructed pulmonary flow at birth through a VSD, and could be restricted to patients who are symptomatic despite maximal medical therapy for pulmonary <span class=\"nowrap\">congestion/heart</span> failure. Furthermore, a pulmonary artery band may stimulate myocardial hypertrophy that may more rapidly reduce the size of the VSD.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Rarely, the degree of restriction to pulmonary blood flow is enough to maintain adequate oxygenation without pulmonary overcirculation and heart failure.

This stage of palliation is typically performed at three to six months of life when infants experience progressive cyanosis as they begin to outgrow their neonatal shunt. This surgery involves removal of the original shunt, and direct anastomosis of the superior vena cava to the right pulmonary artery. The Glenn procedure relies on passive venous drainage from the superior vena cava directly into the pulmonary artery. However, there is persistent systemic desaturation due to continued inferior vena cava flow into the RA. In a case series of 557 patients who underwent second stage palliation for single ventricle anatomy from 1998 to 2010, the overall mortality rate was low (4.7 percent) and there were no deaths in the 12 percent of patients who had TV atresia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricuspid-valve-tv-atresia/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

Prior to stage II and stage III, a comprehensive evaluation including echocardiography and cardiac catheterization should be undertaken to evaluate for hemodynamic and anatomic suitability. Interventions to address any residual anatomic lesions such as branch pulmonary artery stenosis, aortic coarctation, and coiling aortopulmonary collaterals can be undertaken during these catheterizations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H196352641\"><span class=\"h3\">Third stage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several variants of the Fontan procedure have been used in the final stage of palliation for TV atresia, and commonly entail direct anastomosis of the RA into the pulmonary arteries, thereby completely separating the pulmonary and systemic circulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricuspid-valve-tv-atresia/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. Subsequent modifications include the use of a lateral tunnel or an extracardiac conduit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tricuspid-valve-tv-atresia/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>] As a result of the Fontan procedure, the blood that returns to the common atrium (left) is fully oxygenated and the single LV serves as the systemic pump.

With the advance in surgical and medical management, the overall survival has improved with reported survival of 80 percent at 10 years. Long-term morbidity includes ventricular dysfunction, arrhythmia, risk of thrombosis, and complications related to lymphatic dysfunction.
