The ISRNM developed objective criteria for the definition of PEW syndrome in dialysis and chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-treatment-of-malnutrition-in-maintenance-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>This topic reviews the pathogenesis and treatment of PEW syndrome in hemodialysis patients.</p><p>The assessment of nutritional status and the effect of malnutrition on outcomes among hemodialysis patients are discussed elsewhere.

Although strong experimental data link inflammation, insulin resistance, and metabolic acidosis to protein wasting, it is unclear whether these mechanisms also lead to energy wasting. On the contrary, energy excess as manifested by adiposity is a major driver of inflammation and insulin resistance in dialysis patients. Overall, the pathogenesis of PEW syndrome is incompletely understood and likely multifactorial. There have been many proposed mechanisms, but we believe these provide an incomplete explanation for the causation of PEW syndrome. Proposed mechanisms include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Decreased intake and anorexia</strong> &ndash; Thirty-five to 50 percent of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients are reported to have anorexia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-treatment-of-malnutrition-in-maintenance-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">With progression of kidney failure, there is a spontaneous decline in protein intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-treatment-of-malnutrition-in-maintenance-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. This decline likely results from the accumulation of nitrogenous waste products and increases in enteric hormones, adipokines (leptin and visfatin), and elevated inflammatory cytokines, all of which regulate appetite [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-treatment-of-malnutrition-in-maintenance-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/18-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-22</a>]. Anorexia may be worsened by depression, which is very common in chronic kidney disease (CKD) and, particularly, dialysis patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Among hemodialysis patients, under-dialysis commonly causes anorexia and decreased taste acuity. In one study, an increase in dialysis dose from a <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> of 0.82 to 1.32 increased the protein catabolic rate (reflecting increased protein intake and better nutrition) from 0.81 to 1.02 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> per day over a three-month period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-treatment-of-malnutrition-in-maintenance-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The rise in protein catabolic rate (PCR) was likely due to improved appetite. A second group in which the dialysis regimen was unchanged had no increase in either <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> or PCR.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, an increase in dialysis beyond accepted recommended target doses does not appear to have an effect on protein intake. As an example, in the Frequent Hemodialysis Network (FHN) study, compared with conventional three times a week dialysis, more frequent dialysis did not result in an increase in protein intake as measured by equilibrated PCR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-treatment-of-malnutrition-in-maintenance-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Recommendations regarding dialysis dose are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prescribing-and-assessing-adequate-hemodialysis#H794161203\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prescribing and assessing adequate hemodialysis&quot;, section on 'Target Kt/V'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hypercatabolic state</strong> &ndash; Some patients with CKD, particularly those on dialysis, are hypercatabolic. In one study, measured resting energy expenditure (REE) among CKD patients (including 15 with advanced CKD, 15 on chronic hemodialysis, and 10 on peritoneal dialysis) was 10 to 20 percent higher than predicted values derived in normal and obese populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-treatment-of-malnutrition-in-maintenance-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. REE was higher among both peritoneal and hemodialysis patients compared with CKD patients that were not on dialysis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, not all CKD and dialysis patients are hypercatabolic. The net energy expenditure is the sum of REE plus physical activity expenditure. Many patients are sedentary, resulting in decreased physical activity expenditure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-treatment-of-malnutrition-in-maintenance-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. As a result, the body mass index (BMI) of incident hemodialysis patients has been increasing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-treatment-of-malnutrition-in-maintenance-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Inflammation and comorbidities</strong> &ndash; The presence of an acute, chronic, or occult systemic illness may adversely affect nutritional status. Chronic lung disease, congestive heart failure, and malignancy are associated with PEW syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-treatment-of-malnutrition-in-maintenance-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Acute illness also contributes to poor nutritional status; nutritional indices such as serum albumin are known to worsen after recent hospitalization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-treatment-of-malnutrition-in-maintenance-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Gastroparesis (by slowing gastric emptying) may contribute to anorexia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gastroparesis-etiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H259165942\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gastroparesis: Etiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although the mechanism by which inflammation contributes to PEW is not clear, inflammation causes increased energy expenditure. Proinflammatory cytokine levels and oxidative stress likely contribute. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inflammation-in-renal-insufficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inflammation in renal insufficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In experimental models, activation of the ubiquitination pathway by inflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha leads to proteolysis and muscle wasting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-treatment-of-malnutrition-in-maintenance-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. A marker of nutrition, serum albumin is inversely related to the inflammatory marker, C-reactive protein (CRP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-treatment-of-malnutrition-in-maintenance-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Thus, systemic inflammation could lead to protein wasting.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">It is unclear whether inflammation leads to energy wasting in dialysis patients. Indeed, despite the higher prevalence of comorbidities, higher concentrations of CRP, lower concentrations of plasma albumin, and lower muscle mass, dialysis patients have higher BMI and higher waist circumference compared with the national norms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-treatment-of-malnutrition-in-maintenance-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Furthermore, adipose tissue is a major source of inflammatory cytokines, and obesity rather than being underweight is associated with elevated CRP levels in CKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-treatment-of-malnutrition-in-maintenance-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>] and dialysis patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-treatment-of-malnutrition-in-maintenance-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Insulin resistance</strong> &ndash; Studies suggest that insulin resistance may contribute to muscle protein breakdown among hemodialysis patients with and without type 2 diabetes, although this has not been conclusively proven [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-treatment-of-malnutrition-in-maintenance-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The oral hypoglycemic agents that improve insulin action, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rosiglitazone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rosiglitazone</a>, ameliorate proteolysis in animal models of diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-treatment-of-malnutrition-in-maintenance-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, while insulin resistance could lead to protein wasting, insulin resistance is primarily caused by adiposity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-treatment-of-malnutrition-in-maintenance-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Metabolic acidosis</strong> &ndash; Animal models and clinical studies of CKD and dialysis patients suggest that metabolic acidosis may contribute to proteolysis and correction may provide benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-treatment-of-malnutrition-in-maintenance-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/39-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-43</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">As an example, in a randomized, controlled trial, peritoneal dialysis using high-lactate (40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/liter)</span> or low-lactate (35 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/liter)</span> alkali dialysate was compared among 200 incident continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-treatment-of-malnutrition-in-maintenance-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. At one year, patients undergoing high-lactate dialysis had a greater increase in body weight (6.1&plusmn;0.7 kg versus 3.7&plusmn;0.6 in patients receiving low-lactate dialysis). The midarm circumference was also higher in the high-lactate group (1.26&plusmn;0.16 cm versus 0.61&plusmn;0.16 cm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-treatment-of-malnutrition-in-maintenance-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Another randomized trial compared oral bicarbonate supplementation to standard care (ie, no supplementation) among 134 adult CKD patients with reduced creatinine clearance (15 to 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>) and metabolic acidosis (serum bicarbonate 16 to 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-treatment-of-malnutrition-in-maintenance-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. At two years, nutritional parameters improved with bicarbonate supplementation compared with standard care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-treatment-of-malnutrition-in-maintenance-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, among hemodialysis patients, serum bicarbonate and serum creatinine (an indicator of muscle mass) are inversely correlated (ie, serum bicarbonate is high in those with decreased muscle mass) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-treatment-of-malnutrition-in-maintenance-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. As the serum bicarbonate is already normal or high in those with low muscle mass, the role of bicarbonate supplementation on improving muscle mass in those with established PEW remains to be determined.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>The dialysis procedure</strong> &ndash; The dialysis procedure itself may be catabolic due to reduced protein synthesis and the loss of amino acids in dialysate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-treatment-of-malnutrition-in-maintenance-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. Amino acid losses into dialysate can average 4 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> with peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-treatment-of-malnutrition-in-maintenance-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. Among hemodialysis patients, amino acid losses may be more prominent when a bioincompatible membrane is used.

Protein loss as high as 20 grams in one hemodialysis session has been reported with polysulfone dialyzers reused with bleach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-treatment-of-malnutrition-in-maintenance-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].

Furthermore, fluid restriction to minimize intradialytic weight gain may lead to a decrease in caloric intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-treatment-of-malnutrition-in-maintenance-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Solid food has a high fluid content, and many beverages contain a substantial amount of calories.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Medications &ndash;</strong> Medications, such as phosphate binders, can impair nutrient absorption.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DIETARY RECOMMENDATIONS TO PREVENT PROTEIN-ENERGY WASTING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We agree with the National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (KDOQI) and the European Best Practice guidelines that recommend the following diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-treatment-of-malnutrition-in-maintenance-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>1.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> protein per day; at least 50 percent should be of high biologic value</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>30 to 35 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/kg</span> of calories per day</p><p/><p>The recommended protein allowance is higher than the recommended daily allowance for healthy adults (which is 0.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/day)</span>.

For most hemodialysis patients, intradialytic parenteral nutrition (IDPN) and oral supplements are equally effective. In one comparative study, 186 malnourished hemodialysis patients were randomly assigned to oral nutritional supplements, with or without one year of IDPN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-and-treatment-of-malnutrition-in-maintenance-hemodialysis-patients/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].

However, most of the patients with malnutrition resistant to both oral supplements and IDPN have an underlying terminal illness such as metastatic malignancy or advanced heart failure.

However, these supplements are more costly than less specific preparations, which often decreases compliance. Our selection of a specific agent depends on patient characteristics:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients who have no history of interdialytic hyperkalemia or volume overload (and are able to tolerate the increase in potassium and fluid intake), we use general supplements such as Ensure or Boost Nutritional Drink because of their low cost.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among patients who have a history of hyperkalemia or volume overload on dialysis (due, for example, to heart failure), we use a specific &quot;renal failure&quot; supplement, such as Novasource Renal or Nepro, which have double the calorie and protein and 30 to 35 percent less potassium and phosphorus content per mL of supplement.</p><p/><p>A different regimen is required in patients with severe anorexia who are unable to increase their oral intake.
