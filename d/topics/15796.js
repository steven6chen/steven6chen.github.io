Wakeful bruxism is a less common circadian phenotype of bruxism and probably differs etiologically from sleep-related bruxism; it is seen primarily in association with neurodevelopmental disorders such as Rett syndrome.

The magnitude of risk is not well established, nor is it clear whether these medications exacerbate preexisting bruxism or cause de novo symptoms.</p><p>Bruxism occurs with increased frequency in patients with certain neurologic and psychiatric disorders, including Down syndrome, Rett syndrome, cerebral palsy, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-bruxism-tooth-grinding/abstract/10,17-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,17-22</a>]. In many of these cases, wakeful bruxism may be more prominent than sleep-related bruxism. In others, such as ADHD, medications used to treat the disorder (eg, stimulants) may contribute to bruxism, and it is not clear whether an independent association exists. </p><p>Additional risk factors in children include other parasomnias or sleep-related behaviors (eg, sleeptalking, sleepwalking, enuresis), enlarged tonsils and adenoids, and OSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-bruxism-tooth-grinding/abstract/7,9,23-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9,23-27</a>].</p><p>Psychosocial risk factors include anxiety, stress, and competitive personality traits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-bruxism-tooth-grinding/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. Bruxism is also reported with increased frequency among individuals with temporomandibular joint disorders and gastroesophageal reflux disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-bruxism-tooth-grinding/abstract/10,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,30</a>].</p><p>Twin studies and parent-offspring studies suggest that genetics may play a role, although specific genetic risk factors have not been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-bruxism-tooth-grinding/abstract/7,31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,31-33</a>]. Twenty to fifty percent of patients with bruxism report at least one direct family member with a history of bruxism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-bruxism-tooth-grinding/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H271438556\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sleep-related bruxism is most likely a centrally-mediated phenomenon related to micro-arousals from sleep and activation of the autonomic nervous system. </p><p>Nearly all events occur during natural micro-arousals from sleep and are preceded by a predictable pattern of autonomic activity. The seconds before an event are characterized by rapid-frequency cortical electroencephalogram<strong>&nbsp;</strong>(EEG) activity, heart rate elevation, increased jaw and oropharyngeal muscle tone, and increased respiratory effort and nasal air flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-bruxism-tooth-grinding/abstract/23,28,34-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,28,34-37</a>]. This is followed by an increase in rhythmic masticatory muscle activity (RMMA) in the jaw muscles of such magnitude to produce tooth grinding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-bruxism-tooth-grinding/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Bruxism events tend to occur in clusters during a micro-arousal spanning 3 to 15 seconds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-bruxism-tooth-grinding/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. </p><p>Based on these observations, it is hypothesized that sleep-related bruxism is an exaggerated form of oromotor response to sleep micro-arousals under the influence of the brainstem reticular activating system, which contributes to increased activity in autonomic, cardiac, and motor networks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-bruxism-tooth-grinding/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

Although perceived stress and anxiety are often correlated with sleep-related bruxism in observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-bruxism-tooth-grinding/abstract/9,48-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,48-50</a>], a pathophysiologic basis for this association has not been established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-bruxism-tooth-grinding/abstract/51-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-53</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1857993198\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2646531529\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms and signs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sleep-related bruxism manifests as rhythmic, approximately one-per-second (1 Hz) contractions of the masticator muscles during sleep. Bruxism is distinguished from chewing in that both jaw closing and opening muscles are coactive, rather than serially activated. Many patients are unaware of the episodes, but parents or bed partners may complain of disturbance from the clicking or grating sound that occurs with about 20 percent of contractions.</p><p>The frequency of bruxism fluctuates from night to night and from week to week. Some patients may report that bruxism, or symptoms associated with bruxism, increase with levels of life stress and anxiety.</p><p>Extreme forms of sleep-related bruxism involve forceful rhythmical grinding or clenching of the teeth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-bruxism-tooth-grinding/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. The forces generated during these episodes can exceed those of voluntary maximum biting or chewing, and patients may develop secondary morning headaches, jaw pain, and clicking in the temporomandibular joints.</p><p>Bruxism can have detrimental effects on the teeth, including damage to teeth and dental work, thermal sensitivity in the teeth, hypermobility, and need for dental restorations. Tooth wear is seen on tooth surfaces that contact during biting or chewing. Lateral grinding forces in particular can be particularly destructive. Tooth wear alone, however, is not specific to bruxism. (See <a href=\"#H2564351055\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>In severe cases, sleep-related bruxism can lead to injury to soft tissues of the mouth (tongue, lips, cheeks), dental fractures, tooth hypermobility and changes in the bite, difficulty with chewing, muscle pain and spasm, temporomandibular joint pain and dysfunction, and head and neck pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-bruxism-tooth-grinding/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>]. The association between bruxism and chronic craniofacial pain is controversial, however, and at least one study found that patients with frequent sleep-related bruxism were less likely to complain of jaw pain and fatigue than those with infrequent bruxism episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-bruxism-tooth-grinding/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2290777978\"><span class=\"h2\">Natural history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sleep-related bruxism is most common during childhood but can begin at any age. It may be noted by parents as early as the appearance of the first primary upper and lower anterior teeth. Onset during adolescence or adulthood may be associated with risk factors such as obstructive sleep apnea or certain medications. (See <a href=\"#H984894541\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p>The natural history is not well characterized but is usually benign. Although bruxism beginning in childhood often persists into adulthood, episodes may be infrequent or remain asymptomatic for most of the lifespan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-bruxism-tooth-grinding/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Some individuals report episodic worsening of sleep-related bruxism across the lifespan in relation to perceived life stress or anxiety; however, most studies indicate that prevalence decreases linearly with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-bruxism-tooth-grinding/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H840128227\"><span class=\"h2\">Polysomnography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>On polysomnography, sleep-related bruxism is characterized by rhythmic masticatory muscle activity (RMMA) that occurs at approximately 1 Hz and is usually concomitant with a micro-arousal from sleep, typically lasting 3 to 15 seconds (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F112718\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef112718 \">waveform 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-bruxism-tooth-grinding/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Bruxism can also manifest as prolonged isotonic contraction of the masticatory muscles, which may last for several minutes at a time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-bruxism-tooth-grinding/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p>Most events occur during stages N1 and N2 of non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Occurrence during REM sleep is rare except in association with medication-induced bruxism and neurodevelopmental disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-bruxism-tooth-grinding/abstract/28,34,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,34,56</a>].</p><p>Additional surface electromyography (EMG) electrodes can be placed over the masseter and temporal muscles to increase the sensitivity of detecting bruxism episodes on polysomnography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-bruxism-tooth-grinding/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. Audio-video recordings improve specificity and help distinguish bruxism from other orofacial and head movements, such as lip sucking, rhythmic movement disorders, chewing-like movements (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F104851\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef104851 \">waveform 2</a>), swallowing, head rubbing and scratching, eye opening, and blinking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-bruxism-tooth-grinding/abstract/58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59</a>].

Importantly, overnight sleep studies are not highly sensitive for sleep-related bruxism, as episode frequency varies from night to night [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-bruxism-tooth-grinding/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].

In such cases, additional clues that tooth grinding is not simple sleep-related bruxism are typically present, including other more classical symptoms of temporal lobe seizures (eg, rising epigastric sensation, d&eacute;j&agrave; vu, altered awareness), and occurrence of events during both day and night.

Distinguishing active versus chronic or static tooth wear is also difficult.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients should be asked about risk factors for other causes of tooth wear, including chemical erosion related to dietary factors (eg, soft drinks), gastroesophageal reflux, bulimia nervosa, or xerostomia; abrasion (wear caused by chewing abrasive substances); normal age-related tooth wear; and wakeful bruxism.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other causes of jaw pain and fatigue</strong> &ndash; Although the presence of morning pain or fatigue in the jaw muscles, teeth, and temples is part of the diagnostic criteria for sleep-related bruxism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-bruxism-tooth-grinding/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], these symptoms alone are not sufficient for diagnosis.

The available data indicate that oral devices do not reduce the frequency of bruxism itself [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-bruxism-tooth-grinding/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. Anecdotally, however, many patients nonetheless find that they decrease morning jaw discomfort when used regularly, and they are fairly effective at controlling tooth wear.</p><p>Oral devices for bruxism fall into two categories: occlusal (bite) splints and mandibular advancement devices (MADs). Of these, occlusal splints are most commonly used and preferred in most cases; MADs may be less comfortable to wear than occlusal splints and are not typically used for bruxism unless there is comorbid obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-bruxism-tooth-grinding/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>].

Occlusal splints should be inspected periodically by a dental clinician, as they can wear out or become damaged with time due to ongoing bruxism. Children in a mixed dentition phase may benefit from a soft occlusal splint, which can be adapted to the dynamically changing bite.</p><p>Numerous other specialized oral devices exist; however, none of these has been shown to be effective in clinical trials, and some can induce irreversible changes in the bite. Thus, an occlusal splint is the most studied and safest device to use in virtually all cases where sleep bruxism is the sole entity being treated.</p><p>The main contraindication to occlusal splints is OSA, which can be exacerbated by splint use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-bruxism-tooth-grinding/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. An MAD or continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) are better choices in such patients, as they address apneas and may reduce associated arousals, as well as protect the teeth (for MADs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-bruxism-tooth-grinding/abstract/13,80,82-84\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,80,82-84</a>].

None of the trials found a significant decrease in electromyography (EMG)-determined bruxism episodes or improvement in patient-reported outcomes (eg, jaw pain). Clonidine (0.3 mg nightly) was associated with a trend towards benefit in the number of bruxism events per hour compared with placebo (mean difference -2.4, 95% CI -4.8 to 0.02) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sleep-related-bruxism-tooth-grinding/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>].
