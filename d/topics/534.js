These individuals may also be using other addictive or illicit substances. Both the gravida and her family benefit from factual, nonjudgmental information about the maternal and fetal risks of alcohol use and, if necessary, from counseling regarding strategies for cessation. Pregnant women are typically highly motivated to modify their behavior to help their unborn child. In one national survey from the United States, 87&nbsp;percent of women who drank alcohol before pregnancy quit drinking during&nbsp;pregnancy, 6.6&nbsp;percent reduced their alcohol intake, and about 6.4&nbsp;percent reported no reduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-intake-and-pregnancy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H450955954\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY OF ALCOHOL USE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alcohol consumption during pregnancy is common. The prevalence of alcohol consumption prior to and during pregnancy highlights the need to educate all reproductive age women about the potential harms of alcohol exposure on the developing fetus. </p><p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention surveillance system reported that, within the month prior to being interviewed, 10.2 percent of pregnant women used alcohol and 3.1 percent acknowledged binge drinking in the United States from 2011 to 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-intake-and-pregnancy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. While both prevalence rates are somewhat increased compared with the rates reported between 2006 and 2010 (7.6 and 1.4 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-intake-and-pregnancy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], the increases may reflect methodologic changes in study design rather than a true increase in alcohol use. Of note, when the time period being studied is extended, pregnant women report higher rates of alcohol use. The 2009 National Birth Defects Prevention Study of over 4000 women that asked women about drinking behavior for the entire duration of pregnancy, found that 30 percent of pregnant women reported any alcohol use and 8 percent reported binge drinking on at least one occasion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-intake-and-pregnancy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Additionally, the 2004 Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System (PRAMS) survey that assessed preconception behavior determined that 50 percent of women reported alcohol use in the three months prior to pregnancy, which placed them at risk for an alcohol-exposed conception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-intake-and-pregnancy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Demographic factors associated with alcohol use during pregnancy vary. In the 2011 to 2013 United States survey, the characteristics associated with the highest prevalence of prenatal alcohol use were age between 35 and 44 years (18.6 percent), black (non-Hispanic) race (13.9 percent), college degree (13.0 percent), and employment (12.0 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-intake-and-pregnancy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Hypotheses that may account for these findings include: (1) greater discretionary income for women who are older or have a college degree, and (2) women who attend college may have a greater acceptance of alcohol consumption and binge drinking. More studies are needed to elucidate these relationships and other potential contributors. </p><p>For binge drinking during pregnancy, the significant demographic factor in the 2011 to 2013 survey was non-married status. The prevalence of binge drinking among non-married pregnant women was 4.6 times the prevalence among married pregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-intake-and-pregnancy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The explanation for this finding is not known, but may reflect a combination of socioeconomic factors. Of additional concern from the 2011 to 2013 survey, pregnant women who binge drank reported a significantly higher frequency of binge drinking (4.6 versus 3.1 episodes) and consumed more alcohol per episode (7.5 versus 6 drinks [although this was not statistically significant]) compared with non-pregnant binge drinkers. The increased frequency and volume of binge drinking reported by pregnant women may reflect a greater prevalence of alcohol dependence in women who continue to binge drink during pregnancy compared with non-pregnant women. Further data are needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H450956044\"><span class=\"h1\">SAFE LEVEL OF ALCOHOL INTAKE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A safe level of alcohol consumption during pregnancy has not been determined. Assessing the impact of alcohol on fetal development is challenging because of variations in maternal alcohol clearance rates, fetal developmental sensitivity, genetic susceptibility, drinking pattern (eg, binge versus daily consumption), and confounders such as polysubstance use. As alcohol is a teratogen that impacts fetal growth and development at all stages of pregnancy, national guidelines and medical societies from multiple countries recommend complete abstinence during pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-intake-and-pregnancy/abstract/7-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-12</a>]. Abstaining from alcohol while pregnant eliminates the risk of alcohol-related birth defects and developmental disabilities, including resultant neurocognitive and behavioral problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-intake-and-pregnancy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p>There is no exact dose-response relationship between the amount of alcohol consumed during the prenatal period and the extent of damage caused by alcohol in the infant. Infants whose mothers consume alcohol during pregnancy can manifest fetal alcohol effects (FAE), alcohol-related birth defects (ARBD), fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS), or they may be normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-intake-and-pregnancy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The term fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) has been coined to describe the broad range of adverse sequelae in alcohol exposed offspring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-intake-and-pregnancy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. A 2018 study of over 6600 United States first grade students from four different communities reported the prevalence of FASD ranged from 1.1 to 5.0 percent, by conservative estimates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-intake-and-pregnancy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. FAS represents the most severe sequelae of fetal alcohol exposure; however, there is a continuum of outcomes associated with prenatal exposure to alcohol that varies by parameter being studied. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Structural development &ndash; A prospective cohort study obtained detailed information about alcohol consumed three months before pregnancy and for each trimester, including the time prior to pregnancy recognition, from 415 Caucasian women in Australia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-intake-and-pregnancy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The researchers then assessed three-dimensional craniofacial images of 415 children taken at 12 months of age. Results from this study, which relied on maternal self-report of alcohol use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-intake-and-pregnancy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], suggest that low levels of prenatal alcohol use can influence craniofacial development of the fetus. However, the clinical significance of these findings remains to be determined.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Birth outcomes &ndash; Although a systematic review did not find a significant increase in risk of low birthweight or birth of a small for gestational age infant for alcohol intake up to 10 g pure <span class=\"nowrap\">alcohol/day</span> (about one drink per day) or an increase in preterm birth for alcohol intake up to 18 g pure <span class=\"nowrap\">alcohol/day</span> (about 1.5 drinks per day), the risk of these outcomes progressively increased and became statistically significant with greater alcohol consumption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-intake-and-pregnancy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. This review did not evaluate the risk of alcohol-related fetal damage (FAE, ARBD, FAS, FASD), which is an important limitation to the conclusions of the meta-analysis. Furthermore, the studies included in the meta-analysis relied on self-reports of alcohol consumption and did not take patterns of alcohol use into account. As such, it did not provide definitive information about the risks associated with light to moderate prenatal alcohol.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neurodevelopmental outcomes &ndash; A series of studies from Denmark that evaluated the effects of maternal self-report of low to moderate alcohol consumption (&lt;9 <span class=\"nowrap\">drinks/week)</span> in early to mid-pregnancy on developmental outcomes (IQ, attention, executive function, motor function, behavior) in 5-year-old children did not find significant effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-intake-and-pregnancy/abstract/19-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-24</a>]. However, there are several limitations to these data. The Danish studies did not conduct FAS diagnostic evaluations and they assessed only preschoolers, which can be misleading because these children were too young to measure the full impact alcohol may have had on their brains. For example, in a large well-designed study from Washington state that followed children up to age 18 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-intake-and-pregnancy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]: although half of older children with FAS exhibited normal developmental scores as preschoolers, all had severe brain dysfunction confirmed by age 10; only 10 percent of children with FAS had attention problems by age 5 but 60 percent had attention problems by the age of 10; and only 30 percent of children with FAS had an IQ below normal, but 100 percent had severe dysfunction in other areas such as language, memory and activity level, which the Danish study did not assess [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-intake-and-pregnancy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p/><p>Patterns of maternal alcohol consumption and socioeconomic and ethnic factors also affect outcome. As an example, binge drinking may exert a potentially greater negative effect than comparable consumption of low amounts of alcohol over several days (eg, four drinks in one sitting versus one drink a day for four days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-intake-and-pregnancy/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>], but this is also controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-intake-and-pregnancy/abstract/19-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-23</a>]. Affluent women tend to be better educated and have access to resources that may be less available to less affluent women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-intake-and-pregnancy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. </p><p>For unknown reasons, older maternal age, high parity, and African-American or Native American ethnicities appear to increase the risk of FAS. Other characteristics associated with women at higher risk for having an alcohol exposed pregnancy include low socioeconomic status, smoking, unmarried, unemployed, use of illicit drugs, history of sexual or physical abuse or neglect, history of incarceration, having a partner or family member who drinks heavily, being socially transient, and having psychologic stress or a mental health disorder [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-intake-and-pregnancy/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>].</p><p>Alcohol freely crosses the placenta: fetal blood alcohol levels approach maternal levels within two hours of maternal intake. Elimination of alcohol relies primarily on maternal metabolic capacity, which varies widely among pregnant women and may help explain why similar amounts of ethanol consumption result in widely varying phenotypic presentations in infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-intake-and-pregnancy/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Polymorphisms of the alcohol dehydrogenase gene could explain variations in blood alcohol levels among individuals ingesting the same amount of ethanol. Maternal, and possibly fetal, polymorphisms of the gene ADH1B appear to contribute to FASD susceptibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-intake-and-pregnancy/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. It is hypothesized that the gene affects peak blood alcohol levels that, in turn, correlate with the risk of adverse fetal effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-intake-and-pregnancy/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>]. ADH1B polymorphisms may affect alcohol levels by affecting alcohol metabolism or alcohol intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-intake-and-pregnancy/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Expression of the cytochrome P450 E1 (CYP2E1) gene also affects alcohol metabolism, and may play a role in vulnerability to FAS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H450956500\"><span class=\"h1\">PERINATAL OUTCOME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alcohol is a teratogen with the potential to cause deleterious effects at all stages of gestation. The effects vary depending upon the quantity and pattern of alcohol consumption, maternal and fetal genetics, maternal age, maternal nutrition, and smoking, among other factors. The most severe consequences of prenatal alcohol exposure are stillbirth and fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD), which encompasses the physical, mental, behavioral, and cognitive effects associated with in utero alcohol exposure. In one large epidemiologic study, an increased rate of stillbirth was noted across all categories of alcohol intake, even after adjusting for confounders (eg, smoking, pre-pregnancy weight) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-intake-and-pregnancy/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The rate of death from fetoplacental dysfunction rose from 1.37 per 1000 births for women consuming less than one drink per week to 8.83 per 1000 births for women consuming greater than or equal to five drinks per week. The clinical features, diagnosis, management, and prognosis of FASD are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fetal-alcohol-spectrum-disorder-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fetal-alcohol-spectrum-disorder-management-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder: Management and prognosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There is continuing uncertainty about the effects of low and low to moderate levels of alcohol intake in pregnancy. Although several studies have not found adverse behavioral and developmental effects, these studies have several methodological limitations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-intake-and-pregnancy/abstract/13,39-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,39-42</a>]. As discussed above, a prospective cohort study reported craniofacial changes with almost any level of prenatal alcohol intake, but clinical significance of these changes is not known [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-intake-and-pregnancy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Higher quality studies related to this type of drinking are needed. Hence, there is confirmed &quot;safe&quot; threshold of alcohol exposure during pregnancy, and avoiding alcohol may be the most prudent approach. (See <a href=\"#H450956044\" class=\"local\">'Safe level of alcohol intake'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H450956643\"><span class=\"h1\">SCREENING FOR ALCOHOL MISUSE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H450956649\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All pregnant women should be screened for use of licit and illicit substances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-intake-and-pregnancy/abstract/7,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,43</a>]. Many screening options are possible, from self-administered questionnaires to analysis of biological samples taken from the pregnant woman or her offspring. A practical, effective approach is to interview each woman with respectful and sensitive use of neutrally worded questions. It is preferable to begin by asking about lawful substances, such as cigarette smoking and alcohol, followed by questions about illicit drugs.</p><p>The typical questions asked about the quantity and frequency of alcohol use are less helpful in the assessment of prenatal alcohol consumption than in other populations. This discordancy is due to modification of alcohol consumption once pregnancy is recognized and the fact that traditional alcohol screening measures were developed in male alcoholics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-intake-and-pregnancy/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. In addition, admission of alcohol use during pregnancy can be stigmatizing; thus, women may be reluctant to admit to any amount of drinking.</p><p>Clinicians can choose screening strategies that are appropriate for their clinical population and setting. T-ACE, TWEAK, and AUDIT-C are brief alcohol screening questionnaires used to identify problem drinking in pregnant women. In a systematic review of these instruments and others (CAGE, SMAST), at-risk&nbsp;drinking&nbsp;sensitivity was highest for T-ACE (69 to 88 percent), TWEAK (71 to 91 percent) and AUDIT-C (95 percent), with high specificity (71 to 89 percent, 73 to 83 percent and 85 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-intake-and-pregnancy/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. CAGE and SMAST performed poorly. Sensitivity of AUDIT-C at score &ge;3 was 100 percent for past year alcohol dependence and 90 percent for alcohol use disorder, with moderate specificity (71 percent for each).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H450956709\"><span class=\"h3\">T-ACE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The T-ACE is a simple screening instrument for alcohol use designed specifically for the prenatal setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-intake-and-pregnancy/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. It identifies a range of alcohol consumption from any current prenatal drinking, prepregnancy risk drinking defined as more than two drinks per drinking day, to lifetime alcohol diagnoses based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-intake-and-pregnancy/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. The T-ACE questions are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How many drinks does it take for you to feel high (<strong>TOLERANCE</strong>)?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do you feel <strong>ANNOYED</strong> by people complaining about your drinking?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have you ever felt the need to <strong>CUT</strong> down on your drinking?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have you ever had a drink first thing in the morning (<strong>EYE-OPENER</strong>)?</p><p/><p>One point is given for each affirmative answer to the <strong>A</strong>nnoy, <strong>C</strong>ut-down, and <strong>E</strong>ye-opener questions; 2 points are allotted if a woman reports tolerance to more than two drinks.

The overall sensitivity (ie, the probability that a woman who is a risk drinker scores positive) of T-ACE is 69 percent, with specificity of 85 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-intake-and-pregnancy/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H450956757\"><span class=\"h3\">TWEAK</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TWEAK is another screening instrument used in pregnant women:</p><p> &#160;T = <strong>TOLERANCE</strong> for alcohol</p><p> &#160;W = <strong>WORRY</strong> or concern by family or friends about drinking behavior</p><p> &#160;E = <strong>EYE OPENER</strong>, the need to have a drink in the morning</p><p> &#160;A = &quot;blackouts&quot; or <strong>AMNESIA</strong> while drinking</p><p> &#160;K = the self-perception of the need to <strong>CUT DOWN</strong> on alcohol use.</p><p>Scores range from 0 to 7. The tolerance and worry questions each contribute 2 points and the other three questions contribute 1 point each. Any endorsement of the worry question is scored a 2; on the tolerance question, if three or more drinks are needed to feel high, the question is scored as a 2. Other versions of the <strong>TOLERANCE</strong> question ask:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How many drinks does it take before the alcohol makes you fall asleep or pass out?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you never drink till you pass out, what is the largest number of drinks you have or can hold?</p><p/><p>If the woman answers &quot;five or more drinks,&quot; these questions are given a score of 2 points.</p><p>A total score of &ge;3 on the TWEAK is suggestive of heavy drinking patterns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-intake-and-pregnancy/abstract/48-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-50</a>].

Recent alcohol intake is evaluated by measuring the blood alcohol level; this level can be estimated by breathalyzer. Individual variability in ethanol pharmacokinetics makes interpretation of alcohol levels challenging. Chronic alcohol consumption may be suspected based on abnormalities of liver function tests, macrocytosis, anemia, or carbohydrate-deficient transferrin (which is affected by pregnancy). Fatty acid ethyl esters are a direct biomarker of alcohol that persists in blood for at least 24 hours after the last alcohol intake, and can also be detected in maternal hair and neonatal meconium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-intake-and-pregnancy/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. It is the tool most often used for estimating the incidence of prenatal exposure to ethanol as it has high sensitivity and specificity.

This was illustrated in a trial that randomized 250 pregnant women with a positive alcohol screen to either comprehensive alcohol assessment only or to the same comprehensive assessment with a brief intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-intake-and-pregnancy/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].

Reported benefits of intervention include reduced consumption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-intake-and-pregnancy/abstract/64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65</a>], reduced risk for an alcohol-exposed pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-intake-and-pregnancy/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>], higher rates of abstinence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-intake-and-pregnancy/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>], and improvement in fetal and newborn outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-intake-and-pregnancy/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. In one randomized trial, including a partner chosen by the patient during treatment led to greater reduction in alcohol use, particularly among heavy drinkers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alcohol-intake-and-pregnancy/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p>Some alcohol abusers require referral for in-depth counseling and treatment regimens.
