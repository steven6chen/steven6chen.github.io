During this stage, the horizontal or &quot;radial&quot; growth phase, the melanoma is almost always curable by surgical excision alone. Melanomas that infiltrate deep into the dermis are in a &quot;vertical&quot; growth phase and have metastatic potential. A definitive diagnosis of melanoma is made by pathological analysis of a biopsy of the lesion.

A tool may be more complex than asking the patient directly about general risk factors. Furthermore, a particular tool may not be applicable to all patients.

Data are available from observational studies; however, in general, observational studies are subject to potential study bias (lead time bias, length bias). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evidence-based-approach-to-prevention#H20178008\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evidence-based approach to prevention&quot;, section on 'Special biases'</a>.)</p><p>Further, the observational studies in the medical literature about melanoma screening vary as to who performed the screening, which target populations were screened, and which components of care were included as screening. For example, screening could have been directed at all individuals (eg, population-based screening) or targeted to only those with specific risk factors. Some studies of &quot;screening&quot; for melanoma extended their scope to include forms of early diagnosis (examination of patients with a concern about a skin lesion, termed &ldquo;lesion directed screening&rdquo; but not &ldquo;screening&rdquo; by a clinician of an asymptomatic individual), and some studies incorporated patient education programs in addition to screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-and-early-detection-of-melanoma-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2719698815\"><span class=\"h2\">Potential benefits</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The benefits of screening for melanoma may seem straightforward because the prognosis of melanoma is related to its stage and thickness. Detection by screening has been associated with thinner melanomas at diagnosis, prognosis is significantly better for thinner (early-stage) compared with later-stage melanoma, cutaneous melanoma is usually visible on the skin, visual skin examination is safe and well tolerated by patients, and risk factors for melanoma are readily identifiable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-and-early-detection-of-melanoma-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/9,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,31</a>].</p><p>However, there are many other variables involved. Effectiveness of screening skin examination depends on multiple additional factors including the clinician&rsquo;s ability to identify early-stage disease, the natural history of some melanomas that are not amenable to identification at early stages, the pathologist&rsquo;s ability to diagnose and histologically stage the disease, and identification of the tumor at a stage where treatment would be more effective. In addition, screening may lead to overdiagnosis of melanoma (ie, the diagnosis of melanoma that is either non-growing, or so slow-growing that it would never become clinically meaningful during the patient&rsquo;s lifetime).

However, observational studies have consistently shown that melanomas detected by clinicians during a skin examination are thinner than those detected by patient self-examination, and it is known that melanomas that are thinner at detection have a lower mortality rate. A randomized trial of screening is likely not feasible, as it has been estimated that approximately 800,000 participants would be required to detect a difference in mortality because of the relatively low melanoma mortality rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-and-early-detection-of-melanoma-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3501366194\"><span class=\"h3\">Effect on mortality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Observational data about the effect on mortality rate of clinician screening include a large year-long population screening effort in Germany, the Skin Cancer Research to Provide Evidence for Effectiveness of Screening in Northern Germany project (SCREEN), in which clinician skin examination was associated with a mortality reduction five years after the screening program, although the mortality reduction did not persist in longer-term follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-and-early-detection-of-melanoma-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/32,33,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33,37</a>].</p><p>The SCREEN pilot study began with a program to generate intensive public and professional awareness, followed by offers for screening by general practitioners. Among 1.9 million adults, 360,000 chose to be screened (three-quarters of participants choose screening by a non-dermatologist trained in skin examination). Overall, 620 persons needed to be screened to detect one melanoma. Ninety percent of melanomas detected by screening were less than 1 mm thick. Five years following the screening effort, despite a screening participation rate under 20 percent, mortality from melanoma among adults in the pilot program area was nearly 50 percent lower than in the rest of Germany and was lower than expected based on historical rates. However, the mortality decline seen at the five-year mark was not sustained; two years later, mortality rates returned to the pre-screening level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-and-early-detection-of-melanoma-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>In contrast to the mortality benefit observed at five years in the SCREEN pilot study, a subsequent nationwide program in Germany to offer adults aged &ge;35 years skin cancer screening every two years demonstrated no measurable decline in melanoma mortality through five years of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-and-early-detection-of-melanoma-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/38-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-42</a>]. Reasons for the difference in mortality outcomes between the pilot and the nationwide program are uncertain. In the nationwide effort, there was no prescreening awareness campaign, patients could not be directly referred to dermatologists based solely on risk factor assessment, and less thorough screening may have occurred. In addition, one analysis raised questions about the reliability of using ICD-10 codes to determine cause of mortality in the pilot; during the time when melanoma deaths decreased, there was an unexplained increase in codes indicating deaths due to malignant neoplasms of ill-defined, secondary and unspecified sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-and-early-detection-of-melanoma-in-adults-and-adolescents/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].
