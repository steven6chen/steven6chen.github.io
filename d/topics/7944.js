It is usually the result of a hormonal imbalance and typically occurs during infancy, adolescence, or mid to late life. Gynecomastia must be distinguished from the breast enlargement due to fat deposits seen in overweight men. The condition often goes away on its own, but treatments are available for severe or persistent cases. When gynecomastia is the result of an underlying health problem, treatment of that problem usually improves the gynecomastia as well.</p><p>Up to 70 percent of boys in early to mid-puberty experience gynecomastia because of the normal hormonal changes that occur during puberty. Gynecomastia is also common among middle-aged and older men. In this population, up to 65 percent of men are affected.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">COMMON CAUSES OF GYNECOMASTIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although people tend to think of androgens (such as testosterone) as &quot;male hormones&quot; and estrogens as &quot;female hormones,&quot; people of both sexes produce both types of hormones. In males, androgens are by far the predominant hormone, but small amounts of estrogen are also present. Gynecomastia can happen when the balance shifts, with an increase in estrogen or decrease in androgens. This can occur because of expected hormonal changes during puberty or aging or because of the use of certain drugs or herbal products.</p><p>The most common causes of gynecomastia in adult men that seek a medical evaluation for gynecomastia include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pubertal gynecomastia that does not resolve &ndash; 25 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drugs &ndash; 10 to 25 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unknown causes (idiopathic) &ndash; 25 percent</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Puberty</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gynecomastia that occurs during puberty usually resolves without treatment within six months to two years. The condition sometimes develops between ages 10 and 12 years and most commonly occurs between ages 13 and 14 years. The condition persists beyond age 17 years in up to 20 percent of individuals.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many drugs have been associated with gynecomastia, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spironolactone (brand name: Aldactone), a drug used to treat heart failure, high blood pressure, and several other conditions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketoconazole-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Ketoconazole</a>, a drug used to treat fungal infections.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cimetidine (brand name: Tagamet), ranitidine (brand name: Zantac), and related drugs called H2-receptor blockers. These drugs are used to treat stomach ulcers and severe heartburn.</p><p/><p>If gynecomastia is caused by one of the drugs you take, your health care provider may recommend that you stop using the drug and might replace it with another drug that is less likely to cause the condition.</p><p>Gynecomastia occurs in up to 75 percent of men who take drugs called antiandrogens to treat prostate cancer. While these men may not be able to stop or substitute their prostate cancer treatment, they may be able to take steps to prevent gynecomastia. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Prostate cancer patients'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Herbal products</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gynecomastia in children has been associated with regular use of skin care products (lotions, soaps, and shampoos) containing tea tree oil and lavender oil&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gynecomastia-breast-enlargement-in-men-beyond-the-basics/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. These oils contain plant estrogens and can affect the body's hormone balance. Gynecomastia usually resolves completely after stopping the products. Soy products, such as soy milk, do not usually cause gynecomastia unless very large quantities are consumed regularly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment for HIV/AIDS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Men taking combination treatment for human immunodeficiency virus <span class=\"nowrap\">(HIV)/acquired</span> immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), called highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), sometimes develop enlarged breasts. In most cases, this breast enlargement is due to fat redistribution, which is a side effect of the treatment. In some cases, though, true gynecomastia has been associated with HAART.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Unknown causes (idiopathic)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is not always clear what causes gynecomastia during mid to late life. Still, as men age, blood testosterone levels tend to decline, and the hormone balance changes to a higher amount of estrogen-to-testosterone ratio. These factors probably conspire to account for most cases of &quot;idiopathic&quot; gynecomastia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">GYNECOMASTIA EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gynecomastia should not be confused with pseudogynecomastia, which occurs in overweight men whose breasts enlarge because of fat deposits.</p><p>If you are a man or boy with enlarged or tender breasts, your health care provider will perform an examination to determine whether the tissue in your breasts is fatty or glandular. Glandular tissue is designed to secrete substances, such as milk or hormones, and usually has a network of ducts that can be felt.</p><p>If the provider has difficulty determining whether you have gynecomastia, he or she may recommend that you have a breast ultrasound or a mammogram, a specialized X-ray of the breast.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In certain situations, blood tests may be ordered to measure the level of hormones. Blood tests are not usually needed if the cause of the gynecomastia (eg, puberty, drugs) is identified.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">GYNECOMASTIA TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The best treatment for gynecomastia depends upon its cause, duration, and severity and whether it causes pain or discomfort.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Adolescents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because pubertal gynecomastia usually goes away on its own, treatment is not usually recommended initially. Instead, the provider will watch for changes in size for several months. In most cases, pubertal gynecomastia resolves during that time.</p><p>For boys with severe gynecomastia that is causing substantial tenderness or embarrassment, a short course of a drug called tamoxifen (sample brand name: Nolvadex) or raloxifene (brand name: Evista) may be recommended. These drugs block the effects of estrogen in the body and can reduce the size of the breasts somewhat. However, neither of these drugs is approved in the United States for the treatment of gynecomastia. Drugs may be prescribed without US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, although the risks and benefits have not been studied completely.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Adult men</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment is not usually recommended in adult men whose gynecomastia is likely to be caused by an underlying health problem or by drugs. In these men, treating the underlying condition or stopping the problematic drug usually allows the gynecomastia to resolve.</p><p>For men with idiopathic gynecomastia that causes discomfort and lasts more than three months, a short course (three to six months) of tamoxifen or raloxifene may be recommended.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Prostate cancer patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gynecomastia is a common complication of hormonal treatment for prostate cancer (androgen deprivation therapy or antiandrogen monotherapy). However, there are treatment options available to prevent the development of gynecomastia, including tamoxifen and radiation therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-for-advanced-prostate-cancer-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Treatment for advanced prostate cancer (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Tamoxifen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tamoxifen can be taken along with the hormonal anti-prostate cancer treatment (androgen deprivation or antiandrogen monotherapy). Tamoxifen must be taken every day for the duration of antiandrogen treatment. In one study, only 8 percent of men who took an antiandrogen plus tamoxifen developed gynecomastia (compared with 68 percent of men who took the antiandrogen alone) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gynecomastia-breast-enlargement-in-men-beyond-the-basics/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Tamoxifen may also be given to men who develop gynecomastia while taking antiandrogens.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Radiation therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treating the breasts with radiation before antiandrogen treatment begins can prevent gynecomastia in some men. Radiation treatment is usually delivered in one to three sessions (similar to having an X-ray). In the study above, 34 percent of men who had radiation treatment before antiandrogen therapy developed gynecomastia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/gynecomastia-breast-enlargement-in-men-beyond-the-basics/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Gynecomastia that has already developed can be treated with higher radiation doses and may improve pain. However, when given after breasts have already developed, radiation is not very effective at reducing breast size.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Radiation therapy versus tamoxifen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although tamoxifen is more effective than radiation for men who take antiandrogen monotherapy, tamoxifen must be taken for the duration of antiandrogen therapy. For some men, taking one to three sessions of radiation therapy is more convenient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although tamoxifen and raloxifene are effective for men and boys who have had enlarged breasts for a few months, the drug is not effective in men whose breast tissue is not tender or who have had the condition for more than one year. For these men, surgery is an option to reduce the size of the breasts. For adolescents, surgery is generally not recommended until puberty is completed; there might be regrowth of the breast tissue if the surgery is performed before puberty is completed.</p><p>The extent of surgery depends upon the severity of the breast enlargement and whether there is also excess fatty tissue. Many men are treated with a combination of surgical removal of the glandular tissue and liposuction.</p><p>More extensive cosmetic surgery, including partial surgical removal of the breast skin, is required for men with more severe breast enlargement or those who have excessive sagging of the breast tissue that might occur after weight loss.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gynecomastia in adolescent boys is usually caused by puberty-related hormonal changes. Pubertal gynecomastia usually resolves on its own, but the condition persists into adulthood in up to 20 percent of individuals. In extreme or painful cases, a brief course of tamoxifen might be recommended.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gynecomastia in adult men may be caused by an underlying health problem or by the use of a drug.
