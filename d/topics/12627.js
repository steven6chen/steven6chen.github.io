OA-related pain results from a multifactorial biopsychosocial process in which non-cartilaginous structures, including the subchondral bone, synovium, and periarticular structures, are involved and are influenced by environmental and psychosocial factors. Peripheral and central sensitization of nociceptive pathways may ultimately drive the perpetuation of pain and play a role in the chronic aspects of the disease. OA-related pain has negative impacts on mood and sleep and frequently affects participation in occupational and recreational activities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>There are multiple components of the management of OA. They range from the approach to common OA-related conditions such as depression, sleeping disturbances, and social problems to joint-specific interventions including nonpharmacologic, pharmacologic, and surgical options. Ultimately, most are aimed at improving the pain and functional restriction that characterizes this prevalent disease. Despite numerous efforts, treatments to modify the course of the disease have not reached a threshold of efficacy to gain regulatory approval.</p><p>An overview of OA management as well as prognosis will be discussed here. Separate topic reviews on the pathogenesis, risk factors, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and joint-specific treatment recommendations for OA include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-osteoarthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of osteoarthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-for-and-possible-causes-of-osteoarthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors for and possible causes of osteoarthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-osteoarthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of osteoarthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-knee-osteoarthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of knee osteoarthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-moderate-to-severe-knee-osteoarthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of moderate to severe knee osteoarthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H730969074\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The principles of chronic disease management apply to the care of patients with osteoarthritis (OA) and are based on the following: care should be continuous, tailored to patients according to individual needs, goals, and values, and be patient-centered; decision-making should be based on the best evidence available, with prioritization of the safety of the patient; information should be widely accessible to patients; and anticipation of needs should be prioritized over a reactive health service design [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Patient's adherence, optimal uptake of recommendations, and behavior modifications are key elements of OA treatment and can be optimized by OA and self-management education, establishing treatment goals, and periodic monitoring.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1264807424\"><span class=\"h2\">Education</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients should be fully informed about the etiology of OA, risk factors (especially the ones that are modifiable and specific to the patient), and expected prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Clear information about the treatment options along with their benefits, harms, and costs should also be discussed. Providing this information helps to counter common misconceptions and direct the focus of the treatment to the patient, encouraging an active behavior in the management of their own diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Patient education is an essential tool to optimize OA management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. A substantial part of the noncompliance with treatment, particularly when it comes to lifestyle changes, may occur due to the limited time that clinicians take to explain the purpose of the interventions and what the patient should expect in terms of pain relief.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1225562277\"><span class=\"h2\">Self-management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Self-management education is a complement to traditional patient education [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. It aims at teaching patients problem-solving skills and involves the concept of self-efficacy. This in turn gives patients confidence in their capacity to carry out a particular behavior necessary to reach a desired goal. Self-management education can occur through several ways such as face-to-face meetings, group sessions, the Internet, and telephone-based sessions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. A Cochrane review comparing self-management education programs and standard care found small benefits in terms of self-management skills and OA symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2505233827\"><span class=\"h2\">Goal-setting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Setting goals helps the informed patient identify current issues, set priorities, and focus on specific changes. To develop a realistic plan, goals should be agreed upon with patients, considering their preferences and their biopsychosocial context. In addition, appropriate goals should be specific, timely, and measurable and should be reviewed periodically. Long-term goals should be broken up into short-term achievable steps (eg, start walking for 10 minutes on three days of the week to ultimately be able to walk for 30 minutes on three days of the week in three months' time) and achievements should be positively reinforced.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2272348207\"><span class=\"h1\">MONITORING AND ASSESSMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management of patients with osteoarthritis (OA) should include a holistic assessment which considers the global needs of the patient. Monitoring of the patient's response to therapy should be done on a regular basis. While a variety of clinical tools have been developed for clinical symptom assessment and monitoring, the evaluation of treatment response is based primarily on the clinical evaluation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3620093972\"><span class=\"h2\">Periodic monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Periodic clinical assessments should be performed regularly (ideally every three months) to assess the effects of treatment on symptoms, functionality, and status, as well as quantify objective changes in metrics related to interventions such as weight and muscle strength. Assessing the patient periodically enables regular coaching and the reinforcement of the action plan. This also allows for monitoring of treatment effectiveness, side effects, and alterations to the management plan according to outcome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2983253590\"><span class=\"h2\">Holistic assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A holistic assessment of the patient with OA facilitates a patient-professional partnership and collaborative care in which patients and health care professionals make decisions related to treatment together, building upon each other to improve outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. OA is a multifaceted disease in which the structural evidence of joint damage frequently does not correlate with the presence and severity of joint pain and disability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Moreover, patients with OA are predominantly older adults who frequently have different personal priorities and aspirations, which impacts the treatment choice.</p><p>The illness perception and the consequences of the disease vary substantially from person to person and are influenced by a number of factors that, if not identified, will hamper the development of an appropriate tailored plan and limit the success of treatment. Important factors that should be addressed by the clinician include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Previous knowledge of OA and its treatment options</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impact of pain and functional impairment on activities of daily living and quality of life</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Participation restriction</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recreational and occupational aspirations</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mood disturbances and level of distress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep disturbances</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Falls risk assessment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence of social support</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence of comorbidities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Expectations of treatment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Modifiable risk factors, especially <span class=\"nowrap\">overweight/obesity,</span> joint alignment, and <span class=\"nowrap\">injury/buckling</span></p><p/><p>Patient preferences for certain types of therapies should also be assessed, as compliance and outcomes can be compromised if the care plan does not meet the patient's preferences and beliefs, modified or not by OA education. After addressing these factors, a personalized package of care can be developed and agreed upon with the patient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2667270493\"><span class=\"h2\">Other assessment measures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evaluation of treatment response in OA is based on clinical assessment, as there is no established role for laboratory or imaging tests in assessing disease <span class=\"nowrap\">activity/status</span> in clinical practice. As a result, they are not required for OA diagnosis or disease monitoring. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-osteoarthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of osteoarthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are a variety of clinical tools aimed at evaluating the clinical status and patient-reported outcomes in OA that are mainly used in clinical research [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, some clinicians use these tools in clinical practice. The approach in our interdisciplinary OA clinic is to use the <a href=\"http://www.koos.nu/koos-english.pdf&amp;token=IPKGp0/9v537QiA+3405+kcHB+kAny27Lq9c98rX8tKI/GwWFA0V6Ew0ybiCCYns&amp;TOPIC_ID=106097\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score</a> (KOOS) and the <a href=\"http://www.koos.nu/HOOSEng.pdf&amp;token=IPKGp0/9v537QiA+3405+hR4QDp2SPUNvOtHkj3dip9K07jyutfJNJL9zlKBjExL&amp;TOPIC_ID=106097\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score</a> (HOOS) to assess patient-reported measures in patients with knee and hip OA, respectively, and the six-minute walk test and timed up-and-go test to assess physical function based on patient's performance.</p><p>A few of the most commonly used instruments are described in more detail below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Knee and hip osteoarthritis</strong> &ndash; The Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) questionnaire has been widely used to assess pain, stiffness, and physical function in patients with hip <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> knee OA. It consists of 24 items rated on a 5-point Likert scale and is easy to complete [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The KOOS and the HOOS are also broadly studied and used questionnaires to assess patients with knee and hip OA, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. They are composed of five domains including pain, other symptoms, difficult-to-perform activities of daily living, sports and recreational activities, and knee-related quality of life.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The timed up-and-go and the 40-meter walk tests are good measures of physical function based on patient's performance and have adequate psychometric properties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Other tests include 30-second chair test, stair-climb test, and the six-minute walk test.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hand osteoarthritis </strong>&ndash; The most commonly used tool to assess pain in patients with hand OA is the <span class=\"nowrap\">Australian/Canadian</span> Hand OA Index (AUSCAN) pain subscale, in addition to the visual analog scale (VAS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The AUSCAN Index includes three subscales to assess pain, disability, and joint stiffness in hand OA, using 15 questions. It is brief and easy to score and has good psychometric properties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Function status is most frequently assessed using the AUSCAN function subscale and the Functional Index for Hand Osteoarthritis (FIHOA), in addition to physical tests measuring grip and pinch strength [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The FIHOA is composed of 10 items rated on a 4-point scale to measure the ability to perform common activities using the hand [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3729865440\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goals of osteoarthritis (OA) management are to minimize pain, optimize function, and beneficially modify the process of joint damage. The primary aim of clinicians should include targeting modifiable risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Although there are no approved disease-modifying OA drugs, a wide selection of interventions are available to address pain and function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Due to the modest effects of the individual treatment options, a combination of therapeutic approaches is commonly used in practice and should prioritize therapies that are safer before considering drugs that can potentially cause harm (eg, opioids and oral nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs [NSAIDs]).</p><p>In addition to benefits, side effect profile, and patient-specific impairments and preferences, costs of interventions and local availability should also be considered. As an example, intraarticular <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyaluronate-derivatives-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hyaluronic acid</a> injections are associated with high costs without clinically significant benefits over intraarticular placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. A discussion of the efficacy of hyaluronans is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-knee-osteoarthritis#H821166356\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of knee osteoarthritis&quot;, section on 'Hyaluronans'</a>.)</p><p>Management should also be individualized and target modifiable factors contributing to pain, particularly presence of joint malalignment, muscle weakness, overweight and obesity, and concurrent depression. The number of joints involved, presence of articular versus periarticular pain, and the degree of movement restriction and functional impairment should also guide the therapeutic plan.</p><p>Our management strategy is generally consistent with guidelines developed by professional organizations, including the American College of Rheumatology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], the European League Against Rheumatism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-27</a>], the Osteoarthritis Research Society International [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], and the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, it is important to note that the overall quality of OA care has been found to be suboptimal in many countries, with less than 50 percent compliance with indicators of appropriate care, which is inferior to other chronic conditions such as diabetes and osteoporosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The particular domains in which OA care was poor were pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments, with less than 40 percent of appropriateness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

A combination of aerobic and strengthening exercises is usually indicated to address the whole spectrum of disability associated with OA, but optimal prescription should be individualized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

Pharmacologic therapy should only be used during periods when symptoms are present, since none of the interventions have been shown to be disease-modifying. The main medications used in the pharmacologic management of OA include oral and topical NSAIDs, topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capsaicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capsaicin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=duloxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">duloxetine</a>, and intraarticular glucocorticoids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

The use of NSAIDs in most patients is limited by the increased risk of serious gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, and renal complications. In patients with comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, and advanced age, a cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 selective NSAID or a nonselective NSAID associated with a proton-pump inhibitor should be used, though we prefer not to use these medications in patients with a high comorbidity risk (eg, previous gastrointestinal bleeding or chronic renal failure).

These include the contribution of sensitization of nociceptive pathways and other external factors (ie, psychosocial) in different stages of OA, the role of neuropathic pain, and the influence of disease phenotypes in the patterns of pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Instead of a single structure or pathway responsible for pain onset or associated with its persistence, it is likely that the experience of pain has a multifactorial etiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. In this regard, multiple joint structures (eg, periarticular muscles and ligaments, bone, and synovium) and altered modulation of stimulus transmission act in concert with psychosocial and environmental influences, as described below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Extraarticular factors</strong> &ndash; Extraarticular factors may influence the experience of pain and are usually unique to each patient, with significant between-person differences.

Changes in the size and severity of bone marrow lesions, joint effusion, and synovitis over time have been associated with fluctuations in pain, in addition to a higher prevalence of pain in knees in which these features were present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Moreover, severe cartilage damage on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is also related to symptoms which probably occur through secondary mechanisms, since cartilage is aneural and unable to directly generate pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition, periarticular sources of pain such as pes anserine bursitis at the knee and trochanteric bursitis at the hip often coexist with OA and contribute to the symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sensitization of nociceptive pathways </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>A number of peripheral substances have been associated with OA-related pain and include inflammatory mediators (eg, prostaglandin E2, interleukin [IL]-1beta, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha), nerve growth factor (NGF), and sodium and calcium ions channels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. These substances are involved in the activation of primary afferent nerves in response to inflammation or injury to the tissue and have been studied as potential targets for treatment of OA pain (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=investigational-approaches-to-the-management-of-osteoarthritis#H2868249826\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Investigational approaches to the management of osteoarthritis&quot;, section on 'Inflammatory pathways'</a>). When persistent, they lead to plastic changes in the cells that become more easily activated so that innocuous movements or loading of the joint evoke exaggerated responses (allodynia). Over time, persistent pain may occur even during resting or lying. This is the neurophysiological basis of the peripheral sensitization which occurs at the level of the joint.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Sensitization of the central nociceptive processing can also occur and involves changes at the spinal cord and cortical levels. In practice, central sensitization is also associated with a more diffuse and referred pattern of pain and with emotional consequences to pain through the activation of regions such as amygdala, thalamus, and cingulate cortex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dissociation between symptoms versus radiographic disease </strong>&ndash; There is great discordance between joint symptoms and extent of radiographic disease. In patients with frequent hip pain, only 15.6 percent showed evidence of radiographic OA (Kellgren-Lawrence grade [KLG] &ge;2), and 20.7 percent of hips with radiographic OA were symptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. With regard to knee OA, a systematic review has shown that 15 to 81 percent of patients with radiographic OA had knee pain and 15 to 76 percent of those with knee pain had radiographic OA, with significant differences in pain definition, radiographic views, and demographic factors among studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">On the other hand, studies correlating pain and OA severity have found a higher prevalence of knee pain in patients with KLG 4 compared with KLG 2 or 3 and in patients with greater rates of cartilage loss in the medial tibiofemoral compartment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>].

Interventions delivered by invasive routes (ie, intraarticular injections and acupuncture) were associated with more robust placebo effects compared with oral or topical placebos. Moreover, the effect of several oral nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=celecoxib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">celecoxib</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diclofenac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diclofenac</a>) was not significantly superior to intraarticular placebo, assessed by indirect comparison [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. In addition to alleviating pain, improvements in other common clinical OA outcomes have also been observed with placebo such as stiffness and joint function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The landmark GAIT trial (<strong>G</strong><span class=\"nowrap\">lucosamine/<strong>C</strong>hondroitin</span> <strong>A</strong>rthritis <strong>I</strong>ntervention) compared the effects of glucosamine, chondroitin sulfate, the combination of them, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=celecoxib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">celecoxib</a>, and oral placebo and has demonstrated that at least 20 percent improvement in pain assessed by the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) questionnaire (primary outcome) was achieved by 60 percent of participants in the placebo group, while effects of active treatment groups ranged from 64 to 70 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-osteoarthritis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p/><p>A number of determinants are able to evoke a placebo response.

Moreover, there is suboptimal referral to allied health professionals; inadequate uptake of safety recommendations for the prescription of OA medications, such as NSAIDs; inappropriate indication of non-beneficial surgical interventions such as arthroscopic debridement and lavage; and excessive use of imaging, such as MRI, which frequently does not beneficially change the decision-making.</p><p>The complex nature of OA my also pose a significant challenge in translating evidence into routine clinical practice. The extensive range of risk factors driving the disease, the heterogeneous clinical and radiological presentation of patients with OA, and the distinct clinical courses that can occur may make extrapolation of research findings to different populations problematic.

Treatment can be optimized by OA and self-management education, establishing treatment goals, and periodic monitoring. (See <a href=\"#H730969074\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of OA should include a holistic assessment which considers the global needs of the patient. Patient preferences for certain types of therapies should also be assessed, as compliance and outcomes can be compromised if the care plan does not meet the patient's preferences and beliefs. (See <a href=\"#H2983253590\" class=\"local\">'Holistic assessment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The goals of OA management are to minimize pain, optimize function, and beneficially modify the process of joint damage. The primary aim of clinicians should include targeting modifiable risk factors. Due to the modest effects of the individual treatment options, a combination of therapeutic approaches is commonly used in practice and should prioritize therapies that are safer. (See <a href=\"#H3729865440\" class=\"local\">'Overview of management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonpharmacologic interventions are the mainstay of OA management and should be tried first, followed by or in concert with medications to relieve pain when necessary. Nonpharmacologic therapies including weight management and exercises, braces and foot orthoses for patients suitable to these interventions, education, and use of assistive devices when required. (See <a href=\"#H381224960\" class=\"local\">'Nonpharmacologic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The main medications used in the pharmacologic management of OA include oral and topical nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capsaicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capsaicin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=duloxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">duloxetine</a>, and intraarticular glucocorticoids. Our general approach to pharmacotherapy is described below. More specific recommendations are included in separate topic reviews. (See <a href=\"#H4010304703\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacologic therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In patients with one or a few joints affected, especially knee <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hand OA, we initiate pharmacotherapy with topical NSAIDs due to their similar efficacy compared with oral NSAIDs and their better safety profile. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-knee-osteoarthritis#H3054413191\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of knee osteoarthritis&quot;, section on 'Topical NSAIDs'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We use oral NSAIDs in patients with inadequate symptom relief with topical NSAIDs, patients with symptomatic OA in multiple joints, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> patients with hip OA. We use the lowest dose required to control the patient's symptoms on an as-needed basis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-moderate-to-severe-knee-osteoarthritis#H3385575727\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of moderate to severe knee osteoarthritis&quot;, section on 'Oral NSAIDs'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=duloxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">duloxetine</a> for patients with OA in multiple joints and concomitant comorbidities that may contraindicate oral NSAIDs and for patients with knee OA who have not responded satisfactorily to other interventions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-moderate-to-severe-knee-osteoarthritis#H3625794345\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of moderate to severe knee osteoarthritis&quot;, section on 'Duloxetine'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=capsaicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">capsaicin</a> is an option when one or a few joints are involved and other interventions are ineffective or contraindicated; however, its use may be limited by common local side effects. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-knee-osteoarthritis#H2586645375\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of knee osteoarthritis&quot;, section on 'Topical capsaicin'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We do not routinely use intraarticular glucocorticoid injections due to the short duration of its effects (ie, approximately four weeks). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-moderate-to-severe-knee-osteoarthritis#H1879045343\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of moderate to severe knee osteoarthritis&quot;, section on 'Intraarticular glucocorticoid injection'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We avoid prescribing opioids due to their overall small effects on pain over placebo and potential side effects (eg, nausea, dizziness, drowsiness), especially for long-term use and in the older adult population. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-knee-osteoarthritis#H1752620244\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of knee osteoarthritis&quot;, section on 'Opioids'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We do not routinely recommend nutritional supplements such as glucosamine, chondroitin, vitamin D, diacerein, avocado soybean unsaponifiables (ASU), and fish oil due to lack of clear evidence demonstrating a clinically important benefit from these supplements. However, a few supplements such as chondroitin, ASU, and fish oil may have small effects on symptoms, and patients with mild disease may benefit more from these therapies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-knee-osteoarthritis#H2096440013\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of knee osteoarthritis&quot;, section on 'Glucosamine and chondroitin'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-knee-osteoarthritis#H3154930506\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of knee osteoarthritis&quot;, section on 'Other nutritional supplements'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical treatment is dominated by total joint replacement, which is highly effective in patients with advanced knee and hip OA when conservative therapies have failed to provide adequate pain relief. (See <a href=\"#H3284753606\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The discordance of radiographic findings to pain supports the notion that the mechanisms of pain are complex and likely multifactorial. The placebo effect is also known to impact response to therapy. (See <a href=\"#H277527328\" class=\"local\">'Factors affecting response to therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1992280113\" class=\"local\">'Mechanisms of pain'</a> above and <a href=\"#H138459518\" class=\"local\">'Role of placebo effect'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3664870100\" class=\"local\">'Barriers to implementation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although there is great variability among individuals and among different phenotypes of OA, courses of pain and physical functioning have been found to be predominantly stable, without substantial improvement or deterioration of symptoms over time.
