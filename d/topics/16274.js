Educational status has significant effects on long-term health [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-learning-disabilities-in-children-role-of-the-primary-care-provider/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Factors that are associated with positive health outcomes include attending a high-quality preschool, social-emotional status in elementary school, and completion of high school [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-learning-disabilities-in-children-role-of-the-primary-care-provider/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Early intervention programs, offered before the age of five years, appear to be particularly important predictors of future health status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-learning-disabilities-in-children-role-of-the-primary-care-provider/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. For these reasons, routine supervision of a child's education is an important component of well-child care.</p><p>The role of the primary care provider in the evaluation and management of learning disabilities (LD) in children will be discussed here. The clinical features, evaluation, and management of LD in the educational system and laws pertaining to specific learning disabilities in the United States, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=specific-learning-disabilities-in-children-clinical-features\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Specific learning disabilities in children: Clinical features&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=specific-learning-disabilities-in-children-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Specific learning disabilities in children: Evaluation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=specific-learning-disabilities-in-children-educational-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Specific learning disabilities in children: Educational management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definitions-of-specific-learning-disability-and-laws-pertaining-to-learning-disabilities-in-the-united-states\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definitions of specific learning disability and laws pertaining to learning disabilities in the United States&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H546788268\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evaluation and management of learning disabilities (LD) is a primary responsibility of the school system, but it requires input from multiple professionals, including the primary care provider. The primary responsibilities of the primary care provider are to assist in the identification of LD, assure management of LD, address co-occurring conditions, and to provide case management under a medical home model [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-learning-disabilities-in-children-role-of-the-primary-care-provider/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H629395108\" class=\"local\">'Early identification'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=children-and-youth-with-special-health-care-needs#H2009866330\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Children and youth with special health care needs&quot;, section on 'Framework of care'</a>.)</p><p>Secondary roles include serving as a resource to families about community services, advocating for the child's rights and needs at school, serving as a mediator between the family and the school team, and serving as a consultant and resource to the school team. (See <a href=\"#H973143\" class=\"local\">'Resources'</a> below and <a href=\"#H973828\" class=\"local\">'Advocacy and support'</a> below and <a href=\"#H546787514\" class=\"local\">'Mediator'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary roles &ndash; The diagnosis of LD using psychometric tests usually is made by educators <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> psychologists. Nonetheless, the primary care provider's expertise and unique clinical perspective play a vital role in the identification and evaluation of children with LD. A primary role of the pediatric clinician is to help identify the student who may have LD <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> who may need to be evaluated for LD. In addition, the pediatric clinician completes a medical evaluation for co-occurring conditions such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, sleep problems, and seizures, among others. Once identified, the primary care provider should discuss reasons for learning failure with the family and provide information about LD and its co-occurring conditions. (See <a href=\"#H629395108\" class=\"local\">'Early identification'</a> below and <a href=\"#H546787491\" class=\"local\">'Education and counseling'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Primary care providers who have a longstanding relationship with the child and family may be better able to help the family articulate their concerns than educators or clinicians with whom the family is less familiar, thus helping to identify students who may have LD and have not yet been identified by the child's teacher or school team. Primary care providers also may have information that can facilitate the school team's understanding of the child's learning needs (eg, knowledge of psychosocial, cultural, medical, or environmental factors that affect the child's ability to learn), thereby reinforcing the need for formal evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-learning-disabilities-in-children-role-of-the-primary-care-provider/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In addition, the primary care provider can assist the parents with the interpretation of school evaluations and in negotiating the special education system once formal evaluations are completed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-learning-disabilities-in-children-role-of-the-primary-care-provider/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H973828\" class=\"local\">'Advocacy and support'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Finally, the pediatric clinician can help the family understand LD and its co-occurring conditions so that they can seek appropriate services. (See <a href=\"#H629397303\" class=\"local\">'Care coordination'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Secondary roles &ndash; The primary care provider can also play a number of secondary roles in the management of children with disabilities who receive special services at school. These include providing information about <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> referrals to community agencies that provide treatment for the disability and its co-occurring conditions; serving as an advocate for the child vis-&agrave;-vis the school and other community agencies; serving as a mediator between the family and the school team when there are disagreements; and assisting the school team in the delivery of services. (See <a href=\"#H972709\" class=\"local\">'Communicating with the school team'</a> below and <a href=\"#H546787514\" class=\"local\">'Mediator'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H629395108\"><span class=\"h1\">EARLY IDENTIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early identification of learning disabilities (LD) is crucial to providing appropriate interventions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-learning-disabilities-in-children-role-of-the-primary-care-provider/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Because early recognition may affect ultimate outcome, pediatric health care providers should have a low threshold for considering LD in children who are at risk for LD and children who have problems at school (whether the problems are in academic achievement, behavior, attention, or social interaction). The primary care provider can play a critical role when the child's learning problems are overlooked by the family <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> school personnel. LD should be considered if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is parental concern about any school-related problem (eg, behavioral regulation, poor peer interactions, or learning problems)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The child's report card indicates learning difficulty, especially if there is a pattern of learning difficulty consistent with LD</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is a family history of learning problems</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The child has a <span class=\"nowrap\">behavioral/mental</span> health condition</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The child has a history of developmental delay</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The child has a neurologic or genetic condition or history of central nervous system insult (seizure disorders, neurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis complex)</p><p/><p>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=specific-learning-disabilities-in-children-clinical-features#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Specific learning disabilities in children: Clinical features&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H629395580\"><span class=\"h1\">MEDICAL EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Learning disability (LD) does not usually have a defined medical cause. The goal of the medical evaluation is to identify potential medical, neurologic, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> behavioral conditions that may be related to the LD or that may co-occur with the LD. The primary care provider often is already aware of co-occurring behavioral, neurologic, or genetic conditions related to learning failure. If such conditions are present, it is particularly important to ask about learning and school problems during regularly scheduled well-child visits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-learning-disabilities-in-children-role-of-the-primary-care-provider/abstract/1,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9</a>]. The child's report card is a useful source of information about the child's learning abilities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H629395587\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The educational and learning histories are the most important aspects of the medical evaluation, particularly if the child has been followed consistently by the primary care provider and the provider is familiar with the child's medical conditions.</p><p>The chief complaint of the parent or child usually suggests the problem area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-learning-disabilities-in-children-role-of-the-primary-care-provider/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The health care provider should use standard descriptors to further define the type of learning problem (eg, the time that the learning problem was first identified, any improvement or worsening of the problem over time, factors that improved or aggravated the learning problem, etc). Students with learning problems often have impairments in more than one area, including vision, hearing, motor skills, attention and task completion skills, language skills, and social skills. The pediatric clinician should ask about problems in these areas, in addition to asking about problems in formal learning at school.</p><p>The child's performance at school can be measured by report cards, teacher comments, parent observations, and history of academic progress over time. The Vanderbilt teacher questionnaire for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is available through the <a href=\"http://www.nichq.org/childrens-health/adhd/resources/vanderbilt-assessment-scales&amp;token=Pry/hB6qqNiZcgwKU2U2B7iWjC+6JFNWaPXR/3nPYD9yVKOYnzBgfHsiLVDRiuYhzCWHdgEzTHfD51qgHGnG6xKFzKJztmDNau6mQZJg9N8=&amp;TOPIC_ID=15399\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">National Institute for Children's Health Quality</a>. It includes questions about classroom performance and co-occurring conditions, and can be useful in identifying learning difficulty. In the author's clinic, a detailed questionnaire about the student's school performance helps to complete the history when filled out by the classroom teacher (available from <a href=\"https://www.floatinghospital.org/Patient-Care-Services/Departments-and-Services/Center-for-Children-with-Special-Needs/Helpful-Resources/Downloadable-Forms.aspx&amp;token=it0gQNSgVdgWYBWoAuiS7Err15S/IVNCC3Qfjd14hXbKq0D89MdEy0xB1/y0Fj6QJ8ZpeKY6jAVP6SqvmuBGJMVuWBmoDEC1G3V5sqPi3gKwiJunfXgEu9HqIcad2V5aKkdw5BWj4dppqbkShdMDehoOrfMeCBq/cyWTToVpQE9fTvT+Nbark+i5DfHgz+1h&amp;TOPIC_ID=15399\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">the Floating Hospital for Children Center for Children with Special Needs</a>). Rating scales such as the Conners' rating scale [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-learning-disabilities-in-children-role-of-the-primary-care-provider/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], Childhood Behavior Checklist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-learning-disabilities-in-children-role-of-the-primary-care-provider/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], and Behavioral Assessment System for Children, second edition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-learning-disabilities-in-children-role-of-the-primary-care-provider/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>] include pertinent questions about the child's behaviors in the classroom and are also a useful source of information about the student's classroom performance when completed by the classroom teacher.</p><p>It is important to assure that the child has attended school regularly when making an assessment for LD. The likelihood of LD increases if learning failure is associated with certain medical, developmental, and familial factors. Consideration of these factors also informs the treatment plan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-learning-disabilities-in-children-role-of-the-primary-care-provider/abstract/1,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9,10</a>].

The examiner should ask about the age of attainment of various developmental milestones, particularly language milestones (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60900\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60900 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F112970\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef112970 \">figure 1</a>). Past developmental delays can be associated with current learning problems.</p><p>The child's abilities and strengths should be identified, as well as <span class=\"nowrap\">his/her</span> disabilities. One way to access this information is to ask what activities the child enjoys doing or believes <span class=\"nowrap\">him/herself</span> to be good at doing. The child's interests and skills are useful in the development of a treatment plan.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H629395594\"><span class=\"h2\">Examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The physical examination of most children with LD is normal. Abnormalities on physical examination may suggest a particular neurologic or genetic condition that is associated with learning problems (eg, neurofibromatosis, tuberous sclerosis complex, Klinefelter syndrome). However, children with these conditions typically do not present with learning failure as the first sign or symptom. Important aspects of the physical examination of a child in whom LD is a consideration are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53481\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53481 \">table 3</a>).</p><p>Dysmorphic features (ie, major or minor malformations) may suggest a genetic or congenital condition that is associated with learning problems (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=birth-defects-epidemiology-types-and-patterns#H4131797223\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Birth defects: Epidemiology, types, and patterns&quot;, section on 'Malformations'</a>). The incidence of minor malformations is increased among children with LD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-learning-disabilities-in-children-role-of-the-primary-care-provider/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, no specific pattern of minor anomalies is pathognomonic for LD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-learning-disabilities-in-children-role-of-the-primary-care-provider/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>The child's participation in the history-taking and the physical examination provides an opportunity to review his or her capacity to follow instructions and to use language to answer questions and participate in a conversation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H629395601\"><span class=\"h2\">Informal testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pediatric health care provider can perform informal testing to review developmental functions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60900\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60900 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F112970\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef112970 \">figure 1</a>) and to identify specific areas for further testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-learning-disabilities-in-children-role-of-the-primary-care-provider/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Testing can also help in assessing basic knowledge and mental status. A formal battery of psychoeducational tests is usually administered by a psychologist or educator, but some primary care providers may use developmental assessment tools to add to the information that they have gathered. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=specific-learning-disabilities-in-children-evaluation#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Specific learning disabilities in children: Evaluation&quot;, section on 'Psychometric tests'</a>.)</p><p>There are many components to successful learning. When LD is suspected, the primary care provider should focus on the specific learning skills and learning deficits that are characteristic of LD (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76081\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76081 \">table 1</a>). However, other behaviors or learning difficulties, such as poor attention span or problems socializing, may be the signal for LD <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> may co-occur with the LD. Participation in structured developmental tasks can help the pediatric health care provider look more closely at the child's:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Capacity to focus attention</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Language and memory function (ability to understand, remember, and carry out instructions)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Expressive language skills (ability to use vocabulary and grammar correctly)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pragmatic language skills (use of nonverbal communication skills such as facial expressions, gestures, or changes in tone of voice; ability to carry on a conversation by providing appropriate responses and by showing appropriate turn-taking; being able to sequence sentences into a logical narrative)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coordination skills</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Specific tasks of reading, writing, or math (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F76081\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76081 \">table 1</a>)</p><p/><p>The pediatric health provider can incorporate some routine questions about phonologic skills, reading, and language skills during office encounters with young children to assess language and literacy skills (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F69787\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69787 \">table 4</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Phonologic awareness skills &ndash; Preschool and kindergarten children should be able to identify and provide words that rhyme (&quot;Tell me what rhymes with 'mat.'&quot;).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Grade one children should be able to delete the beginning sound of a word (&quot;Say 'fireman' without saying 'man.'&quot;, &quot;If you take away the 'h' sound from 'hat,' what do you get?&quot;) and replace the beginning sound of a word with a new letter (&quot;If you take the 't' sound in 'take' and replace it with an 'm,' what do you get?&quot;).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early phonics skills &ndash; Kindergarten children should be able to identify letters and some of their sounds (sound-symbol relationships or phonics skills).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">By the end of grade one, students should be able to read (decode) novel three and four letter words. Phonics is largely mastered by the end of grade two. In grade two, children can show phonetic spelling skills, producing phonetically correct words even if the words are spelled incorrectly.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Late phonics skills &ndash; By the end of grade three, all phonics skills in the English language should be mastered, and the child should be able to read (decode) <span class=\"nowrap\">fluently/smoothly</span>. The child should also be able to read with comprehension. By the end of grade three, spelling errors are less and less common in children who are learning successfully.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Language skills &ndash; After age four, articulation should be 100 percent intelligible. By kindergarten or grade one, children should speak English fluently and without grammatical errors. Although grammatical errors amongst children exposed to another language at home can occur after this age, especially if exposed to incorrectly spoken English, children exposed to another language at home typically should have mastered English by this age as well. Review of language skills is especially useful because language difficulty typically precedes problems in reading and writing.</p><p/><p>Inability to demonstrate the language and literacy skills listed above can signal potential <span class=\"nowrap\">reading/writing</span> disorders. All children with problems with phonics have difficulty in both reading and writing. At all ages, difficulty pronouncing basic sounds, mispronunciation of long or complicated words, halting speech, laborious and slow reading or writing, poor spelling, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the need for extra time in reading <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> to take tests are important indicators of a potential reading disorder (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F54976\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54976 \">table 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F82083\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82083 \">table 6</a>). Although additional evaluation is necessary, the primary care provider should have a high suspicion for a reading disorder and a low threshold for referral. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reading-difficulty-in-children-clinical-features-and-evaluation#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reading difficulty in children: Clinical features and evaluation&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p>Routine questions about math skills may facilitate early identification of math LD. Early math skills include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Number sense &ndash; By kindergarten, children understand that things can be counted and that some numbers are bigger than others. They understand concepts such as <span class=\"nowrap\">&quot;more/less&quot;</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">&quot;bigger/smaller</span>.&quot; They know that numbers are counted in a specific order.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Math facts or math calculations &ndash; In grade one, children know that numbers can be added and learn specific addition and subtraction procedures. By the end of grade two, they understand many math facts related to addition and subtraction, and can recite many of them by memorization. Multiplication and division skills are learned later.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Math fluency &ndash; Math fluency refers to the quick retrieval of math facts. Math fluency is variable and is best assessed through formal measures.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H629395608\"><span class=\"h2\">Ancillary medical testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no specific laboratory tests that are especially important or useful in the evaluation of LD unless indicated by the medical history <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> physical examination.

The primary care provider can provide advocacy and support for children and families of children with learning difficulty by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Helping them to organize their thoughts before communicating with the school team or by speaking to the school team on their behalf. Examples include: helping the family to organize their questions and requests before an individualized education program (IEP) meeting; communicating the family's concerns on their behalf during a telephone conversation with the school team; attending an IEP meeting with the family or suggesting that a family friend, another family member, or a hired advocate attend the meeting with them. The author of this topic review sometimes uses the office encounter to conduct a telephone meeting with the school team with the family present.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The following features of the IEP in a child with LD merit review with the family:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Educational objectives &ndash; Educational objectives should address all areas of suspected disability. In addition, educational objectives should be measurable. Without measurable objectives, it is not possible to assess the student's progress. In the case of LD, educational objectives include areas such as improving phonologic skills (identifying and producing all of the sounds of the English language); phonics skills (identify how sounds of the English language are related to symbols [letters]); spelling skills; reading and writing fluency; as well as reading comprehension and written expression. Educational objectives for math can include improving number sense, improving math calculations, and improving fluency in math calculations, among others.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Availability of appropriately trained staff to address all areas of suspected disability &ndash; In the case of LD, the teacher must be qualified to <span class=\"nowrap\">remediate/improve</span> reading, writing, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> math skills.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Staff-to-student ratio &ndash; Small group instruction is needed to remediate LD.

In such situations, the primary care provider can start by determining whether the family has a correct understanding of their legal rights and whether the school team has fulfilled the procedural safeguards required by law (eg, under the IDEA, an evaluation has to be made available at public expense and upon parent request; the evaluation has to be completed within 60 days, etc). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definitions-of-specific-learning-disability-and-laws-pertaining-to-learning-disabilities-in-the-united-states#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definitions of specific learning disability and laws pertaining to learning disabilities in the United States&quot;, section on 'Laws affecting the education of students with disabilities'</a>.)</p><p>Next, it is important to understand the family's disagreement and why they believe that a service for their child is needed. Following this, it is often helpful to call a member of the child's school team, such as the special education coordinator or the school principal, to learn about why the conflict may have arisen. Sometimes, sharing perspectives between the family and the school team is sufficient to help each party see &quot;eye to eye.&quot; At other times, when the family has a valid reason for disagreement, they may need to be referred to advocacy services or other clinicians who may be more experienced in managing situations of conflict, such as a developmental behavioral pediatrician, a child psychologist or psychiatrist who understands the needs of children who require special education services, or an advocate or other professional at a <a href=\"http://www.parentcenterhub.org/parent-centers/rptacs/&amp;token=O0zY8EHXbEbM8l7cyk/BcZP2mNmjkuIQJANMuAIooEnDreEmeGJdyVUAvD7+rQqLMP+gXWdor3XCtNtWJgHMLQ==&amp;TOPIC_ID=15399\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">regional parent technical assistance center</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F57599\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57599 \">table 9</a>).

Pediatric clinicians have much to offer to school professionals and can help improve services for students when they communicate effectively with the school team. School teams typically value the input of clinicians and other medical personnel. However, they can also experience significant frustration in their interactions with medical personnel, specifically when medical personnel do not communicate with schools [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-learning-disabilities-in-children-role-of-the-primary-care-provider/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. One of the major reasons that schools hire a pediatric consultant is to assure effective communication between the school team and the child's health care provider [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-learning-disabilities-in-children-role-of-the-primary-care-provider/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. This speaks to the importance of communication that occurs directly between pediatric clinicians and the child's school team members.</p><p>All communication between the primary care provider and members of the school team should occur with the knowledge and agreement of the family. The child psychiatry literature offers guidelines and suggestions for how to consult with school teams, which can help inform how the primary care provider should consult with school teams [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-learning-disabilities-in-children-role-of-the-primary-care-provider/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. Effective communication with school teams improves with practice and over time.</p><p>When communicating with schools, personally or in writing, it is important for the primary care provider to understand the type of information most needed by schools; the legal weight of recommendations provided by a pediatric clinician when the school makes service delivery decisions; and the circumscribed nature of therapeutic services in school settings. These aspects of communication are described in the following sections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H972939\"><span class=\"h3\">Medical information</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>About medical conditions &ndash; The type of information that is most useful to schools concerns diagnoses that they are not able to make on their own (eg, medical or mental health conditions, such as epilepsy, attention deficit disorder, autism, etc), and information about the effects of the condition(s) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> its treatment(s) on the child's ability to learn. A major concern for many school professionals is the wish to avoid harming the student, either through action or inaction related to the student's medical or mental health conditions. The pediatric clinician can help address these concerns, but personal communication with the school team may be required to assure that the correct questions are answered.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>About prescriptions &ndash; The school team may require explicit or prescriptive information from the pediatric clinician. This typically applies to the administration of medications or other medical interventions at school, rather than prescriptions for rehabilitative services. (See <a href=\"#H546787549\" class=\"local\">'Services at school: Educational versus rehabilitative'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">To assure that medications or other interventions are administered or used appropriately, personal communication with the school nurse may be required. Subspecialists may need to provide information for certain interventions (eg, orthotic devices, ventilators, etc). Specific guidelines about the use of medications in schools are available from the AAP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-learning-disabilities-in-children-role-of-the-primary-care-provider/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Of note, the IDEA specifically prohibits any requirement that parents seek the use of medications before evaluations or services are provided by the school [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-learning-disabilities-in-children-role-of-the-primary-care-provider/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>About the student's capacity to participate at school &ndash; The school team may require information about potential effects of the student's medical condition(s) or treatment(s) on the student's performance in the classroom or other school-related activities. This information may need to be very explicit in order for the student to receive the necessary evaluations <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> services. It may include comments about the student's capacity to navigate the school environment; capacity to remain seated for the duration of the school day; capacity to follow school rules and classroom routines; ability to participate in classroom discussions; capacity to focus; capacity for peer relations; ability to complete classroom work and homework, etc. Pediatric health care providers are not necessarily trained to think about the functional or educational needs of students in school settings and may not be certain about how to describe the functional impact of the child's condition on his or her performance at school or to make recommendations that reflect all of the student's needs. In such situations, it is best for the pediatric clinician to speak directly with classroom staff and then make an estimate about how the student's medical or behavioral conditions might be related to classroom performance. A convenient way to obtain this information is to have the classroom teacher describe his or her concerns about the student's performance in class or to complete a questionnaire about school function. The questionnaire used in the author's clinic is available from <a href=\"https://www.floatinghospital.org/Patient-Care-Services/Departments-and-Services/Center-for-Children-with-Special-Needs/Helpful-Resources/Downloadable-Forms.aspx&amp;token=it0gQNSgVdgWYBWoAuiS7Err15S/IVNCC3Qfjd14hXbKq0D89MdEy0xB1/y0Fj6QJ8ZpeKY6jAVP6SqvmuBGJMVuWBmoDEC1G3V5sqPi3gKwiJunfXgEu9HqIcad2V5aKkdw5BWj4dppqbkShdMDehoOrfMeCBq/cyWTToVpQE9fTvT+Nbark+i5DfHgz+1h&amp;TOPIC_ID=15399\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">the Floating Hospital for Children Center for Children with Special Needs</a>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>About testing or services needed &ndash; Based on the information gathered about the student, the pediatric clinician can make recommendations for testing (eg, screening evaluation for mental health conditions, <span class=\"nowrap\">speech/language</span> testing, occupational therapy testing, educational evaluation, etc) or make recommendations for specific kinds of services (eg, behavior management, counseling, instruction in social interactions, LD instruction, etc).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In order to maximize the chances that educational recommendations made by a pediatric clinician will be considered thoughtfully, the pediatric clinician must have information about the child's performance at school, either in the form of a questionnaire about school performance (eg, the school questionnaire available from <a href=\"https://www.floatinghospital.org/Patient-Care-Services/Departments-and-Services/Center-for-Children-with-Special-Needs/Helpful-Resources/Downloadable-Forms.aspx&amp;token=it0gQNSgVdgWYBWoAuiS7Err15S/IVNCC3Qfjd14hXbKq0D89MdEy0xB1/y0Fj6QJ8ZpeKY6jAVP6SqvmuBGJMVuWBmoDEC1G3V5sqPi3gKwiJunfXgEu9HqIcad2V5aKkdw5BWj4dppqbkShdMDehoOrfMeCBq/cyWTToVpQE9fTvT+Nbark+i5DfHgz+1h&amp;TOPIC_ID=15399\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">the Floating Hospital for Children Center for Children with Special Needs</a>, Vanderbilt Assessment Scales ) or by having a conversation with a member of the school team. Recommendations made by the pediatric clinician following a conversation with a school team member are more likely to reflect the student's actual needs and to be considered favorably by the school. When recommendations are provided in writing, the author typically includes a statement, such as, &quot;the following recommendations were discussed with the student's school team on (mention date),&quot; to show the reader of the document that the school team's perspective was considered before the recommendations were made. This type of thoughtfulness is highly valued by schools.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H972716\"><span class=\"h3\">Written documentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Families may ask the primary care provider to provide written documentation of their child's diagnosis (or diagnoses) or a &quot;prescription&quot; for education or related services at school. Requests for diagnostic information may be requested by the school as a routine.</p><p>Sharing diagnostic information is typically a straightforward process. However, it is helpful if the primary care provider reminds the family that having a specific diagnosis or a disability does not guarantee the provision of services: It is the functional impairment of the disability that determines whether services are provided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-learning-disabilities-in-children-role-of-the-primary-care-provider/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H546787542\" class=\"local\">'Service delivery decisions: Primary care provider's role'</a> below.)</p><p>It is helpful for the pediatric clinician to understand the context in which the information is being requested. As an example, the family may request a &quot;prescription&quot; or letter from the primary care provider making a request for specific evaluations or service. Such a request may be related to conflict between the family and the school about service delivery decisions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-learning-disabilities-in-children-role-of-the-primary-care-provider/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>When specific recommendations for testing or services are sought by the family, the pediatric clinician can call the school to find out why the letter or prescription is being sought and to find out what information or recommendations would be most useful to the school team. Communication with the school increases the chance that the written documentation will result in action on the part of the school. In some cases, failure to communicate with the school can inadvertently reinforce conflicts between the family and the school [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-learning-disabilities-in-children-role-of-the-primary-care-provider/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Sometimes, verbal communication obviates the need for written documentation, simply because the pediatric clinician has spoken on behalf of the family and has helped the school team to understand the family's needs or concerns. In most cases, written documentation from the pediatric clinician is more useful to the school team and received more positively when there has been a prior conversation with a member of the school team.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H546787542\"><span class=\"h3\">Service delivery decisions: Primary care provider's role</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The law requires schools to make service delivery decisions collaboratively. This means that schools make decisions by &quot;considering&quot; (a legal term found in the IDEA) the input of outside providers (including the primary care provider), along with the input of school team members and the family [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-learning-disabilities-in-children-role-of-the-primary-care-provider/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. No single clinician, teacher, or administrator is allowed to determine how services are to be delivered. This process, when conducted successfully, allows the school team to consider options for service delivery that are therapeutically and educationally sound but that also are consistent with the school ecology and resources as a whole. That being said, service delivery decisions are sometimes made on the basis of the services available at the school, not on the basis of the services needed by the student. In such cases, input from the pediatric clinician that reveals an understanding of the student's needs at school can carry significant weight in service delivery decisions at school.</p><p>Schools sometimes appear to make service delivery decisions contingent upon the pediatric clinician's input. Families and even school teams sometimes believe that the pediatric clinician's input is a requirement for the delivery of certain kinds of services at school (eg, specialized services for a student with a diagnosis of autism or supportive services for a student with ADHD). However, neither Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act nor the IDEA supports the practice of withholding services until a diagnosis is &quot;proven&quot; to exist or until a health care provider's input is received. First, schools cannot require the family to use insurance benefits in order to obtain the information that the school needs to make service decisions. Second, although a handicapping condition is a prerequisite for the delivery of services under both Section 504 and the IDEA, it is the functional impairment that determines the services provided, not the diagnosis or condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-learning-disabilities-in-children-role-of-the-primary-care-provider/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. This functional impairment is evaluated by the school team, not by the pediatric clinician. Schools have great legal latitude in providing services to students who may need them. Education and disability rights laws include many provisions to assure successful service delivery to student without the input of any outside clinicians.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H546787549\"><span class=\"h3\">Services at school: Educational versus rehabilitative</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Schools provide therapeutic services that are related to the student's education [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-learning-disabilities-in-children-role-of-the-primary-care-provider/abstract/6,40,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,40,51</a>]. They do not offer therapeutic services in a rehabilitative mode of care. Medical services and interventions that are offered in schools are circumscribed to assure that the student can receive a &quot;meaningful benefit&quot; from his or her individualized educational program under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/specific-learning-disabilities-in-children-role-of-the-primary-care-provider/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>] <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> to prevent discrimination by providing equal access to an education program under the Americans with Disabilities Act (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F80545\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80545 \">table 10</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definitions-of-specific-learning-disability-and-laws-pertaining-to-learning-disabilities-in-the-united-states#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definitions of specific learning disability and laws pertaining to learning disabilities in the United States&quot;, section on 'Laws affecting the education of students with disabilities'</a>.)</p><p>Thus, for example, physical therapy and occupational therapy services are provided to assure that the student can navigate successfully the school environment, remain seated and participate in classroom discussion, and complete any of the other fine or gross motor tasks required in the school setting. Similarly, <span class=\"nowrap\">speech/language</span> services are provided so that the student can participate in classroom discussions, complete reading and writing tasks, and interact with peers. Providing services and supports to the student is geared specifically to supporting those activities required at school. Given the many tasks required by students in school, students often do receive services that provide rehabilitative benefits since the distinction between &quot;rehabilitative&quot; and &quot;educational&quot; is not always clear. However, the pediatric clinician should understand that rehabilitation is not the intent of education or civil rights laws. Some rehabilitative services can and should be accessed through the child's health insurance plan, allowing the child to focus on his or her education while in the school setting.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H629397728\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The primary responsibilities of the primary care provider in the care of the child with learning disability (LD) are to assist in the diagnosis and management of LD and its co-occurring conditions, and to provide case management under a medical home model.
