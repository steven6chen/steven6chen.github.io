Yeast-associated endophthalmitis is usually endogenous (secondary to fungemia), and treatment is often successful, whereas mold endophthalmitis is usually exogenous (occurring after trauma, surgery, or keratomycosis) and often results in permanent loss of vision.</p><p>The epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis of fungal endophthalmitis will be reviewed here.

In most cases, the highly vascular choroid is seeded first. As a consequence, endogenous fungal endophthalmitis often presents with choroiditis or chorioretinitis (infection localized to the choroid or the choroid and retina), with minimal inflammation in the vitreous or aqueous. As the infection worsens, marked vitritis develops and the aqueous may also become involved.</p><p>The distinction between fungal choroiditis or chorioretinitis and endophthalmitis (ie, with marked vitritis) is important for making decisions about treatment, and we will specify the degree of involvement in the discussion below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H79279581\"><span class=\"h2\">Exogenous fungal endophthalmitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Exogenous fungal endophthalmitis means that the infection was introduced from the &quot;outside,&quot; either by eye surgery, eye trauma, or extension of fungal infection of the cornea (termed &quot;fungal keratitis&quot; or &quot;keratomycosis&quot;).

In a review of 51 patients with endogenous fungal endophthalmitis in Florida, 75 percent were due to yeast (95 percent of which were <em>Candida</em> species) and only 25 percent were due to molds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fungal-endophthalmitis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In tropical regions, however, most cases of fungal endophthalmitis are due to molds and are usually exogenous in origin.

Other yeasts, such as <em>Cryptococcus</em>, can also cause endogenous endophthalmitis, but these cases are uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fungal-endophthalmitis/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. Although all species of <em>Candida</em> have been reported to cause endogenous endophthalmitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fungal-endophthalmitis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], the most common is <em>C. albicans</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fungal-endophthalmitis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In a review that included 36 cases of endogenous <em>Candida</em> endophthalmitis, 33 (92 percent) were due to <em>C. albicans</em> and the remainder were due to <em>C. tropicalis</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fungal-endophthalmitis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Other risk factors for hospital-acquired <em>Candida</em> endophthalmitis include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-parenteral-nutrition-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">total parenteral nutrition</a>, broad-spectrum antibiotics, recent abdominal surgery, neutropenia, and glucocorticoid therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fungal-endophthalmitis/abstract/6,8-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8-12</a>]. Risk factors for candidemia are discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-candidemia-in-adults#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and pathogenesis of candidemia in adults&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a>.)</p><p>In hospitalized patients with candidemia, the overall prevalence of ocular involvement has varied from 2 to 26 percent, and the subset of cases with significant vitritis (endophthalmitis) has ranged from 0 to 6 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fungal-endophthalmitis/abstract/7,11,13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,11,13-16</a>]. Excluding nonspecific retinal lesions decreases the reported incidence of endophthalmitis, whereas performing repeated eye examinations of patients with candidemia who have a negative initial examination can increase the number of identified patients. Large prospective trials comparing various antifungal agents for candidemia have reported similar prevalence rates. In a trial that included 370 patients with candidemia, 40 patients (11 percent) had ocular involvement, 6 of whom (1.6 percent) had significant vitritis (endophthalmitis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fungal-endophthalmitis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. An additional 20 patients had less specific findings but were thought to have possible ocular involvement. Of the total of 60 patients, 49 had findings consistent with ocular involvement at baseline and an additional 11 patients developed ocular abnormalities during treatment. The duration of candidemia was slightly longer in patients with ocular involvement (median 4 days, range 1 to 18 days) compared with those without (median 3 days, range 1 to 26 days), a difference that was statistically significant.</p><p>In outpatients who do not have a history of recent hospitalization or an indwelling central venous catheter, intravenous drug use is the major risk factor for endogenous <em>Candida</em> endophthalmitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fungal-endophthalmitis/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Over a seven-year period (2001 to 2007) at an eye and ear hospital in Australia, 19 of 27 patients (70 percent) presenting with endogenous fungal endophthalmitis were intravenous drug users [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fungal-endophthalmitis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Of these 19 patients, 13 had positive intraocular cultures and all grew <em>Candida </em>species (<em>C. albicans</em> in seven, <em>C. dubliniensis</em> in four, and <em>C. tropicalis</em> in two). The source of the <em>Candida</em> in such cases may be oral flora. In some cases in this series and others, the drug injected intravenously was sublingual or oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=buprenorphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">buprenorphine</a> that had been diluted with water. The buprenorphine was being used to treat the drug addiction, and, in some cases, the user admitted to removing the partially dissolved tablet from his or her mouth prior to diluting and injecting it [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fungal-endophthalmitis/abstract/17,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,19,20</a>]. In other cases, oral flora may be introduced when the drug user licks the needle prior to intravenous injection. This practice appears to be common; one study from New York City found that one-third of the 40 interviewed drug users acknowledged licking their needles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fungal-endophthalmitis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. An unusual source of <em>Candida</em> occurred in the 1980s, when there was a large outbreak of <em>Candida</em> endophthalmitis among injection drug users who used brown heroin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fungal-endophthalmitis/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. This type of heroin requires an acidic diluent, and the lemon juice used for this purpose was thought to be the major source of the <em>Candida</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fungal-endophthalmitis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2726019\"><span class=\"h3\">Exogenous Candida endophthalmitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Exogenous <em>Candida</em> endophthalmitis is rare. In a series of all patients treated for exogenous fungal endophthalmitis at an eye hospital in Florida over a 16-year period, <em>Candida</em> species accounted for only 6 of the 41 cases (15 percent), whereas molds caused 35 cases (85 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fungal-endophthalmitis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Among the six <em>Candida</em> cases, three occurred after surgery (corneal transplant and intraocular lens [IOL] implant exchange in two, cataract surgery in one), two occurred after trauma, and one occurred as an extension of keratomycosis. The time from surgery or keratitis to the diagnosis of endophthalmitis was long (five weeks to six months), but very short in those cases due to trauma (one day). Some exogenous <em>Candida</em> endophthalmitis cases have followed corneal transplantation, in which donor-to-host transmission occurred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fungal-endophthalmitis/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. These patients presented with endophthalmitis acutely (ie, one day) following the corneal transplant.</p><p>In a series of 113 patients with fungal endophthalmitis in India, 90 percent of cases were exogenous, caused either by surgery (53 patients) or trauma (48 patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fungal-endophthalmitis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. As in the series from Florida, the majority of the exogenous cases were due to molds. Twelve (23 percent) of the 52 culture-positive exogenous cases were due to <em>Candida</em> spp, and 75 percent followed eye surgery, including cataract surgery. <em>C. tropicalis</em> (five cases) and <em>C. albicans</em> (four cases) were the most common species.</p><p>All species of <em>Candida </em>have been described as causing exogenous endophthalmitis, but <em>C. parapsilosis</em> has been commonly reported in postsurgical outbreaks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fungal-endophthalmitis/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>]. The most likely reason for this is that <em>C. parapsilosis</em> has a high propensity to survive in irrigation fluids and prosthetic materials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fungal-endophthalmitis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The largest reported outbreak of <em>C. parapsilosis</em> endophthalmitis, involving 13 patients, was traced to an ophthalmic irrigating solution that was contaminated during the manufacturing process and was used during IOL implantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fungal-endophthalmitis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2726026\"><span class=\"h2\">Mold endophthalmitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mold endophthalmitis is rare in the United States except in hot, humid regions, such as Florida, where molds account for 6 percent of all culture-positive endophthalmitis cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fungal-endophthalmitis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

A review of 86 cases of endogenous <em>Aspergillus</em> endophthalmitis published in the English language literature from 1949 to 2001 noted that 27 percent occurred in intravenous drug users, 23 percent in solid organ transplant recipients, 17 percent in patients with chronic lung disease, and 43 percent in patients who had been treated with glucocorticoids previously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fungal-endophthalmitis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The predominant species was <em>Aspergillus fumigatus</em>, but <em>A. flavus</em> also occurred commonly and was strongly linked to intravenous drug use.</p><p>In a retrospective study at a cancer center in Texas between 1991 and 2007, among 15 patients with mold endophthalmitis, all had underlying hematologic malignancies and over one-half had undergone hematopoietic cell transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fungal-endophthalmitis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. <em>Fusarium</em> spp (five cases), <em>Aspergillus</em> spp (four), and <em>Scedosporium</em> spp (four) caused 87 percent of cases; the remaining two cases were caused by <em>Mucor</em> spp and <em>Rhizomucor</em> spp.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H522538044\"><span class=\"h3\">Exogenous mold endophthalmitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mold endophthalmitis is usually exogenous, occurring as a result of extension of keratomycosis, eye surgery, or penetrating ocular trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fungal-endophthalmitis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In a series of exogenous fungal endophthalmitis cases seen at an eye hospital in Florida over 16 years, keratitis accounted for nearly one-half of the 35 cases of mold endophthalmitis (17 cases), whereas eye surgery (10 cases) and eye trauma (8 cases) each accounted for approximately 25 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fungal-endophthalmitis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>In cases that occur as an extension of fungal keratitis, the aqueous humor is nearly always involved first. The microbiology reflects that of keratomycosis, with <em>Fusarium</em> and <em>Aspergillus</em> spp being the most common etiologies. In the Florida study, 13 of 17 keratitis-related mold endophthalmitis cases were due to <em>Fusarium</em> spp, with four occurring between 2004 and 2006 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fungal-endophthalmitis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Some of these cases may reflect the international outbreak of <em>Fusarium</em> keratitis (over 250 cases) that occurred between 2004 and 2006. This outbreak was linked to the use of a specific lens solution and poor contact lens care; one report of a subset of patients from this outbreak noted that 6 percent of patients developed endophthalmitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fungal-endophthalmitis/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>].

When it does occur, it usually presents subacutely rather than acutely, in contrast with most cases of bacterial postoperative endophthalmitis, which present acutely. Two large series of acute (&lt;6 weeks) postcataract endophthalmitis in Florida and France, totaling 173 cases, reported that all cases were due to bacteria: there were no cases of acute fungal endophthalmitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fungal-endophthalmitis/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. The onset of symptoms and diagnosis are often delayed; in one review that included 10 cases of postoperative exogenous mold endophthalmitis, 60 percent presented two months or more after eye surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fungal-endophthalmitis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>In tropical regions of the world, postoperative mold endophthalmitis is more common and may present more acutely. In two retrospective reviews of the microbiology of postoperative endophthalmitis in India, molds caused 22 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fungal-endophthalmitis/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>]. In a series from India of 27 postcataract fungal endophthalmitis cases (22 with mold endophthalmitis), over 80 percent presented within four weeks of surgery. <em>Aspergillus</em> was the major etiology in this series and in others.</p><p>Some postsurgical endophthalmitis cases have occurred in the setting of nosocomial outbreaks, as illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One compounding pharmacy in Florida was associated with two concurrent outbreaks of fungal endophthalmitis in nine states, affecting 45 patients (47 cases) during 2011 to 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fungal-endophthalmitis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. The two outbreaks together represent the largest reported outbreak of infectious endophthalmitis in the United States. Twenty-one patients developed <em>Fusarium incarnatum-equiseti</em> endophthalmitis after receiving an intraocular injection of compounded Brilliant Blue dye, used off label to stain epiretinal membranes during retinal surgeries. Twenty-six cases of <em>Bipolaris hawaiiensis</em> endophthalmitis developed after 24 patients received intravitreal injections of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a>; two patients received injections in each eye and developed bilateral <em>Bipolaris</em> endophthalmitis.

Unless there is concomitant systemic fungal infection, patients do not have fever, chills, or leukocytosis.</p><p>Endophthalmitis is suspected clinically based upon the patient's presenting complaints, risk factors (eg, recent indwelling central catheter or intravenous drug use for endogenous endophthalmitis, eye trauma, or surgery for exogenous endophthalmitis), and the ophthalmic examination. (See <a href=\"#H79280403\" class=\"local\">'Ophthalmic examination'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H535100592\"><span class=\"h2\">Endogenous fungal endophthalmitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the majority of patients have unilateral eye involvement, both eyes can be affected. Symptoms of vision loss may develop days to weeks after the fungemia. There is often minimal pain until the infection is advanced.</p><p>If the eye was seeded by transient fungemia that infected no other organs, the patient may be systemically well at the time of presentation with eye symptoms, have a normal white blood count, and have negative blood cultures. This is often the case in outpatients with endogenous yeast or mold endophthalmitis due to intravenous drug use. Similarly, candidemia may be transient in patients with indwelling central venous catheters in which the organism seeds the eye but no other organs. Such patients have no evidence of systemic <em>Candida</em> infection at the time of presentation with eye symptoms, and the diagnosis of <em>Candida</em> endophthalmitis may be delayed. In a retrospective review of 15 patients with endogenous <em>Candida</em> endophthalmitis, 11 of whom had had an indwelling venous catheter, the average time from symptom onset to treatment was two months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fungal-endophthalmitis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. In patients with risk factors for transient fungemia (eg, intravenous drug use, recent indwelling central venous catheter), endogenous fungal endophthalmitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with posterior uveitis or panuveitis.</p><p>In contrast, hospitalized patients who develop endogenous fungal endophthalmitis are typically very ill. They may have candidemia from indwelling central venous catheters or have fungemia related to immunosuppression. The eye infection is often clinically silent at first, and, in addition, hospitalized patients with fungemia may be too ill to complain of their symptoms. As a consequence, endophthalmitis may be missed unless patients with fungemia are examined by an ophthalmologist.</p><p>In an autopsy study of 85 orthotopic liver transplant recipients, <em>Aspergillus</em> endophthalmitis was noted in six patients (7 percent), only one of whom was diagnosed with endophthalmitis before death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fungal-endophthalmitis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Fourteen patients (17 percent) had invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, and 10 (12 percent) had disseminated disease. The eyes were the second most common site of infection. Two patients had eye involvement as the only nonpulmonary site of infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H535100623\"><span class=\"h2\">Exogenous fungal endophthalmitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with exogenous fungal endophthalmitis, the onset of symptoms occurs after a variable period of time. A large series from India found that the average time to presentation was 7 days in 48 posttraumatic fungal endophthalmitis cases and 20 days in 53 postoperative cases, although a significant percentage presented within 48 hours (46 and 21 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fungal-endophthalmitis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Only 2 percent of posttraumatic cases but 11 percent of postoperative cases presented more than four weeks after trauma or surgery.</p><p>In a series from Florida, 10 patients with posttraumatic fungal endophthalmitis developed symptoms an average of 1.8 months after trauma (range one day to six months), and 18 patients with keratomycosis developed endophthalmitis four days to six months after the initial corneal ulcer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fungal-endophthalmitis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H79280403\"><span class=\"h1\">OPHTHALMIC EXAMINATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ophthalmic examination reflects the endogenous or exogenous origin of infection:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In endogenous endophthalmitis, the cornea is usually normal and there may be minimal inflammation in the anterior segment of the eye. Initially, the findings may be primarily in the posterior segment of the eye.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In endogenous <em>Candida</em> endophthalmitis, chorioretinitis may be the only finding initially. The classic findings of chorioretinal involvement are focal, white, infiltrative, often mound-like lesions on the retina (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F58685\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58685 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F73575\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73575 \">picture 2</a>). When vitreous extension occurs, a vitreal haze is present (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F52795\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52795 \">picture 3</a>); sometimes, fluffy white balls or &quot;snowballs&quot; or a &quot;string of pearls&quot; in the vitreous are noted (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F73318\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73318 \">picture 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fungal-endophthalmitis/abstract/8,9,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9,11</a>]. The degree of vitreous inflammation is graded on a 0 to 4 scale. Inflammation may also extend to the aqueous, where the same scale of inflammation applies. With marked inflammation, the white blood cells in the aqueous may settle out in the bottom as a hypopyon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F59911\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59911 \">picture 5</a>) or form an inflammatory membrane within the anterior chamber.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In endogenous mold endophthalmitis, the initial infection may appear as a choroidal or subretinal mass or as white lesions in the posterior vitreous. There may be significant vitritis and typically there are clumps or &quot;fluff balls&quot; rather than a diffuse, homogenous vitritis. Inflammation may extend to the aqueous.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In exogenous fungal endophthalmitis due to trauma, the initial surface injury may be apparent. The intraocular inflammation may have a clumped rather than diffuse appearance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F60487\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60487 \">picture 6</a>). In postoperative fungal endophthalmitis, there may be white blood cells and &quot;flare&quot; (protein) in the anterior chamber and keratitic precipitates (clumps of white blood cells) on the corneal endothelium and anterior surface of the lens implant, if present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fungal-endophthalmitis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. A hypopyon may be present (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F59911\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59911 \">picture 5</a>). If extension to the vitreous has occurred, there may be vitritis. The view of the retina may be obscured by the intraocular inflammation. In cases of exogenous mold endophthalmitis that occur as an extension of corneal infection (keratomycosis), slit lamp examination will demonstrate the corneal infiltrate and also may reveal filamentous strands extending into the aqueous from the back of the involved cornea. There may be a hypopyon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F59911\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59911 \">picture 5</a>) and, in some cases, there may be dense, white, clumped material in the anterior chamber.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27883777\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1866834\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach to diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endophthalmitis is suspected clinically based on the patient's presenting complaints, risk factors for fungal endophthalmitis (eg, intravenous drug use, recent indwelling central venous catheter), and the ophthalmic examination (see <a href=\"#H27883763\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H79280403\" class=\"local\">'Ophthalmic examination'</a> above). The 2016 Infectious Diseases Society of America guidelines for the treatment of candidiasis recommend that all patients in whom candidemia is documented should have a dilated retinal examination, preferably by an ophthalmologist, within the first week following diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fungal-endophthalmitis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. In patients who are neutropenic, we favor a second ophthalmologic examination after recovery from neutropenia.</p><p>In a 2007 review of 100 patients with candidemia, only 80 underwent an ophthalmic examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fungal-endophthalmitis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Ophthalmic examination was much more likely to occur when an infectious diseases consultation was obtained (89 versus 54 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fungal-endophthalmitis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Blood cultures should be obtained from <strong>all</strong> patients with suspected endogenous endophthalmitis. (See <a href=\"#H27883806\" class=\"local\">'Blood cultures'</a> below.)</p><p>To establish the diagnosis of fungal endophthalmitis, samples of the vitreous <span class=\"nowrap\">(and/or</span> aqueous, if primarily involved) may be obtained by an ophthalmologist and submitted for stains and cultures. Such sampling is especially important for diagnosis in patients who present with acute or subacute intraocular inflammation of unknown etiology and who have eye findings consistent with fungal endophthalmitis but in whom blood cultures are negative. Obtaining intraocular samples may not be necessary for diagnosis in other cases of fungal endophthalmitis, such as in patients with documented candidemia and funduscopic findings typical of <em>Candida</em> chorioretinitis or in patients with keratomycosis of known fungal etiology whose infection has extended into the aqueous.</p><p>Any time the vitreous (or aqueous) is sampled, material should be sent for stains and cultures. In patients in whom the diagnosis of fungal endophthalmitis is suspected but not established, the vitreous (and aqueous, if involved) should be sampled. Vitreous samples are obtained either by needle aspiration or vitrectomy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F59512\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59512 \">figure 2</a>). Vitrectomy has a higher yield than needle aspiration of the vitreous [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fungal-endophthalmitis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Aqueous samples are obtained by needle aspiration or are obtained intraoperatively in cases of keratomycosis requiring corneal transplantation. In keratomycosis cases, samples of the removed cornea should be sent for fungal stain and culture. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-endophthalmitis-due-to-molds#H365246849\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of endophthalmitis due to molds&quot;, section on 'Vitrectomy and removal of foreign bodies'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27883799\"><span class=\"h2\">Microbiology studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intraocular samples should be sent for fungal stain and culture as well as Gram stain and bacterial culture since it is sometimes not possible to differentiate fungal from bacterial infections based on clinical appearance alone. Fungal cultures should be specifically requested, since molds typically grow best on Sabouraud dextrose agar and at a lower incubation temperature (25&deg;C) than used for bacterial cultures. Stains of intraocular fluids should also be requested. Gram stain identifies yeast but frequently cannot visualize the hyphae of molds. A fungal stain, such as calcofluor white, shows fluorescence of the cell wall of yeasts and molds and should always be requested.</p><p>If a vitrectomy has been performed, the vitreous washings should be filtered through a Millipore filter and the filter paper sterilely divided and incubated on various media. The ophthalmologist will also usually obtain a vitreous &quot;biopsy&quot; of undiluted vitreous at the start of the operation, and this material should be stained and cultured as well. Vitrectomy is discussed in greater detail separately.

However, negative blood cultures do not exclude endogenous fungal endophthalmitis because the eye may have been seeded much earlier during transient fungemia. This is the typical situation in asymptomatic patients who present with <em>Candida</em> endophthalmitis days to weeks after removal of an indwelling central catheter.

In most cases of endogenous endophthalmitis, the highly vascular choroid is seeded first.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Exogenous fungal endophthalmitis means that the infection was introduced from the &quot;outside,&quot; either by eye surgery, eye trauma, or extension of fungal infection of the cornea (termed &quot;fungal keratitis&quot; or &quot;keratomycosis&quot;). In cases following surgery involving the anterior segment (eg, cataract surgery) or following keratomycosis, the aqueous is typically infected first. (See <a href=\"#H27883231\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In temperate climates, endophthalmitis is most commonly caused by <em>Candida</em> spp and is typically endogenous in origin (ie, in the setting of candidemia). In contrast, in tropical climates, mold endophthalmitis is more common than <em>Candida</em> endophthalmitis. Mold endophthalmitis is usually exogenous in origin.

Initially, endogenous fungal endophthalmitis may be associated with minimal eye pain, and vision decrease may be subtle until the infection is advanced. In patients with risk factors for transient fungemia (eg, intravenous drug use, recent indwelling central venous catheter), endogenous fungal endophthalmitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting with posterior uveitis or panuveitis. (See <a href=\"#H535100592\" class=\"local\">'Endogenous fungal endophthalmitis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend that <strong>all</strong> patients with candidemia undergo an ophthalmic examination by an ophthalmologist within the first week of antifungal therapy following diagnosis. In neutropenic patients, we favor repeating the ophthalmologic examination following recovery from neutropenia. Early findings of endogenous <em>Candida</em> endophthalmitis include fluffy white lesions in the choroid and retina (chorioretinitis), often with overlying vitreous inflammation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F58685\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58685 \">picture 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F73575\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73575 \">picture 2</a>). Marked vitritis characterizes advanced <em>Candida</em> endophthalmitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F52795\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52795 \">picture 3</a>) and the vitreous inflammation often has a clumped appearance, described as &quot;fluff balls&quot; or &quot;string of pearls&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F73318\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73318 \">picture 4</a>). Endogenous mold endophthalmitis often has a similar appearance, with discrete white infiltrates in the choroid and retina and dense infiltrates (&quot;fluff balls&quot;) in the vitreous.
