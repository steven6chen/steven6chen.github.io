For example, if a man touches a woman's breasts without her permission, that is sexual assault. In fact, physical contact does not even have to take place for something to be considered assault. For instance, assault could include being forced to watch a sex act.</p><p>People sometimes refer to sexual assault as &quot;rape.&quot; But what most people think of as rape is just one form of assault.</p><p>Sexual assault can happen when someone is threatened or forced into doing something. It can also happen when the victim is passed out, drunk, or on drugs and not able to make decisions for him or herself. People can be sexually assaulted by strangers or people they know, such as family members.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1830501369\"><span class=\"h1\">How common is sexual assault?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sexual assault is very common. In the United States, 1 in 3 women will be sexually assaulted sometime in her life. But women are not the only victims. Up to 10 percent of rape victims are men.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1830501376\"><span class=\"h1\">What should I do if I am sexually assaulted?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first thing you should do is find a safe place away from the person who attacked you. Then:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Call a close friend or family member.</strong> Choose someone who will give you support no matter what.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Call your doctor or nurse or go to the emergency room.</strong> Your doctor or nurse can offer advice on what to do and the best place to get help. In the emergency room, a doctor or nurse can do an exam and try to make sure you are OK. He or she might also offer you medicines that can reduce your chances of getting pregnant (if you are a woman) or getting an infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If you say it's OK, the doctor or nurse can take samples of cells or fluid from your body and clothes. These samples can show who your attacker was and what he or she did. You do not have to let the doctor or nurse do anything you do not want.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>You can always go to the emergency room in your local hospital. But if you need help finding a place in the US that offers medical care after rape, you can call the sexual assault hotline, 800-656-4673.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Do NOT try to clean up before you see a doctor or nurse. </strong>If you clean up, you might wash away proof of what happened.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Do not change clothes</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Do not take a shower or bath</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Do not brush your teeth</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Do not wash the inside of your vagina or rectum (in other words, do not douche)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If you can wait, try not to go to the bathroom or to eat anything until after you have seen a doctor or nurse</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Find a counselor &ndash; someone you can talk to about what happened.</strong> Good options include a crisis counselor, a social worker, a sexual assault nurse examiner, or your own doctor or nurse. Your doctor or nurse can also help you find a crisis counselor or social worker.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Talk to your counselor about filing a police report.</strong> He or she can help you understand the risks and benefits of filing a report.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>See your doctor or nurse again 1 to 2 weeks later. </strong>This gives them a chance to make sure everything is OK.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ask about &quot;victim compensation services.&quot;</strong> Some states have programs that give money to victims of sexual assault.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Protect others if you might have an infection.</strong> For at least 3 months after being raped, if you have sex with someone, use a condom every time. This will reduce the chance that you will spread any infections you might have caught. If you are a woman, wait at least 3 months before trying to get pregnant. That way, you can find out before you get pregnant if you have an infection that could hurt a baby.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1830501383\"><span class=\"h1\">What if it has been a while since I was attacked?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>See a doctor or nurse anyway. It doesn't matter if the doctor or nurse can't collect proof of the attack. The doctor or nurse can help you understand your risk of infection or pregnancy and help you recover from the event. Plus, he or she can offer advice on reporting the event, if you want to.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1830501390\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I do not want to report my assault?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At first, many people do not want to report their assault. You don't have to if you don't want to. But people often change their mind later.</p><p>If you do not want to report the event, it can be useful to speak with a doctor or nurse anyway. In most states, doctors and nurses can collect evidence without giving it to the police. Evidence is most useful when it is collected right after the assault.</p><p>If you see a doctor or nurse, he or she can take samples and write down your description of what happened. That way, if you decide you want to report the event later, you already have the evidence collected. Of course, you can report an event later even if you do not see a doctor or nurse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1830501397\"><span class=\"h1\">What can I do if I am worried about pregnancy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you do not want to get pregnant, you can take a medicine to prevent pregnancy &ndash; even after being raped. The medicine that can keep you from getting pregnant is called &quot;emergency contraception.&quot; It can work up to 5 days after you are raped. But it works better the sooner you take it, so don't wait. If you are older than 17, you can get some forms of emergency contraception without a prescription. If you would like to get emergency contraception, and prefer not to see a doctor, ask about it at your local pharmacy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1830501404\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-contraception-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Emergency contraception (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=care-after-sexual-assault-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Care after sexual assault (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-contraception-morning-after-pill-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Emergency contraception (morning after pill) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
