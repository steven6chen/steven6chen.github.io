Primary PCI is preferred for most patients if it can be performed by an experienced operator with less than a 90 minute delay from presentation to the emergency department. However, fibrinolysis remains an important therapeutic modality, due in part to limited availability of primary PCI. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-selecting-a-reperfusion-strategy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute ST elevation myocardial infarction: Selecting a reperfusion strategy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-percutaneous-coronary-intervention-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-determinants-of-outcome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary percutaneous coronary intervention in acute ST elevation myocardial infarction: Determinants of outcome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fibrinolysis-for-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction-initiation-of-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fibrinolysis for acute ST elevation myocardial infarction: Initiation of therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The principle reason for the preference of PCI to fibrinolysis is the relatively high frequency of failure of fibrinolysis to establish reperfusion (primary failure). In addition, early reocclusion occurs in a significant number of cases. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Primary failure'</a> below and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Threatened reocclusion'</a> below.)</p><p>Primary failure of fibrinolysis is often manifested clinically by persistent or worsening chest pain (particularly if associated with other symptoms such as dyspnea and diaphoresis), persistent or worsening ST segment elevation, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hemodynamic instability or heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-failed-fibrinolysis-thrombolysis-or-threatened-reocclusion-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, these clinical factors are not sufficiently predictive in all patients. As a result, in the absence of clear indications of reperfusion, the clinician must maintain a high index of suspicion for primary failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-failed-fibrinolysis-thrombolysis-or-threatened-reocclusion-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Additionally, in patients who undergo diagnostic angiography after fibrinolysis, both TIMI <span class=\"nowrap\">0/1</span> and TIMI 2 flow are associated with increased mortality compared to those with TIMI 3 (normal) flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-failed-fibrinolysis-thrombolysis-or-threatened-reocclusion-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis of primary failure'</a> below.)</p><p>These observations have provided the rationale for immediate angiography with intent to perform rescue PCI, as well as routine early elective angiography one to two days after fibrinolysis. However, angiography in the first two hours after fibrinolytic therapy, when bleeding risks are higher, is reserved for patients with overt evidence of failed fibrinolysis. The use of routine angiography after fibrinolysis is discussed separately.

This topic will review the roles of angiography followed by PCI (or coronary artery bypass graft surgery if indicated) for failed fibrinolysis or threatened reocclusion and of retreatment with fibrinolytic drugs for threatened reocclusion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL ISSUES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Importance of restoration of normal flow</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The outcome after fibrinolytic therapy in patients with an ST elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) is related to the degree to which flow has been restored in the infarct-related artery.

In clinical trials of fibrinolysis, patency is usually measured at 60 to 90 minutes after the administration of fibrinolytic therapy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TIMI 0 refers to the absence of any antegrade flow beyond a coronary occlusion.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TIMI 1 flow is faint antegrade coronary flow beyond the occlusion, although filling of the distal coronary bed is incomplete.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TIMI 2 flow is delayed or sluggish antegrade flow with complete filling of the distal territory.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TIMI 3 flow is normal flow which fills the distal coronary bed completely.</p><p/><p>Only TIMI 3 (normal) flow is associated with a mortality benefit after fibrinolysis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F75629\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75629 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F70952\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70952 \">figure 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-failed-fibrinolysis-thrombolysis-or-threatened-reocclusion-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/3-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-8</a>]. The magnitude of this effect was illustrated in a meta-analysis of five trials of almost 4000 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-failed-fibrinolysis-thrombolysis-or-threatened-reocclusion-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Since mortality is also increased in patients with TIMI 2 flow, some have also considered TIMI 2 a sign of failed fibrinolysis and some trials of rescue therapies have enrolled such patients.

In addition, ST segment elevation resolution and patency of the infarct-related artery are not always correlated.

TIMI 3 flow was present in only 79 percent of patients with complete (&ge;70 percent) ST segment resolution and was also present in 44 to 50 percent of patients with partial or no ST segment resolution. The latter patients were at increased risk for mortality, as the lack of complete ST segment resolution was presumably due to extensive microvascular dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-failed-fibrinolysis-thrombolysis-or-threatened-reocclusion-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis of threatened reocclusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Threatened reocclusion is characterized by the development of early recurrent ischemia after apparently successful fibrinolysis.

Repeat fibrinolysis (performed in 28 percent in United States centers and 47 percent in centers in other countries) and revascularization with PCI or surgery (performed in 35 percent in United States centers and 15 percent in centers in other countries) were equally effective and were associated with a significantly lower 30-day mortality than conservative therapy (11 and 11 versus 28 percent) without any increase in the rate of stroke.</p><p>Thus, repeat <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alteplase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alteplase</a> infusions are feasible, can stabilize a substantial number of patients with threatened early infarction, and, even when relief of ischemia is temporary, can reduce myocardial damage in those proceeding to mechanical or surgical revascularization.

In an analysis of 20,092 patients from the TIMI and InTIME-II trials, CABG was performed in 1048 (5.2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-failed-fibrinolysis-thrombolysis-or-threatened-reocclusion-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Percutaneous coronary intervention is preferred in this setting because of increased risks of perioperative mortality and major hemorrhage with CABG, especially if the interval between administration of the fibrinolytic agent and surgery is short. In an analysis from the TIMI II study, 390 patients underwent CABG after fibrinolytic treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-failed-fibrinolysis-thrombolysis-or-threatened-reocclusion-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Patients undergoing surgery within 24 hours of study, compared to those undergoing later surgery, had higher rates of perioperative mortality (17 versus 4 percent) and major hemorrhage (74 versus 51 percent).</p><p>The risk of bleeding for patients undergoing CABG after fibrinolysis may vary with the specific fibrinolytic agent. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tenecteplase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Tenecteplase</a> is associated with significantly less fibrinogen depletion than either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alteplase-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alteplase</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reteplase-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">reteplase</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-failed-fibrinolysis-thrombolysis-or-threatened-reocclusion-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. As a result, patients treated with tenecteplase may be able to undergo CABG within 24 hours of fibrinolysis more safely than patients treated with the other agents, although this has not been specifically demonstrated in clinical studies.</p><p>While early morbidity and mortality are of concern in this setting, long-term outcome is much better and suggests that surgery may be appropriate for carefully selected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-failed-fibrinolysis-thrombolysis-or-threatened-reocclusion-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/24,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,52</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h1\">RECOMMENDATIONS OF OTHERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recommendations from the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) and the American College of Cardiology <span class=\"nowrap\">Foundation/American</span> Heart Association <span class=\"nowrap\">(ACCF/AHA)</span> on the management of failed fibrinolysis or threatened reocclusion have been published in their respective ST elevation myocardial infarction 2012 and 2013 guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-failed-fibrinolysis-thrombolysis-or-threatened-reocclusion-in-acute-st-elevation-myocardial-infarction/abstract/12,13,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13,54</a>]. Both guidelines make strong recommendations to perform coronary angiography with the intent to perform percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) in patients treated with fibrinolysis who have cardiogenic shock or acute severe heart failure (after presentation), intermediate- or high-risk findings on predischarge noninvasive ischemia testing, or those with ischemia that is spontaneous or provoked by minimal exertion. PCI for evidence of failed reperfusion or reocclusion was graded as a strong recommendation by the ESC and as a weak recommendation by the <span class=\"nowrap\">ACCF/AHA</span>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3312658145\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Immediate percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the treatment of choice for both forms. It is called rescue or salvage PCI when performed after primary failure. For this reason, patients should be referred to a facility with PCI capability soon after fibrinolysis in most cases so that failed fibrinolysis or threatened reocclusion can be managed expeditiously. This strategy will avoid the need to consider repeat fibrinolysis except in rare cases.</p><p>Primary failure of fibrinolysis occurs when there is evidence of continuing or worsening myocardial ischemia and the threatened reocclusion when there is evidence of early recurrent ischemia after apparently successful fibrinolysis. The former is often manifested clinically by persistent or worsening chest pain (particularly if associated with other symptoms such as dyspnea and diaphoresis), persistent or worsening ST segment elevation, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hemodynamic instability or heart failure. However, these clinical factors are not sufficiently predictive in all patients. As a result, in the absence of clear indications of reperfusion, the clinician must maintain a high index of suspicion for primary failure. Threatened reocclusion is characterized by the development of early recurrent ischemia after apparently successful fibrinolysis.</p><p>For patients with evidence of primary failure of fibrinolysis, we recommend rescue PCI as opposed to either repeat fibrinolysis or conservative care (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). If rescue PCI cannot be performed within 12 hours, we suggest conservative care as opposed to repeat fibrinolysis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Rescue PCI'</a> above.)</p><p>For patients with evidence of threatened reocclusion after fibrinolysis, we suggest PCI as opposed to either repeat fibrinolysis or conservative care (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). If PCI cannot be performed within two hours, we suggest repeat fibrinolysis with a nonantigenic agent as opposed to conservative care (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>).
