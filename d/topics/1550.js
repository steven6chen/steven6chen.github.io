They are usually preceded or associated with nonspecific systemic symptoms, including low-grade fever, malaise, or upper respiratory or gastrointestinal tract infection. </p><p>Atypical exanthems are a common cause of pediatric urgent care visits. The most frequent cause is a viral infection, followed by drug reactions, and bacterial infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-exanthems-in-children/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. </p><p>This section will review three uncommon diseases that present with an atypical rash: unilateral laterothoracic exanthem; coxsackievirus A6 hand, foot, and mouth syndrome; and papular-purpuric gloves and socks syndrome.

It typically affects children between one and five years of age, but has been also reported in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-exanthems-in-children/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>]. </p><p>ULE occurs year round, with a peak during spring. The cause is unknown. Indirect evidence, such as patients' age, occurrence of small epidemics, seasonal distribution, association with upper respiratory tract infections, and spontaneous resolution, suggests a viral etiology. However, microbiologic studies on throat, stool, blood, and skin samples from affected children have not identified a specific etiologic agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-exanthems-in-children/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11086039\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The skin eruption typically begins on one side of the trunk and extends toward the axilla; less often, it starts in the inguinal crease or on an extremity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F94551\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef94551 \">picture 1</a>).

The eruption spreads centrifugally and may become bilateral, although unilateral predominance is maintained. </p><p>Early lesions may have a morbilliform appearance, sometimes with a surrounding pale halo. Over time, lesions tend to become more scaly or eczematous and occasionally develop a central dusky or gray color.

Coxsackievirus A6 HFMD has been reported also in young adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-exanthems-in-children/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In 2015, an outbreak of 53 cases of HFMD caused by coxsackievirus A6 was reported among basic military trainees in Texas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-exanthems-in-children/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p>HFMD is transmitted person-to-person via oral or respiratory route following contact with vesicle fluid, respiratory secretions, and feces, and initial viral replication takes place in the pharynx and intestine. Subsequent amplification within lymphoid tissue produces a viremia with distant multiorgan spread, including the skin. Hand washing and routine disinfection of surfaces help preventing spreading.</p><p>There is a single case report of atypical HFMD caused by Coxsackie B5 virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-exanthems-in-children/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11086101\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with coxsackievirus A6 HFMD present with fever and systemic symptoms as in typical HFMD, but usually have a more severe cutaneous involvement.

In young adults, the disease may present with erythematous papulovesicular lesions on the face, oral mucosa, extensor surfaces of the upper and lower extremities, and palms and soles; confluent, hemorrhagic and crusted lesions can also be seen on the extremities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F108969\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef108969 \">picture 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/atypical-exanthems-in-children/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p>The course of the acute illness and the benign outcome are similar in classic and atypical HFMD. Systemic symptoms usually subside in a few days; the skin lesions resolve without scarring in days to weeks.</p><p>Onychomadesis (separation of the proximal nail plate from the nail matrix and nail bed) due to arrest of nail matrix growth is frequent and most often occurs three to eight weeks after the disease onset.
