Guidelines suggest that when tolerance to enteral nutrition is evident, parenteral nutrition should be weaned and discontinued when &gt;60 percent of the patients' needs are met enterally, although there are no data to support this practice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-parenteral-nutrition/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Our practice is to wean parenteral nutrition proportionate to the amount of enteral nutrition being delivered.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Access</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Parenteral nutrition given for more than a few days must be delivered via a central venous catheter because its high osmotic load is not tolerated by peripheral veins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-parenteral-nutrition/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Parenteral nutrition may be given via a peripheral vein if it is significantly more diluted, so called peripheral parenteral nutrition (PPN). Because of the ease of obtaining central access in the hospital, the large volume usually required to administer PPN, and the lack of benefit from short-term parenteral nutrition, PPN is rarely indicated. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Peripheral parenteral nutrition'</a> below.)</p><p>Shorter-term (ie, on the order of one to two weeks), parenteral nutrition is generally delivered through a peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC), or a subclavian, internal jugular, or femoral central venous catheter. The femoral site is least desirable because there may be an increased risk of catheter-related infections associated with this site compared to the alternative sites and should be avoided if possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-parenteral-nutrition/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Bloodstream infection'</a> below.)</p><p>Long-term parenteral nutrition does not require a tunneled central venous catheter (eg, Hickman catheter, Groshong catheter, or implanted infusion port) as peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) lines have proven similarly safe. A tunneled catheter may be preferable if patients have recurrent infections while receiving parenteral nutrition at home through a PICC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-parenteral-nutrition/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Bloodstream infection'</a> below.)</p><p>Single lumen central venous catheters should be dedicated solely for the infusion of parenteral nutrition, while multiple lumen central venous catheters should have one port dedicated solely for the infusion of parenteral nutrition. In addition, catheter manipulations should be minimized. These interventions may decrease the infectious complications associated with parenteral nutrition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-parenteral-nutrition/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. For patients who have an existing line, a new line is not typically required unless there has been septicemia during the life of the existing line.</p><p>Indications, insertion, and complications of central venous catheters are discussed separately.

These recommend that parenteral nutrition be prescribed by a multidisciplinary team of physicians, nutritionists, pharmacists, and nurses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-parenteral-nutrition/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Parenteral nutrition should not be prescribed by clinicians nor compounded by pharmacists without specific training because it is complicated and requires advanced knowledge about issues such as nutrient metabolism and solute compatibility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-parenteral-nutrition/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. </p><p>Parenteral nutrition is an admixture of solutions containing dextrose, amino acids, electrolytes, vitamins, minerals, and trace elements. Lipid emulsion may be infused separately or added to the mixture, but mixing all three, a so-called total nutrient admixture, or 3-in-1 parenteral nutrition, is favored by most experts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-parenteral-nutrition/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The exact composition and infusion rate are tailored to the nutritional and fluid needs of each patient. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-an-overview#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutrition support in critically ill patients: An overview&quot;, section on 'Nutritional requirements'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Dextrose</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dextrose-containing stock solutions are available in a variety of concentrations, most commonly 40, 50, and 70 percent. The percentage of calories that is contributed by dextrose is titrated according to individual factors, such as severity of illness, the caloric needs of the patient, and the patient's ability to tolerate fluid volume.</p><p>The caloric contribution of dextrose in medical solutions is 3.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/gm,</span> which differs from dietary carbohydrate (4 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/gm)</span>. The reason for the difference is that water contributes to the weight of the dextrose-hydrate that is used to prepare parenteral nutrition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Amino acids and electrolytes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Amino acid solutions contain most essential and nonessential amino acids. The exceptions are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arginine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">arginine</a> and glutamine. While these are thought to be conditionally essential in critical illness, due to blockade of their metabolic pathways in catabolism, research does not support their supplementation. The caloric contribution of amino acids is approximately 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/gm</span>. The buffer used in amino acid solution contains electrolytes, usually in small quantities. Amino acid solutions with large amounts of electrolytes have been used infrequently because they limit the degree to which parenteral nutrition can be customized. However, with the increasing use of premixed parenteral nutrition with a variety of available electrolyte content, customization may not be as necessary. It is occasionally necessary to use amino acid solutions with further electrolyte restriction (usually these are 15 percent amino acid solutions), particularly in patients with renal failure when electrolytes and phosphate levels are difficult to control.</p><p>The amino acid stock solutions come in concentrations ranging from 5.5 to 15 percent. Higher concentrations are useful for minimizing volume and electrolytes delivered to patients. Enteral protein, peptide, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arginine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">arginine</a> supplementation is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-enteral-nutrition#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutrition support in critically ill patients: Enteral nutrition&quot;, section on 'Composition'</a>.)</p><p>Enrichment of parenteral nutrition with branched chain amino acids has been studied, but there is insufficient evidence to recommend this approach. A meta-analysis of four randomized trials (202 patients) that compared branched chain amino acid-enriched parenteral nutrition to standard parenteral nutrition found a trend toward decreased mortality among patients who received branched chain amino acids (24 versus 36 percent, relative risk 0.58, 95% CI 0.26-1.28) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-parenteral-nutrition/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, the meta-analysis was limited by methodological differences among the trials and an imprecise estimate of the magnitude of effect. Other meta-analyses have found no difference in infection rate, ICU length of stay, or hospital length of stay.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Lipids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lipids are provided as an emulsion that may be infused separately or added to the mixture (total nutrient admixture [TNA] or three-in-one). In the United States, most lipid emulsion consists of long-chain omega-6 triglycerides derived from soybean and safflower oils and then emulsified using egg phospholipids and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycerin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glycerin</a>. Recently, mixtures of several types of lipids (eg, refined olive, soybean, and fish oil emulsions), have been approved and are available for use in the US. However, they have not conclusively demonstrated any clinical meaningful benefits among patients receiving parenteral nutrition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-parenteral-nutrition/abstract/14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-17</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intestinal-failure-associated-liver-disease-in-infants#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intestinal failure-associated liver disease in infants&quot;, section on 'Fish oil-based lipid emulsions'</a>). The caloric contribution of a typical lipid emulsion is 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/g</span> or 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/mL</span> in 20 percent emulsion and 11 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/g</span> or 1.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/mL</span> in 10 percent emulsion. Dietary fat provides 9 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/g,</span> but there is a contribution of calories from the emulsifiers used to create the lipid suspension for intravenous administration. Use of intravenous fat emulsions should be done with care in patients with prior allergy to eggs as allergic cross-reactions have been reported. But these are very rare. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Vitamins and trace elements</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients receiving parenteral nutrition must receive adequate vitamins and minerals to prevent deficiencies. For most patients, a unit dose of a standard multivitamin and multi-trace element solution will suffice to provide minimum daily requirements. It is advisable that patients with cholestasis not receive copper or manganese, as these are excreted in bile. A total bilirubin of 2 is often used as a cut off to restrict these, and it is often necessary to order the remaining trace elements individually and then follow levels. There are also concerns about clearance of some vitamins in anephric patients. It is not our practice to restrict either vitamins or minerals in these patients, and to monitor levels if patients are on parenteral nutrition for extended periods.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1818381960\"><span class=\"h2\">Therapeutic vitamin and mineral supplementation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is not our practice to supplement vitamins and minerals above the recommended daily amounts, unless a deficiency is documented. It should be noted that a deficiency is not the same as a low level. Rather, a deficiency occurs only when a lack of a substance causes an undesired health outcome that is reversed or prevented by supplementation. For example, vitamin D, which is protein bound, drops in critical illness. But even though there is a correlation between vitamin D levels and ICU mortality, supplementation of vitamin D has no effect. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-parenteral-nutrition/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. The decrease in vitamin D levels is due to the decrease in carrier protein levels, much in the same way albumin decreases. Despite the incorrect use of the term in a vast literature, low vitamin D levels in this context does not constitute a deficiency.</p><p>Numerous clinical trials have examined the effect of antioxidants on critically ill patients when given as single nutrients (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selenium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">selenium</a>) or as a combination of nutrients (selenium, copper, zinc, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-a-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin A</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-c-ascorbic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin C</a>, vitamin E, and N-acetylcysteine). The trials administered the antioxidants in various ways, including as a separate intravenous infusion, as a component of parenteral nutrition, as a component of enteral nutrition, and orally.</p><p>A meta-analysis of 15 randomized trials (1647 patients) found that critically ill patients who received vitamins and trace elements, either alone or in combination, had a lower mortality rate than patients who did not receive vitamins or trace elements (20 versus 27 percent, relative risk 0.76, 95% CI 0.65-0.88) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-parenteral-nutrition/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Similar meta-analyses showed improvement in the duration of mechanical ventilation, but no differences in infectious complications, hospital length of stay, or ICU length of stay.</p><p>Few of the trials looked specifically at patients receiving parenteral nutrition. Rather, most enrolled a heterogeneous sample of patients receiving either parenteral or enteral nutrition and did not look for differences in the effects of the vitamins and trace elements in these subgroups. Given their safety, it seems reasonable to provide vitamins and trace elements to most critically ill patients, regardless of the type of nutrition support that they are receiving. The optimal mixture of vitamins and trace elements is yet to be determined. Enteral vitamin and trace element supplementation is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-enteral-nutrition#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutrition support in critically ill patients: Enteral nutrition&quot;, section on 'Vitamins and trace elements'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Glutamine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glutamine is a precursor for nucleotide synthesis and an important fuel source for rapidly dividing cells, such as gastrointestinal epithelia. Despite evidence that indicates that parenteral glutamine may be beneficial to patients who are receiving parenteral nutrition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-parenteral-nutrition/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>], glutamine is only available in the United States as a non-sterile powder and is not generally recommended for patients who are receiving parenteral nutrition. Enteral glutamine supplementation is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-enteral-nutrition#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutrition support in critically ill patients: Enteral nutrition&quot;, section on 'Glutamine'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">MONITORING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Routine monitoring of parenteral nutrition includes measurement of fluid intake and output, as well as selected laboratory studies. It is reasonable to measure serum electrolytes, glucose, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate daily, or more, until they are stable. It is similarly reasonable to measure aminotransferases, bilirubin, and triglyceride at least once each week during treatment. More frequent measurements should be performed after parenteral nutrition is initiated, or after changes in the composition. Frequency of monitoring should be adjusted to the individual patient&rsquo;s acuity, stability, and risks for deficiencies. General guidelines have been published [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-parenteral-nutrition/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who receive parenteral nutrition support are at risk for infection, adverse metabolic effects, and complications related to venous access. Clinical practice guidelines, protocols, and oversight by multidisciplinary teams have been shown to reduce the complications and total cost of parenteral nutrition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-parenteral-nutrition/abstract/7,20,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,20,24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Bloodstream infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients receiving parenteral nutrition are at increased risk of acquiring a bloodstream infection (bacterial and fungal), compared to patients who have central venous catheters but are not receiving parenteral nutrition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-parenteral-nutrition/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. This risk is likely to have decreased since new government reimbursement policies were initiated which preclude payment for prolonged hospital stay due to catheter-related sepsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-parenteral-nutrition/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Among patients receiving parenteral nutrition, factors that are independently associated with bloodstream infection include poor patient hygiene, insertion of the central venous catheter under emergent circumstances, and, to a lesser extent, the severity of illness and duration of central venous catheterization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-parenteral-nutrition/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Conversely, proper hand hygiene and maximal barrier precautions during insertion of the central venous catheter are associated with fewer bloodstream infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-parenteral-nutrition/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Diagnosis and treatment of catheter-related bloodstream infection is discussed separately.

Routine monitoring of serum glucose, electrolytes, and volume status may minimize the impact of such complications.</p><p>Hyperglycemia is particularly common among patients who receive parenteral nutrition. In a meta-analysis of six randomized trials (264 critically ill patients with acute pancreatitis), the incidence of hyperglycemia was approximately two times greater for patients who received parenteral nutrition than patients who received enteral nutrition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nutrition-support-in-critically-ill-patients-parenteral-nutrition/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Both groups had similar nutrient intake. The relationship between hyperglycemia and clinical outcomes in critically ill patients is discussed in detail elsewhere.

Patients with ongoing electrolyte losses (eg, from diarrhea, vomiting, fistulas) are at increased risk of refeeding syndrome. It is defined primarily by manifestations of severe hypophosphatemia (including respiratory failure, cardiovascular collapse, rhabdomyolysis, seizures, and delirium), but hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia, and Wernicke&rsquo;s encephalopathy also occur. Refeeding syndrome is described in greater detail elsewhere.

To deliver adequate nutrients, either a large volume or a high fat formulation must be used. Frequent replacement of intravenous access is usually necessary. Despite an osmolarity lower than conventional parenteral nutrition, PPN is still quite hyperosmolar and irritating to the peripheral veins. PPN is rarely prescribed because of the uncertain clinical benefit of short-term parenteral nutrition.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H542172039\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
