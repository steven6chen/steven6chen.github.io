Specific phobias related to clinical procedures include blood-injection-injury phobia, dental phobia, and MRI claustrophobia.</p><p>This topic addresses the epidemiology and clinical manifestations of acute procedure anxiety in adults, related to common medical and surgical procedures.

The fears experienced are often rational (eg, concern that a breast biopsy may find a malignancy), but in some cases can be irrational (eg, fear of suffocation during an MRI).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2928505\"><span class=\"h3\">Specific phobias</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Presentations of acute procedure anxiety are diagnosed as a specific phobia under DSM-5 criteria only when the focus of patients&rsquo; fear is specific to the procedure or its immediate effects (eg, a fear of seeing blood during venipuncture or suffocating during an MRI scan). A specific phobia would not be diagnosed when the patient&rsquo;s <span class=\"nowrap\">fear/anxiety</span> is about, for example, the implications or outcomes of the procedure (eg, the fear that a diagnostic procedure may detect an illness with a poor prognosis). Specific phobias related to clinical procedures include</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H86700484\"><span class=\"h4\">Blood-injection-injury phobia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blood-injection-injury phobia is characterized by the fear of seeing blood, receiving an injection, or of other invasive medical procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-procedure-anxiety-in-adults-epidemiology-and-clinical-presentation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The phobic reaction to seeing blood may be accompanied by a vasovagal response. Individuals with blood-injection-injury phobia often avoid diagnostic and medical procedures, leading to a delay in the diagnosis and treatment of an illness, which may negatively impact health.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12823194\"><span class=\"h4\">Dental phobia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dental phobia is the specific fear of going to the dentist and the fear may be triggered by multiple stimuli in the dental office, such as sound of the drill, receiving an intraoral injection or undergoing any dental treatment. Individuals with dental phobia may suffer significant distress, avoid going to the dentist, or require sedation to have necessary work completed. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12823201\"><span class=\"h4\">MRI claustrophobia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Claustrophobia is the specific fear of enclosed spaces and is categorized under the situational subtype of specific phobia in DSM-5, because patients in MRI scanners are required to be in a very tight space without moving, and remain in an uncomfortable position for an extended period of time. There is significant noise interference and the room temperature in an MRI suite is often cold.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12823208\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given the large number of diagnostic, medical, and surgical procedures in contemporary health care, there is surprisingly scant literature on rates of procedure-related anxiety. Rates of the prevalence of clinically significant anxiety in community based samples are limited to studies of blood-injection-injury phobia and dental phobia. Studies reporting prevalence rates of acute procedure anxiety in patients undergoing specific medical or surgical procedures are described below. Studies reporting mean anxiety levels among such patients are reported more briefly.</p><p>Many of these studies have methodologic limitations. In studies of acute procedure anxiety unrelated to a diagnosis of specific phobia, data on anxiety levels have been limited to patient completion of self-assessment questionnaires. The instruments used vary widely, from one-item visual analog scales to instruments with established reliability and validity. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2928841\"><span class=\"h2\">Specific phobias</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Community-based studies have estimated that 2 to 5 percent of the general population in the United States has experienced blood-injection-injury phobia, dental phobia, or MRI claustrophobia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2928848\"><span class=\"h3\">Blood-injection-injury phobia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Community surveys estimated that 3.1 to 4.5 percent of the general population in the United States suffers from blood-injection-injury phobia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-procedure-anxiety-in-adults-epidemiology-and-clinical-presentation/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. All of these surveys included dental phobia within the blood-injection-injury phobia subtype. Within this subtype, one study found that 23 percent had a fear of blood, 47 percent a fear of injections, and 78 percent a fear of dentists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-procedure-anxiety-in-adults-epidemiology-and-clinical-presentation/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>There are limited data on the rates of blood-injection-injury phobia in the medical setting:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study of 3315 adults undergoing venipuncture in a United States outpatient hospital-based phlebotomy clinic reported that 7.5 percent of the participants reported significant anxiety symptoms during the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-procedure-anxiety-in-adults-epidemiology-and-clinical-presentation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Patients experiencing anxiety were more likely to report a history of vasovagal reactions and vasovagal syncope compared to patients who did not, and were also more likely to report significant fears of fainting, disgust, pain, and health concerns during injections. The study had multiple limitations, including the absence of a standardized instrument to assess anxiety. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 1275 patients with insulin-dependent Type I or II diabetes in the Netherlands, 9.3 percent endorsed extreme fear of injecting themselves with insulin and testing their glucose levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-procedure-anxiety-in-adults-epidemiology-and-clinical-presentation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 115 insulin-treated diabetic patients in the United Kingdom, 14 percent reported that they had avoided insulin injections secondary to anxiety.

The prevalence of anxiety over dental procedures has been estimated at 10 percent, based on studies that have used self-report screening questionnaires [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-procedure-anxiety-in-adults-epidemiology-and-clinical-presentation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Rates of dental anxiety in the United States have been found to vary across population subgroups, with rates of 14 percent in adults over 65 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-procedure-anxiety-in-adults-epidemiology-and-clinical-presentation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], 19 percent in university students [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-procedure-anxiety-in-adults-epidemiology-and-clinical-presentation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], and as high as 37.8 percent among HIV-positive patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-procedure-anxiety-in-adults-epidemiology-and-clinical-presentation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Similar rates have been found internationally; as an example, in a university dental practice in Turkey, 13.4 percent of dental patients reported high levels of dental anxiety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-procedure-anxiety-in-adults-epidemiology-and-clinical-presentation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>A higher prevalence of dental anxiety, compared to dental phobia, is expected as a phobia diagnosis requires additional functional impairment or distress criteria. In a study of 18-year-olds in New Zealand, only eight of 100 individuals who screened positive for dental anxiety met DSM-III-R criteria for dental phobia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-procedure-anxiety-in-adults-epidemiology-and-clinical-presentation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Dental anxiety tends to occur more commonly in females [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-procedure-anxiety-in-adults-epidemiology-and-clinical-presentation/abstract/10,11,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11,13,14</a>] and those with less education [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-procedure-anxiety-in-adults-epidemiology-and-clinical-presentation/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Dental anxiety is also more common in patients in the lower income bracket, those without dental insurance, and those without a usual place for dental care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-procedure-anxiety-in-adults-epidemiology-and-clinical-presentation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Studies have reported mixed results regarding the influence of age and race [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-procedure-anxiety-in-adults-epidemiology-and-clinical-presentation/abstract/10,11,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11,16</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2928862\"><span class=\"h3\">MRI claustrophobia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based on naturalistic studies from 1984 to 2004 with a total of 17,961 patients, an estimated 2.3 percent of patients undergoing an MRI examination have claustrophobic reactions resulting in premature termination of scanning or medication to complete the scan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-procedure-anxiety-in-adults-epidemiology-and-clinical-presentation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Claustrophobic reactions are less likely to occur in newer scanners with a wider magnetic bore compared to convention MRI machines (0.7 versus 2.1 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-procedure-anxiety-in-adults-epidemiology-and-clinical-presentation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. MRI claustrophobia is more likely to occur in females, those in middle age (40 to 65 years of age), and during head-first examinations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-procedure-anxiety-in-adults-epidemiology-and-clinical-presentation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p>The rate of MRI claustrophobia in the general population may be higher than that estimated in the clinical sample above, as claustrophobia was stringently defined as requiring sedation or premature termination of scanning during an actual MRI examination. Patients who have claustrophobia would not have been included as a case of claustrophobia if they did not take medication but completed the MRI examination despite great distress. Other patients with claustrophobia may simply avoid MRI exams and would not be included in these studies. As an example, in a study of 1215 women with elevated risk of breast cancer who participated in a trial of supplemental MRI screening for the disease, 42.1 percent of participants declined further screening with breast MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-procedure-anxiety-in-adults-epidemiology-and-clinical-presentation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

A specific phobia would not be diagnosed when the patient&rsquo;s <span class=\"nowrap\">fear/anxiety</span> is not specific to the procedure itself, but about, for example, its outcome or implications (eg, a fear that a diagnostic procedure may detect a malignancy). (See <a href=\"#H2928505\" class=\"local\">'Specific phobias'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Examples of acute procedure anxiety that is diagnosed as a specific phobia include: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In patients with blood phobia, the fear at the sight of blood is typically concern about physical sensations, fear of fainting, and feelings of disgust.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Dental phobia is the specific fear of going to the dentist and the fear may be triggered by multiple stimuli in the dental office, such as sound of the drill, receiving an intraoral injection or undergoing any dental treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In patients with MRI claustrophobia, the main focus is fear of suffocation and fear of restriction while in an enclosed space, though alternatively, patients may fear being harmed by the machine or losing control.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The epidemiology of the specific phobias has been studied with more rigorous methods than other manifestations of acute procedure anxiety. Community-based studies have estimated that 2 to 5 percent of the general population in the United States has experienced blood-injection-injury phobia, dental phobia, or MRI claustrophobia. (See <a href=\"#H12823208\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The avoidance or delay of clinical procedures resulting from acute procedure anxiety has been associated with poor health outcomes in a variety of patient samples.
