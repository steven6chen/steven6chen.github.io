Among adults in resource-rich settings, diarrhea is often a &quot;nuisance disease&quot; in the healthy individual [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-acute-diarrhea-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>Most cases of acute diarrhea in adults are of infectious etiology, and most cases resolve with symptomatic treatment alone. When clinicians care for adults with diarrhea, two important decision points are when to perform stool testing and whether to initiate empiric antimicrobial therapy. Our approach to adults with acute diarrhea will be reviewed here and generally focuses on distinguishing those infectious etiologies for which treatment is beneficial from other causes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F68348\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef68348 \">algorithm 1</a>). </p><p>In the United States, expert guidelines on the diagnosis and management of acute diarrhea include guidelines from the Infectious Diseases Society of America [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-acute-diarrhea-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] and the American College of Gastroenterology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-acute-diarrhea-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Links to these and other guidelines can be found elsewhere.

It reflects increased water content of the stool, whether due to impaired water absorption <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> active water secretion by the bowel. </p><p>The following definitions have been suggested according to the duration of symptoms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute &ndash; 14 days or fewer in duration</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persistent diarrhea &ndash; more than 14 but fewer than 30 days in duration</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic &ndash; more than 30 days in duration</p><p/><p>Invasive diarrhea, or dysentery, is defined as diarrhea with visible blood or mucus, in contrast to watery diarrhea. Dysentery is commonly associated with fever and abdominal pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most cases of acute diarrhea are due to infections and are self-limited. The major causes of acute infectious diarrhea include viruses (norovirus, rotavirus, adenoviruses, astrovirus, and others), bacteria (<em>Salmonella</em>, <em>Campylobacter</em>, <em>Shigella</em>, enterotoxigenic <em>Escherichia coli</em>, <em>Clostridium difficile</em>, and others), and protozoa (<em>Cryptosporidium</em>, <em>Giardia</em>, <em>Cyclospora</em>, <em>Entamoeba</em>, and others) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F116097\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116097 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-acute-diarrhea-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Taken together, most cases of acute infectious diarrhea are likely viral, as indicated by the observation that stool cultures are positive in only 1.5 to 5.6 percent of cases in most studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-acute-diarrhea-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Among those with severe diarrhea, however, bacterial causes are responsible for most cases. As an example, in a study of 173 healthy adults with severe acute community-acquired diarrhea (defined in this study as &ge;4 fluid stools per day for more than three days), a bacterial pathogen was identified in 87 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-acute-diarrhea-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Protozoa are less commonly identified as the etiologic agents of acute gastrointestinal illness.</p><p>Noninfectious etiologies become more common as the course of the diarrhea persists and becomes chronic. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-chronic-diarrhea-in-resource-rich-settings\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with chronic diarrhea in resource-rich settings&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Exact data on the frequency of different causes of acute diarrhea vary according to the definition used, the diagnostic technology available, and the population studied. In addition, the prevalence of an identifiable infectious agent is probably grossly underestimated since many patients do not seek medical attention and testing is often not performed when patients do contact their clinician [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-acute-diarrhea-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

Hospitalization may be warranted in the presence of such concerns, in particular if there is a complex medical history of immunosuppression (eg, because of treatment for malignancy, history of transplantation, or advanced HIV infection) or significant vascular or cardiovascular disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3208048399\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial evaluation of patients who present to medical care with acute diarrhea should include a careful history to determine the duration of symptoms, the frequency and characteristics of the stool, and associated symptoms. Additionally, there should be an attempt to elicit evidence of extracellular volume depletion (eg, dark yellow or scant urine, decreased skin turgor, orthostatic hypotension). Questioning about potential exposures, such as food history, residence, occupational exposure, recent and remote travel, pets, and hobbies, can also provide further diagnostic clues. These historical elements can be helpful to suggest the potential causative pathogens (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F116097\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116097 \">table 1</a>), which in turn can inform additional work-up and the decision to use empiric antibiotic therapy. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Stool tests for bacterial pathogens'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2984949915\" class=\"local\">'Additional testing in specific circumstances'</a> below and <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Empiric antibiotic therapy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Character of symptoms</strong> &ndash; In addition to informing the severity of disease, details on the frequency and nature of the stool can suggest whether the diarrhea is originating in the small or the large bowel, and thus can suggest certain pathogens (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F81945\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81945 \">table 2</a>). Diarrhea of small bowel origin is typically watery, of large volume, and associated with abdominal cramping, bloating, and gas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-acute-diarrhea-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Weight loss can occur if diarrhea becomes persistent. Fever is rarely a significant symptom and occult blood or inflammatory cells in the stool are rarely identified. In contrast, diarrhea of large intestinal origin often presents with frequent, regular, small volume, and often painful bowel movements. Fever and bloody or mucoid stools are common, and red blood cells and inflammatory cells can be seen routinely on stool microscopy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">These inflammatory signs associated with large bowel infection (fever, bloody or mucoid stools) suggest invasive bacteria (eg, <em>Salmonella</em>, <em>Shigella</em>, or <em>Campylobacter</em>), enteric viruses (eg, cytomegalovirus [CMV] or adenovirus), <em>Entamoeba histolytica</em>, or a cytotoxic organism such as <em>C. difficile</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-acute-diarrhea-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Visibly bloody acute diarrhea is relatively uncommon and raises the possibility of enterohemorrhagic <em>E. coli</em> (EHEC) (eg, <em>E. coli O157:H7</em>) infection. Other bacterial causes of visibly bloody diarrhea are <em>Shigella</em>, <em>Campylobacter</em>, and <em>Salmonella</em> species. Bloody diarrhea can also reflect noninfectious etiologies such as inflammatory bowel disease or ischemic colitis.

As examples of medical history informing the likelihood of various pathogens, pregnancy increases the risk of listeriosis following consumption of contaminated meat products or unpasteurized dairy products approximately 20-fold, cirrhosis has been associated with <em>Vibrio</em> infection, and hemochromatosis has been associated with <em>Yersinia</em> infection. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1957910733\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The examination focuses on evaluating volume status and identifying complications. </p><p>Volume depletion can be suggested by dry mucous membranes, diminished skin turgor, postural or frank reductions in blood pressure, and altered sensorium.

The complete blood count does not reliably distinguish bacterial etiologies of diarrhea from others but may be helpful in suggesting severe disease or potential complications. A low platelet count may prompt concern for the development of the hemolytic-uremic syndrome, and a leukemoid reaction is consistent with the diagnosis of <em>C. difficile</em> infection.

If patients have exposures associated with certain other bacterial pathogens, special culture work-up may be warranted, as below.

Although the utility of fecal leukocytes in the evaluation of acute diarrhea in general is limited because variability of performance of this test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-acute-diarrhea-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>], the presence of bloody diarrhea in the absence of fecal leukocytes is suggestive of amebiasis, as these organisms destroy leukocytes. The fecal lactoferrin test is an agglutination assay that is also a marker for fecal leukocytes but may have greater accuracy because of fewer issues with user variability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-acute-diarrhea-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Another biomarker of intestinal inflammation is calprotectin, which serves mostly to determine activity of inflammatory bowel disease but has an uncertain role in infectious diarrhea. When there is bloody diarrhea with few or no fecal leukocytes, stool should be sent for evaluation for amebiasis, which can be diagnosed on stool by microscopy, antigen testing, or molecular methods.

The spectrum of parasites associated with persistent diarrhea can vary based on exposures or populations. In general, <em>Giardia</em>, <em>Cryptosporidium</em>, and <em>E. histolytica</em> are the most common parasitic pathogens in patients with persistent diarrhea. Persistent diarrhea following travel to certain locations, such as Russia, Nepal, or mountainous regions, is associated with <em>Giardia</em>, <em>Cryptosporidium</em>, or <em>Cyclospora</em>. Persistent diarrhea with exposure to infants in daycare centers has been associated with <em>Giardia</em> and <em>Cryptosporidium</em>. Microsporidium should be a consideration in immunocompromised patients with persistent diarrhea.</p><p>Most of these pathogens can be diagnosed by microscopy for ova and parasites. Three specimens should be sent on consecutive days (or each specimen separated by at least 24 hours) for ova and parasite examination since parasite excretion may be intermittent. Routine microscopy does not detect cryptosporidia spores; if suspected, the laboratory should be alerted to the potential diagnosis, and specific stains (eg, modified acid fast or trichrome stains) for the organisms should be requested. <em>Giardia</em>, <em>Cryptosporidium</em>, and <em>Entamoeba</em> can also be detected by antigen or molecular testing.

However, among patients with <em>Salmonella</em> infection, norfloxacin did not decrease time to clinical cure and increased the duration of <em>Salmonella </em>shedding from stool, similar to other studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-acute-diarrhea-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

The dose of loperamide is two tablets (4 mg) initially, then 2 mg after each unformed stool for &le;2 days, with a maximum of 16 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>. We avoid antimotility agents in patients with clinical features suggestive of dysentery (fever, bloody or mucoid stools) unless antibiotics are also given because of concerns that antimotility agents can prolong disease in such infections or lead to more severe illness. In such patients, bismuth salicylate (Pepto-Bismol, 30 mL or two tablets every 30 minutes for eight doses) is an acceptable alternative, although it is somewhat less effective and there is the potential for salicylate toxicity (especially in those who take <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> for any reason and pregnant women). Another antisecretory agent, racecadotril, is an effective option for symptomatic therapy, if available (not in the US). </p><p>Antimotility agents are effective but should be taken with caution. In several randomized controlled studies, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loperamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">loperamide</a> decreased the number of liquid bowel movements or the time to cessation of diarrhea compared with placebo (generally by approximately one day) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-acute-diarrhea-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. The addition of loperamide to antibiotics also decreases the time to symptom resolution compared with antibiotics alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-acute-diarrhea-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Diphenoxylate (Lomotil) is an alternative antimotility agent, but it has not been as well studied and may cause central opiate or cholinergic side effects. The dose of diphenoxylate is two tablets (4 mg) four times daily for &le;2 days. Patients should be cautioned that treatment with antimotility agents may mask the amount of fluid lost, since fluid may pool in the intestine. Thus, fluids should be used aggressively when antimotility agents are employed. Furthermore, there continues to be some concern that antimotility agents can prolong the duration of fever, diarrhea, and excretion of the organism in some types of dysenteric illnesses (eg, <em>Shigella</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-acute-diarrhea-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>], and so are avoided in such cases. </p><p>When compared with placebo, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bismuth-subsalicylate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bismuth subsalicylate</a> significantly reduced the number of unformed stools and increased the proportion of patients free of symptoms at the end of treatment trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-acute-diarrhea-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/48-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-50</a>].

A role for bismuth subsalicylate may be in patients with significant fever and dysentery, conditions in which loperamide should be avoided. If used, the total dose of bismuth salicylate should be monitored, especially in pregnant women, to prevent salicylate toxicity. </p><p>If available, racecadotril, an enkephalinase inhibitor, has been demonstrated in several studies to reduce the output and duration of diarrhea, and in some studies, leads to more rapid improvement with fewer adverse effects compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loperamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">loperamide</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-adult-with-acute-diarrhea-in-resource-rich-settings/abstract/53-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">53-55</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H224267459\"><span class=\"h2\">Probiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Probiotics with beneficial bacteria that assist in maintaining or recolonizing the intestine with nonpathogenic flora can also be used as alternative therapy.

Overall, most cases of infectious diarrhea are likely viral; however, bacterial causes are responsible for most cases of severe diarrhea. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most adults with acute diarrhea do not present to medical care because of the mild or transient nature of the symptoms. For those who present to medical care, the initial evaluation should assess for extracellular volume depletion (eg, dark yellow urine or scant amount of urine, decreased skin turgor, orthostatic hypotension) and determine the duration of symptoms, the frequency and characteristics of the stool, and associated symptoms (eg, fever and peritoneal signs). (See <a href=\"#H3208048399\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1957910733\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inflammatory features (eg, fever, or bloody or mucoid stool) suggest infection of the large bowel, which is associated with pathogens distinct from small bowel infection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F81945\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81945 \">table 2</a>). Potential exposures, such as food history, residence, occupational exposure, recent and remote travel, pets, and hobbies, can also provide further diagnostic clues as to potential microbiologic etiology (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F116097\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116097 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3208048399\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients, it is reasonable to continue expectant management for several days without performing microbiologic stool tests (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F68348\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef68348 \">algorithm 1</a>). However, we obtain standard stool cultures (or multiplex molecular testing, if culture is not available) for patients with acute community-acquired diarrhea and the following features at presentation (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Stool tests for bacterial pathogens'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Severe illness (profuse watery diarrhea, signs of hypovolemia, passage of &ge;6 unformed stools per 24 hours, severe abdominal pain, need for hospitalization)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Features of inflammatory diarrhea (bloody diarrhea, small volume mucous stools, fever)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>High-risk host features (eg, age &ge;70 years, cardiac disease, immunocompromising condition, inflammatory bowel disease, pregnancy)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Symptoms persisting for more than one week</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Public health concerns (eg, diarrheal illness in food handlers, health care workers, and individuals in day care centers)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Further diagnostic testing depends on the presenting features. Grossly bloody diarrhea warrants testing for Shiga toxin (to identify enterohemorrhagic <em>Escherichia coli</em> [EHEC]) and fecal leukocytes or lactoferrin, if available. Testing for <em>Clostridium difficile</em> should be performed in cases of recent antibiotic use or health care exposure. Testing for parasites is not warranted in the majority of patients with acute diarrhea. It is useful, however, in patients with persistent diarrhea, in men who have sex with men, in immunocompromised hosts, during a community waterborne outbreak (associated with <em>Giardia</em> and <em>Cryptosporidium</em>), or with bloody diarrhea with few or no fecal leukocytes (associated with intestinal amebiasis). Parasitic tests include microscopy for ova and parasites as well as antigen or molecular testing for specific organisms. (See <a href=\"#H2984949915\" class=\"local\">'Additional testing in specific circumstances'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most critical therapy in diarrheal illness is volume repletion, preferably by the oral route, with solutions that contain water, salt, and sugar. Adults with severe hypovolemia should initially receive intravenous fluid repletion. Once they are replete, they can be switched to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oral-rehydration-solutions-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oral rehydration solutions</a>. Adequate nutrition during an episode of acute diarrhea is also important, but a short period of consuming only non-dairy liquids will not be harmful. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Fluid repletion'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4120768861\" class=\"local\">'Dietary recommendations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients with community-acquired, non-travel-associated diarrhea, we recommend not routinely administering empiric antibiotic therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F68348\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef68348 \">algorithm 1</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Antibiotic therapy can reduce the duration of diarrhea and other symptoms by several days, but potential drawbacks include side effects, promotion of bacterial resistance, eradication of normal flora (and increased susceptibility to <em>C. difficile</em> infection), and cost. The benefit of symptom reduction does not outweigh these drawbacks in most individuals with acute diarrhea, which is usually short-lived and caused by viruses.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>However, for select patients, empiric antibiotic treatment may have a greater relative benefit. We suggest empiric antibiotic therapy for patients with severe disease, features suggestive of invasive bacterial infection (bloody or mucoid stools), or host factors that increase the risk for complications (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H449436376\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">For most adults with highly symptomatic or severe bloody diarrhea, the benefits of antibiotic therapy likely outweigh the low risk of potential complications from treating EHEC. It is reasonable to withhold empiric antibiotic therapy pending stool testing to rule out EHEC or Shiga toxin production in stable patients when the likelihood of EHEC is higher (eg, bloody diarrhea in the setting of an outbreak or in an afebrile patient). (See <a href=\"#H449436376\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients in whom empiric antibiotic therapy is warranted, we suggest treatment with a fluoroquinolone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Fluoroquinolones are given for three to five days. If fluoroquinolones are contraindicated or if fluoroquinolone resistance is suspected (eg, diarrhea after travel to Southeast Asia or during outbreaks of resistant pathogens), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azithromycin</a> is an effective alternative. (See <a href=\"#H1175232357\" class=\"local\">'Choice of agent'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3510394725\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Even if a bacterial pathogen is identified, not all patients warrant antimicrobial therapy, and EHEC specifically should <strong>not</strong> be treated with antibiotics. Indications for and selection of antimicrobial therapy for specific intestinal pathogens are discussed in detail in the appropriate topic reviews. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nontyphoidal-salmonella-gastrointestinal-infection-and-carriage#H1058721973\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nontyphoidal Salmonella: Gastrointestinal infection and carriage&quot;, section on 'Antimicrobial therapy'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=shigella-infection-treatment-and-prevention-in-adults#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Shigella infection: Treatment and prevention in adults&quot;, section on 'Management'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-campylobacter-infection#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of Campylobacter infection&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-enterohemorrhagic-escherichia-coli-ehec-infection#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis and treatment of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) infection&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who desire symptomatic therapy, the antimotility agent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loperamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">loperamide</a> can be used cautiously in patients in whom fever is absent or low grade and the stools are not bloody. For patients with clinical features suggestive of dysentery (fever, bloody or mucoid stools), we suggest avoiding antimotility agents unless antibiotics are also given because of concerns of prolonging disease in such infections (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
