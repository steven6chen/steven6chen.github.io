Some have symptoms or signs that are directly referable to the kidney (such as hematuria) or to associated extrarenal manifestations (edema, hypertension, signs of uremia). Many patients are asymptomatic and are incidentally found to have an elevated serum creatinine concentration, abnormal urine studies (such as proteinuria or microscopic hematuria), or abnormal radiologic imaging of the kidneys.</p><p>Specific disorders generally cause acute, subacute, or chronic kidney injury. Acute kidney injury (AKI) develops over hours to days and is usually diagnosed in hospitalized patients or following a procedure. Subacute kidney injury defines a presentation that develops more slowly than AKI but generally results in worsening creatinine in less than three months. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is defined by an elevated creatinine, or other evidence of kidney damage, that is relatively stable for greater than three months.</p><p>Although not all presentations fit within these narrowly defined categories, knowledge of the duration and acuity of onset of disease often narrows the differential diagnosis among patients who may present similar clinical findings related to the kidney.</p><p>This topic reviews the evaluation of patients who present with subacute kidney injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-adult-patients-with-subacute-kidney-injury-in-an-outpatient-setting/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Most patients are evaluated as outpatients, but, in some cases, the trend of gradually rising creatinine is recognized upon hospital admission. The evaluation of hospitalized patients who develop an increase in creatinine within hours to days is discussed elsewhere [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-adult-patients-with-subacute-kidney-injury-in-an-outpatient-setting/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Making this determination accurately requires the availability of older data for comparison. Knowing the disease duration helps to narrow the differential diagnosis of cause and to provide prognostic information to guide management.</p><p>The distinction among acute kidney injury (AKI), subacute injury, and chronic kidney disease (CKD) is arbitrary, but the following definitions have been established by consensus panels:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acute</strong> &ndash; AKI is defined by a rise in the serum creatinine concentration or an abnormal urinalysis that has developed within hours to days. Consensus criteria for AKI include an increase in serum creatinine by &ge;0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (27 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> relative to a known baseline value within 48 hours, or an increase to &ge;1.5 times the known or presumed baseline value within seven days, or a decrease in urine volume to &lt;3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> over six hours (Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes [KDIGO]-AKI) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F83168\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83168 \">table 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">AKI is most commonly diagnosed in hospitalized patients.

Disorders that evolve over more than 48 hours but generally in under three months are informally referred to here as subacute kidney injury. AKD includes both AKI and subacute kidney injury, and there is considerable overlap in an acute and subacute presentation.</p><p/><p>We emphasize that these categories are less important in the clinical setting than having a clear understanding of the natural history of the underlying diseases. Many signs and symptoms of disease may be present before there is a decline in clearance function. As an example, glomerular diseases referred to as rapidly progressive glomerulonephritides (RPGNs) often cause subtle signs and symptoms for weeks to months before the patient develops overt manifestations of nephritic syndrome, including a decline in clearance. In two case-series reports of antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) vasculitis, for example, an average time of &ge;10 weeks elapsed between reported, initial symptoms and the diagnosis of glomerulonephritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-adult-patients-with-subacute-kidney-injury-in-an-outpatient-setting/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>The assessment of disease duration is best performed by comparing the current serum creatinine concentration <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> urinalysis with previous results. As an example, a patient with a current serum creatinine concentration of 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (354 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> and a creatinine of 0.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (53 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> one month previously has acute or subacute disease. In contrast, the same patient with a prior serum creatinine concentration of 3.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (309 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> two years ago almost certainly has slowly progressive CKD.</p><p>When a previous urinalysis, serum creatinine concentration, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiographic study are unavailable, certain findings from the history and physical examination may suggest the duration of disease. As examples [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-adult-patients-with-subacute-kidney-injury-in-an-outpatient-setting/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The recent onset of symptoms or signs, such as sudden onset of anasarca and discolored urine, suggests an acute process.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Marked oliguria (urine output &lt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/day)</span> or anuria indicates an acute process since prolonged <span class=\"nowrap\">oliguria/anuria</span> does not occur in slowly progressive CKD (even if advanced) prior to initiation of maintenance dialysis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A daily progressive increase in the serum creatinine concentration indicates an acute process, while a stable value suggests CKD.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Imaging showing small kidneys provides definitive evidence of chronicity. However, the presence of normal-sized kidneys does <strong>not</strong> exclude chronic disease. Markedly increased renal echogenicity coupled with small, atrophic kidneys strongly suggest CKD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-adult-patients-with-subacute-kidney-injury-in-an-outpatient-setting/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>].

As an example, anemia due to erythropoietin deficiency is a common (though not absolute) finding in CKD, but many conditions can cause both hemolysis or bleeding and AKI or subacute injury. Hyperphosphatemia also does not distinguish acute from chronic disease. Although hyperphosphatemia commonly affects CKD patients, serum phosphorus levels can also rise quickly in AKI or subacute kidney injury.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MAJOR CAUSES AND PATHOGENESIS OF KIDNEY DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The traditional approach to kidney disease has been to categorize the clinical etiology as prerenal (decreased renal perfusion pressure), intrinsic renal (pathology of the vessels, glomeruli, or tubulointerstitium), or postrenal (obstructive).</p><p>However, diseases often cross these nosological boundaries. As examples, prolonged prerenal azotemia can lead to intrinsic acute tubular necrosis (ATN) and possibly to chronic fibrosis and progressive chronic kidney disease (CKD), and untreated urinary tract obstruction eventually causes fibrosis and atrophy of the obstructed kidney(s). In addition, many diseases that initially damage the glomeruli eventually result in tubulointerstitial fibrosis. Another example is cholesterol emboli syndrome, which affects both small vessels and the glomeruli and ultimately causes tubulointerstitial fibrosis.</p><p>Conditions that cause prerenal, intrinsic, or postrenal subacute kidney injury are discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Prerenal disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prerenal conditions that cause subacute kidney injury include overdiuresis, decreased oral intake, diarrhea, or unreplenished insensible losses. Renal perfusion pressure may also be low in hypervolemic states with low effective circulating (arterial) volume, such as heart failure with reduced ejection fraction or decompensated liver disease with portal hypertension.

However, AKI, especially if severe or frequently recurrent, may not recover completely, resulting in irreversible CKD. In such patients, if the elevated creatinine is identified within three months, it may be erroneously &quot;classified&quot; as subacute kidney injury. Causes of AKI are often easily identified in the history, such as cardiac surgery or severe sepsis, and chronicity can be established by close follow-up of the patient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Obstructive nephropathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Obstruction may occur anywhere in the urinary tract. Among patients who do not have underlying CKD, a substantial reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) suggests bilateral obstruction (or unilateral obstruction of a single functioning kidney). This is most commonly due to prostatic disease (hyperplasia or cancer) or metastatic cancer. Retroperitoneal fibrosis is a rare cause of chronic ureteral obstruction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of retroperitoneal fibrosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Acute obstruction of the urinary tract usually causes symptoms of pain (renal colic or suprapubic fullness), but gradual, severe obstruction may cause renal dysfunction without obvious symptoms. If untreated, obstructive nephropathy leads to irreversible tubulointerstitial fibrosis (ie, intrinsic disease).

These include edema, hypertension, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> decreased urine output. Patients with rheumatologic diseases affecting the kidney may have subtle joint or skin manifestations. However, many patients have no clinical symptoms. In such patients, kidney injury is detected by laboratory tests that are obtained, potentially as part of an evaluation of an unrelated disorder.</p><p>Symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> signs of prolonged renal failure, including weakness and easy fatigability, anorexia, vomiting, mental status changes, and seizures, are generally not present in patients with subacute injury, although exceptions may occur. Such symptoms suggest severe acute kidney injury (AKI) or advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD).</p><p>The total absence of urine (anuria) is never observed with subacute injury and always indicates AKI. Anuria occurs as a result of shock, bilateral urinary tract obstruction, pregnancy-related cortical necrosis, or any process that causes severe, prolonged loss of renal perfusion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-acute-kidney-injury-among-hospitalized-adult-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of acute kidney injury among hospitalized adult patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The major, and occasionally the only, laboratory finding in patients with subacute kidney injury is an increased serum creatinine concentration. Increased urea (blood urea nitrogen [BUN]) and hyperkalemia may also be present. Albuminuria <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> abnormal urine microscopy may be present. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Urinalysis'</a> below.)</p><p>Incidental findings (eg, multiple renal cysts suggestive of polycystic kidney disease [PKD]) may be observed on radiographic imaging performed for some other reason.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H69019125\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once kidney disease is discovered and determined to be subacute in onset, the underlying cause should be identified, if possible. Frequently helpful are a careful history, review of medications, and physical examination (eg, signs of volume contraction).</p><p>The presence of certain symptoms or signs may suggest an underlying diagnosis. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Systemic symptoms and findings, such as fever, arthralgias, and pulmonary lesions, are suggestive of a systemic disease such as vasculitis or lupus.

As examples, hypertension, hematuria with red cell casts, and a rapidly rising serum creatinine concentration are almost certainly due to acute glomerulonephritis or renal vasculitis. Edema, heavy proteinuria, and little or no hematuria are indicative of a nonproliferative (nephrotic) glomerular disease such as diabetic nephropathy, membranous nephropathy, or minimal change disease. Some other urinary findings are relatively nonspecific (eg, a normal or near-normal urinalysis) and can be observed in a variety of disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F56160\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56160 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinalysis-in-the-diagnosis-of-kidney-disease#H30\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinalysis in the diagnosis of kidney disease&quot;, section on 'Correlation of urinary findings with kidney diseases'</a>.)</p><p>The approach to evaluation varies among clinicians and depends on the degree of creatinine change and the corresponding change in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which is estimated from the serum creatinine. We define mild injury as a serum creatinine that is increased to &lt;0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> above baseline and moderate to severe injury as a serum creatinine that is increased to &ge;0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> above baseline. However, the absolute change in creatinine should be evaluated in the context of the baseline creatinine. For patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and thus a higher creatinine at baseline, small fluctuations in creatinine are common. For such patients, mild injury may be better defined as a less than 50 percent change in creatinine and moderate to severe injury defined as a greater than 50 percent change in creatinine. Among patients with a relatively low baseline serum creatinine, smaller changes may reflect a significant reduction in kidney function. For example, if a patient has a baseline serum creatinine of 0.6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> an increase of 0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> is significant.</p><p>For most patients with mild injury, we follow a stepwise approach that begins with assessment of volume status and the exclusion of drugs that are nephrotoxins or cause prerenal azotemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F105741\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef105741 \">algorithm 1</a>). Common examples of such agents are nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs), angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), and diuretics. We repeat the serum creatinine in one to two weeks.</p><p>If, on repeat testing, the creatinine remains elevated, we perform laboratory and radiographic tests as described below. (See <a href=\"#H1059454498\" class=\"local\">'Initial testing'</a> below.)</p><p>For patients who have moderate or severe injury, we initiate the laboratory and radiographic evaluation immediately (ie, concurrent with holding potential nephrotoxins and restoring euvolemia).

Some clinicians also send a serum and urine protein electrophoresis (SPEP and UPEP) at the time of the initial evaluation and, if these are abnormal, a free light chain assay.</p><p>Among all patients who are considered at higher risk for multiple myeloma based on key clinical features, we obtain a SPEP and UPEP, with immunofixation, and a serum light chain assay at the time of the initial evaluation. Patients who are considered at higher risk for myeloma include all patients who are &gt;40 years of age who have a documented increase in the serum creatinine within three to six months and no other obvious cause for increased creatinine, such as NSAID use or contrast exposure. Patients who have other manifestations consistent with myeloma are also considered at high risk regardless of whether the creatinine increase is documented to be within three to six months; such manifestations include hypercalcemia, bone pain or radiographic lesions, or anemia that is disproportionate to CKD and otherwise unexplained.

Manual urine microscopy for the assessment of urine sediment is best performed by an experienced operator.</p><p>We perform imaging in all patients with subacute injury and in those with an increased serum creatinine of unclear duration. In most patients, we perform a renal ultrasound rather than other imaging modalities.

Some glomerular diseases may be rapidly progressive, and timely serology and biopsy evaluations followed by appropriate immunosuppression can drastically improve morbidity associated with them.

Because of its improved sensitivity over spot UPEP in detecting light chain disease, some clinicians obtain a serum free light chain assay initially rather than SPEP or UPEP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnostic-approach-to-adult-patients-with-subacute-kidney-injury-in-an-outpatient-setting/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p/><p>The recognition of monoclonal gammopathy by serum or urine electrophoresis or by abnormal ratio of light chains in a patient with kidney disease of uncertain etiology may prompt renal biopsy for definitive diagnosis. Discussion of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), myeloma, and amyloidosis are presented elsewhere.

Among patients who have mild injury, the serum creatinine may be repeated in one to two weeks. If the creatinine remains stable, we generally continue to follow it intermittently, until a clear temporal pattern is established. Among patients who have signs and symptoms of rapidly progressive or unexplained systemic disease, a renal biopsy may be warranted, even if the estimated GFR (eGFR) is near normal.</p><p>If the creatinine is markedly elevated on initial evaluation without a clear explanation or if an initially mild increase in the creatinine worsens over the course of weeks to months, then a kidney biopsy should be performed, providing there is no clear evidence of chronicity on imaging. A biopsy generally provides more definitive tissue diagnosis and may allow a therapeutic intervention to stave off progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD).</p><p>In some cases, even without kidney biopsy, the etiology of kidney disease can be ascertained with reasonable certainty with tissue diagnosis from other sites. As an example, a bone marrow biopsy among patients with monoclonal gammopathy or a fat pad biopsy among those with amyloidosis may avert the need for a kidney biopsy. Renal biopsy is discussed below and in more detail elsewhere (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indications-for-and-complications-of-renal-biopsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Indications for and complications of renal biopsy&quot;</a>). Additional testing prior to biopsy may also be suggested by the history. As an example, determining lead levels may be indicated among patients with a history of lead exposure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lead-nephropathy-and-lead-related-nephrotoxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lead nephropathy and lead-related nephrotoxicity&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Estimation of glomerular filtration rate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common methods utilized to estimate the GFR in adults are the serum creatinine concentration, the creatinine clearance, and GFR estimation equations based upon the serum creatinine concentration and variables such as age, sex, and race. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-kidney-function#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of kidney function&quot;, section on 'Estimation of GFR'</a>.)</p><p>The equations that use serum creatinine concentration to estimate GFR were derived in patients with stable kidney function. The use of these equations may lead to errors in estimation of kidney function among patients who are not in steady state, such as those with acute kidney injury (AKI), in whom the GFR is often markedly reduced upon presentation, but there has not yet been adequate time for creatinine concentration to equilibrate. Measuring the serum creatinine over time often allows one to determine whether there is sufficient stability to use estimation equations.

Normal urine output can be maintained even with an abnormally low GFR, as in nonoliguric ATN or in many patients with CKD. As noted above, clear evidence that a patient has become oliguric or anuric, whether by reliable history or by physical exam of volume overload, should prompt more urgent (or emergent) evaluation since oliguria and certainly anuria suggest an AKI or the late stages of a subacute kidney injury.
