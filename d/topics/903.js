In ex-premature infants and children, there are high rates of long-term neurodevelopment impairment and chronic health problems, and an increase in conditions that require surgery and anesthesia compared with full-term infants.</p><p>Ex-premature infants and children include a heterogeneous population, ranging from healthy children born at 36 weeks gestation to formerly extremely premature children with significant medical issues that affect anesthetic care.</p><p>Outside of the neonatal period, the most common surgical procedures performed in these children are inguinal hernia repair and ophthalmologic procedures (often due to underlying retinopathy of prematurity). After even minor surgical procedures, ex-premature infants are at higher risk for postoperative apnea than infants born at term.</p><p>This topic will discuss the anesthetic management of children who undergo surgical procedures outside of the neonatal period.

Apnea has been variably defined, most commonly as a pause in breathing &ge;15 seconds, or one &lt;15 seconds associated with bradycardia (ie, heart rate &lt;80 beats per minute). Apneic events vary in severity; studies have reported episodes that resolved spontaneously, others that resolved with stimulation, and some life-threatening events that required bag-mask ventilation or cardiopulmonary resuscitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-ex-premature-infants-and-children/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>].</p><p>Based on both retrospective and prospective studies including heterogeneous patient populations, anesthetic techniques, and monitoring methods, the risk of having at least one postoperative apneic episode has been reported at between 5 and 49 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-ex-premature-infants-and-children/abstract/2-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2108699197\"><span class=\"h3\">Risk factors for postoperative apnea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk factors for postoperative apnea include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Postmenstrual and gestational ages</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>Postmenstrual age (PMA) is the most important risk factor for postoperative apnea in ex-premature infants, with gestational age (GA) as the next most important variable. A combined analysis of data from eight prospective studies reported that postoperative apnea was strongly and inversely related to PMA and, to a slightly lesser degree, GA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-ex-premature-infants-and-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. As PMA increases, the probability of apnea decreases, holding GA constant. Likewise, as GA increases, the probability of apnea decreases, holding PMA constant. However, the effect of increasing GA is slightly more than half the effect of increasing PMA. Thus, the risk of apnea in the preterm infant without anemia or apnea in the immediate postoperative period decreases to less than 5 percent at a PMA of 50 weeks with a GA of 35 weeks, or a PMA of 52 weeks with a GA of 32 weeks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Apnea at home</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>Episodes of apnea at home seem to predispose patients to postoperative apnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-ex-premature-infants-and-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].<strong> </strong>Infants with a variety of medical conditions associated with prematurity may be monitored for apnea at home (eg, persistent apnea of prematurity, neurologic or metabolic disorders affecting respiratory control, and chronic lung disease).

PFTs frequently show decreased forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV<sub>1</sub>) and decreased ratios of FEV<sub>1</sub> to forced vital capacity (FVC) (FEV<sub>1</sub>:FVC), consistent with airflow limitation and small airway obstruction. Many children with BPD also have a reactive component to their obstructive lung disease as demonstrated by their clinical response to steroids and bronchodilators or hyperreactivity to challenge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-ex-premature-infants-and-children/abstract/11,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,21</a>].

Airway obstruction may occur during induction of anesthesia, and a smaller-diameter endotracheal tube may be needed. Infants who have had a procedure to relieve airway obstruction may be at risk for chronic airway difficulty and increased risk of aspiration related to limited motion and decreased sensation of supraglottic tissue. The rate of aspiration may be 6 percent, with the highest incidence occurring in the former extremely preterm infant (&lt;28 weeks GA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-ex-premature-infants-and-children/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2580703201\"><span class=\"h2\">Neurodevelopmental disabilities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ex-premature infants and children, especially those with severe neonatal brain injury, are more likely than term infants and children to have neurodevelopmental disabilities, including impaired cognitive skills, motor deficits and cerebral palsy, vision and hearing loss, and behavioral and psychological problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-ex-premature-infants-and-children/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>].

We prefer to use age-appropriate distraction techniques (eg, parental presence, toys, video games, stickers) prior to anesthesia for most pediatric patients, rather than sedatives. Premedication with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=midazolam-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">midazolam</a>, a benzodiazepine commonly used in this setting, may be associated with a higher risk of respiratory complications during and after anesthesia.

Other monitors have included apnea impedance monitoring, impedance pneumograms, and pneumocardiograms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-ex-premature-infants-and-children/abstract/4,6,35,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6,35,39</a>].</p><p/><p>Each institution that cares for ex-premature infants and children should create guidelines for postoperative monitoring and ensure availability of personnel experienced with the care of these patients. Our approach to postoperative monitoring for ex-premature infants is designed to be simple and easily followed:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For ex-premature infants with PMA &le;60 weeks, we monitor using continuous pulse oximetry, ECG, and recovery room level of nursing care overnight.

(See <a href=\"#H1353851777\" class=\"local\">'Postoperative apnea'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gestational age (GA) is defined as the time elapsed between the first day of the last menstrual period and the day of delivery. Post menstrual age is defined as GA plus chronological age.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The most important risk factor for postoperative apnea is postmenstrual age (PMA). Other risk factors include GA, apnea at home, anemia, neurologic disease, and a complicated postnatal history. For otherwise healthy ex-premature infants, we suggest delaying elective surgery until 60 weeks PMA (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1353851777\" class=\"local\">'Postoperative apnea'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prematurity may be associated with a number of comorbidities that can affect anesthetic management, including bronchopulmonary dysplasia, neurodevelopmental disabilities, gastrointestinal disorders, and cardiac abnormalities. (See <a href=\"#H2916263872\" class=\"local\">'Preanesthetic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We use distraction techniques rather than sedative premedication in ex-premature children. (See <a href=\"#H2525897793\" class=\"local\">'Premedication'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We administer general anesthesia for most surgical procedures for ex-premature infants. For appropriate surgical procedures, spinal anesthesia may reduce the incidence of early postoperative apnea compared with general anesthesia, but it does not reduce the overall incidence of apnea and need for postoperative monitoring, and is associated with a high failure rate. (See <a href=\"#H922308101\" class=\"local\">'Regional versus general anesthesia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We administer inhalation anesthesia with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sevoflurane-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sevoflurane</a> for most ex-premature infants and avoid long-acting opioids and neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs). (See <a href=\"#H1170758600\" class=\"local\">'Maintenance of general anesthesia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We use a multimodal approach to postoperative pain control, which may include local anesthetic infiltration, peripheral nerve blocks, neuraxial techniques, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">acetaminophen</a>.
