The ultimate response of a cell to its environment is determined by the balance of stimulatory and inhibitory factors present at a given moment and acting on different receptors.</p><p>This topic review will discuss the activating and inhibitory receptors on mast cells and signal transduction mechanisms. The information in this review pertains to human mast cells whenever possible, and notation is made when data are derived purely from murine studies. Mast cell-derived mediators, as well as the development, identification, and physiologic roles of mast cells, are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mast-cell-derived-mediators\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mast cell-derived mediators&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mast-cells-development-identification-and-physiologic-roles\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mast cells: Development, identification, and physiologic roles&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ACTIVATING RECEPTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Important stimulatory receptors on the surface of mast cells include the high-affinity immunoglobulin E (IgE) receptor, immunoglobulin G (IgG) receptors, toll-like receptors (TLRs), receptors for stem cell factor (SCF), complement proteins, cytokine receptors (eg, for the alarmins interleukin-33 [IL-33] and thymic stromal lymphopoietin [TSLP]), neuropeptides, and opioids. A G-coupled protein receptor that is important in anaphylactoid reactions, MRGPRX2, was identified in 2015 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cells-surface-receptors-and-signal-transduction/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">High affinity IgE receptor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Classical mast cell activation occurs through the high affinity immunoglobulin E (IgE) receptor, Fc-epsilon-RI. Activation occurs when adjacent receptors, occupied by receptor-bound IgE, are crosslinked by a multivalent antigen. This is a strong stimulus for degranulation and release of preformed mediators, as well as for de novo production and subsequent release of leukotrienes, prostaglandins, and cytokines, including numerous chemokines. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mast-cell-derived-mediators\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mast cell-derived mediators&quot;</a>.)</p><p>High and low valency or affinity antigens are able to trigger differential responses through Fc-epsilon-RI receptors. High affinity or high valency antigens trigger classic degranulation and cytokine responses with neutrophilic inflammation. In contrast, low valency or low affinity allergens may not trigger degranulation, but can still trigger production of chemokines that recruit macrophages and monocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cells-surface-receptors-and-signal-transduction/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>IgE is involved in defense against parasitic infection and in hypersensitivity reactions. It is estimated that there are usually &gt;100,000 Fc-epsilon-RI receptors on the surface of each human mast cell, although the number can vary with activation state and the presence of circulating IgE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cells-surface-receptors-and-signal-transduction/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. As the transcript is stabilized by binding of monomeric IgE to the receptor, there is a greater number of receptors and hence capacity for binding serum IgE in atopic individuals. This likely accounts for this large range in the number of receptors per cell and the efficacy of therapy directed to reducing the serum titer of IgE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cells-surface-receptors-and-signal-transduction/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H174337300\" class=\"local\">'Clinical applications'</a> below.)</p><p>The fully functional form of the Fc-epsilon-RI receptor on mast cells and on basophils is a tetrameric structure consisting of one alpha chain, one beta chain, and two gamma chains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cells-surface-receptors-and-signal-transduction/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The alpha chain contains two extracellular domains that bind IgE with high affinity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The beta chain transverses the membrane four times and may form an ion pore.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The two gamma chains, which are structurally homologous to the zeta chain of the T cell receptor, each have two cytoplasmic <strong>i</strong>mmunoreceptor <strong>t</strong>yrosine <strong>a</strong>ctivation <strong>m</strong>otifs (ITAMs) and mediate signal transduction.</p><p/><p>Several other human cell types express a trimeric form of Fc-epsilon-RI, which lacks the beta chain.

These receptors allow activation of the cells by immune complexes that are either circulating or formed in situ. Human mast cells can also transiently express Fc-gamma-RI, another activating receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cells-surface-receptors-and-signal-transduction/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Kit (stem cell factor receptor)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mast cells express Kit, the receptor for stem cell factor (SCF), which is the critical growth factor for mast cell development.

Both of these can be released from activated epithelium. The epithelium releases an alternatively spliced form of IL-33, which in combination with TSLP, activates mast cells. This pathway is likely important in various responses occurring at environmental interfaces. For instance, together with basophils, this pathway for mast cell activation has been implicated in driving the type 2 inflammation in some patients with asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cells-surface-receptors-and-signal-transduction/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Complement receptors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mast cells in human skin express receptors for both the anaphylatoxins, C3a and C5a, and release histamine in response to exposure to these complement fragments. These provide additional mechanisms in which immune complexes or microbes may activate mast cells that may occur via classical or alternative complement activation pathways. However, in contrast to activation through Fc-epsilon-RI, exocytosis by complement fragments is not associated with the generation of prostaglandins or leukotrienes. There is some variability in distribution of complement receptors, as some cardiac mast cells demonstrate a functional receptor for C5a (CD88) by immunofluorescence, whereas mast cells isolated from the human lung, uterus, or tonsils do not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cells-surface-receptors-and-signal-transduction/abstract/28-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-31</a>].

The activation of mast cells through TLRs is an important mechanism through which mast cells serve as a bridge between the innate and adaptive immune systems. Using cultured human mast cell lines, these cells have been shown to express TLRs 1 through 9, although TLR8 was lost with continued culture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cells-surface-receptors-and-signal-transduction/abstract/32-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">32-34</a>].</p><p>Human mast cells also can be activated by many of the ligands specific to the different receptors (eg, peptidoglycans through TLR2, double-stranded RNA through TLR3, and lipopolysaccharide [LPS] through TLR4). In broad terms, mast cells respond to activation through TLR with the production of inflammatory cytokines, rather than degranulation, yet the responses to the different stimuli are distinct. Thus, double-stranded RNA induces expression of the type 1 interferons, but not tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) or interleukin-6 (IL-6), while LPS induces expression of these two proinflammatory cytokines, but not degranulation as occurs following peptidoglycan stimulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cells-surface-receptors-and-signal-transduction/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].

The following are examples of therapeutic applications that have either already been realized or are in development:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The high affinity immunoglobulin E (IgE) receptor can be downregulated on the surface of mast cells by administration of the anti-IgE therapy <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omalizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">omalizumab</a>. This agent binds free IgE in the serum and tissues and clears it from circulation, resulting in a reduction in the number of Fc-epsilon-RI receptors present on mast cells (and basophils). Anti-IgE therapy is used in the treatment of allergic asthma. It has also been successfully administered to patients with Hymenoptera venom-induced anaphylaxis who require venom immunotherapy, but who have reactions to the injections, to improve the safety of the vaccination process. In the future, its use may be extended to other diseases in which IgE is part of the pathophysiology, including allergic rhinitis and anaphylaxis. The use of anti-IgE therapy in asthma and chronic idiopathic urticaria is reviewed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anti-ige-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anti-IgE therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The receptor for stem cell factor (SCF), Kit, is a tyrosine kinase. PKC412 (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=midostaurin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">midostaurin</a>) is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits Kit, including Kit with a specific D816V mutation, while <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imatinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imatinib</a> (Gleevec) inhibits only wild-type Kit. Patients with aggressive forms of systemic mastocytosis have benefited from these drugs, providing evidence that activation of Kit is a fundamental part of the pathophysiology of the disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-mastocytosis-management-and-prognosis#H3622787715\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic mastocytosis: Management and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Midostaurin'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Analogs of the parasite product ES-62, an agonist of toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), are in development. The action of ES-62 at TLR4 leads to inhibition of Fc-epsilon-RI. It is hoped that these agents could be used as immunomodulators to treat or prevent allergic and other inflammatory diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cells-surface-receptors-and-signal-transduction/abstract/86,87\" class=\"abstract_t\">86,87</a>].

For example, the major cat allergen, Fel d 1, has been fused with Fc-gamma-I and is being studied for use in safer and more effective forms of immunotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mast-cells-surface-receptors-and-signal-transduction/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Syk inhibitors have been studied to block signal transduction in mast cells and prevent activation at the time of allergen exposure, and their application in allergic rhinitis and asthma is under study. However, the potential side effects of blocking signal transduction are complex, due to the broad functions of Syk in T cells and other immune cells.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mast cells display a host of stimulatory and inhibitory surface receptors, and the balance of signals arising from these receptors at a given moment determines the ultimate response of the cell.
