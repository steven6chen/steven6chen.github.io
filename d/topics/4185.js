Subsequently, clonidine has been primarily utilized for its potent antihypertensive effect, but is used on- and off-label for a wide variety of indications. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guanfacine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Guanfacine</a>, and the antispasticity agent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tizanidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tizanidine</a>, are also oral central alpha-2 adrenergic agonist medications that are being more commonly prescribed. Related imidazolines are found in topical eye and nose decongestants. In the United States, nearly 9000 calls regarding clonidine exposure are made annually to regional poison control centers, and serious clinical findings often requiring hospitalization are common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clonidine-and-related-imidazoline-poisoning/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. As an example, among about 28,000 unintentional clonidine exposures in US children reported to poison control centers over 11 years, approximately 20 percent had moderate or major clinical effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clonidine-and-related-imidazoline-poisoning/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Clonidine</a> poisoning may occur from exploratory ingestion by young children, transdermal exposure from a clonidine patch, malicious drug administration, suicidal ingestion, or therapeutic error.

(See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features and diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ingestion of as little as one <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonidine</a> tablet or one swallow of imidazoline containing eye drops is a serious exposure in children. (See <a href=\"#H30\" class=\"local\">'Additional pediatric considerations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonidine</a> poisoning relies on a careful history and physical examination. Most signs of toxicity are seen within one hour of ingestion of clonidine tablets and new findings rarely appear more than four hours after exposure. Clonidine patch exposure through ingestion or self-application to the skin may develop signs of toxicity beyond four hours. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features and diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Almost all <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonidine</a> poisoned patients will have good outcomes with attentive supportive care of airway, breathing, and circulation. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Basic measures'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient should be fully exposed and any adherent transdermal patches should be removed. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'External decontamination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that patients who ingest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonidine</a> tablets or related imidazoline preparations and who present within the one hour of known or suspected clonidine ingestion receive activated charcoal (AC) (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg,</span> maximum dose 50 g) by mouth or nasogastric tube (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Charcoal should be withheld in patients who are sedated and may not be able to protect their airway, unless endotracheal intubation is performed first. However, endotracheal intubation should not be performed solely for the purpose of giving charcoal. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Gastrointestinal decontamination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because the likelihood of preventing medication absorption is low and is outweighed by the risk of pulmonary aspiration, we suggest that patients who seek care more than two hours after known or suspected <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonidine</a> tablet or related imidazoline preparation ingestion <strong>not</strong> receive AC. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Gastrointestinal decontamination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that patients who ingest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonidine</a> transdermal patches and who present within the first hour receive a single oral dose of AC (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). In this setting, AC may also prevent delayed absorption of clonidine when administered more than one hour after ingestion. We suggest that AC be followed by nasogastric whole bowel irrigation with polyethylene glycol&nbsp;(<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Endotracheal intubation may be necessary in symptomatic patients to avoid aspiration. In addition, gastrointestinal integrity must be assured before initiation of whole bowel irrigation. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Gastrointestinal decontamination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend <strong>not</strong> emptying the stomach by gastric lavage or syrup of ipecac induced emesis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Gastrointestinal decontamination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that patients poisoned with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonidine</a> or related imidazolines with marked CNS depression and apnea receive intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naloxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naloxone</a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). This treatment should not delay the timely provision of aggressive supportive care in patients who do not respond. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Specific treatment measures and antidotal therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We admit the following patients with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonidine</a> or related imidazoline ingestion:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>All symptomatic patients</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>All patients who ingest transdermal patches</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who are suicidal warrant psychiatric evaluation prior to discharge and should also be carefully evaluated for coingestions, including the measurement of an <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> level</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who are asymptomatic for six hours after ingestion of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clonidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clonidine</a> or related imidazoline tablets or liquid, and who are not suicidal, may be discharged home as long as close observation and the ability to return rapidly if care is needed are assured.
