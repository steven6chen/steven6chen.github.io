Nonimmune hydrops fetalis (NIHF) comprises the subgroup of cases not caused by red cell alloimmunization (eg, Rh(D), Kell).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of NIHF ranges from <span class=\"nowrap\">1/1500</span> to <span class=\"nowrap\">1/4000</span> births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonimmune-hydrops-fetalis/abstract/1-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-6</a>]. Wide variations in reported prevalence are due to differences in definitions, populations, thoroughness of evaluation, and whether late pregnancy terminations were included.</p><p>The widespread use of Rh(D) <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> has dramatically decreased the prevalence of Rh(D) alloimmunization and associated hydrops. As a result, NIHF now accounts for almost 90 percent of hydrops cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonimmune-hydrops-fetalis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of NIHF is incompletely understood. Fluid homeostasis within the vascular and interstitial compartments is controlled by both hydrostatic and osmotic pressures as demonstrated by the Starling equation. Cellular mechanisms also regulate fluid movement and contribute to the Starling forces. Dysregulation of the net fluid movement between the vascular and interstitial spaces leading to NIHF can be caused by fetal disorders with one or more of the following features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonimmune-hydrops-fetalis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Obstructed lymphatic drainage in the thoracic and abdominal cavities </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased capillary permeability </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased central venous pressure </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased osmotic pressure </p><p/><p>Further investigation is needed to understand the complex interplay between fetal myocardial function, maintenance of intravascular volume, and neural and circulating plasma proteins and hormones, and to explain how each factor contributes to hydrops.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H600837149\"><span class=\"h2\">Presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>NIHF may be discovered incidentally during prenatal sonography performed for standard obstetric indications, during a work-up for decreased fetal activity or abnormal antepartum fetal test results, during a work-up for uterine size greater than dates, or during monitoring of fetuses with, or at risk for, disorders associated with hydrops.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H600830836\"><span class=\"h2\">Fetal findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>NIHF is defined by fetal findings. Two or more of the following findings should be present on ultrasound examination:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ascites</strong> &ndash; In its early stage, fetal ascites appears as a rim of echolucent fluid just inside the abdominal wall (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F62798\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef62798 \">image 1</a>) or surrounding the bladder or liver. Pseudoascites, which is a hypoechoic band comprised of abdominal wall muscles, should not be mistaken for ascites. If there is a large amount of ascites, the bowel may appear compressed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F56150\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef56150 \">image 2</a>) and its walls may be accentuated due to increased ultrasound transmission afforded by the excess intraabdominal fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonimmune-hydrops-fetalis/abstract/4,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Isolated fetal ascites can result from several disorders and is not considered true hydrops since only one compartment is affected, but may progress to hydrops. (See <a href=\"#H600831290\" class=\"local\">'General approach'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pleural effusions</strong> &ndash; Pleural effusions appear as a rim of echolucent fluid just inside the chest wall, outlining the lungs. The effusion may be unilateral or bilateral, and may compress the lung tissue (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F54321%7EOBGYN%2F70095%7EOBGYN%2F100755\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef54321 graphicRef70095 graphicRef100755 \">image 3A-C</a>). Persistent effusions that develop before 20 weeks of gestation may retard the growth and development of the lungs, leading to pulmonary hypoplasia, which may be fatal in the neonatal period. A variety of techniques for prenatal diagnosis of severe pulmonary hypoplasia have been reported, but none are consistently reliable. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pericardial effusions</strong> &ndash; Pericardial effusions appear as a rim of echolucent fluid surrounding the heart (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F53761\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef53761 \">image 4</a>), but may be difficult to visualize with standard two-dimensional images. It is important not to mistake physiologic pericardial fluid or the hypoechoic myocardium for an abnormal effusion. Use of M-mode helps in measuring pericardial effusions accurately and differentiating between physiologic and pathologic pericardial fluid when the diagnosis is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonimmune-hydrops-fetalis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. During second-trimester fetal ultrasonographic examination, visualization of pericardial fluid up to 2 mm thick is common and should not be regarded as pathologic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonimmune-hydrops-fetalis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], and even fluid up to 7 mm thick may be benign [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonimmune-hydrops-fetalis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Pericardial fluid greater than 2 mm thick that increases on serial examinations suggests a pathologic etiology. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Skin edema</strong> &ndash; Skin edema is a late sign of fetal hydrops (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F61425\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef61425 \">image 5</a>). Pathologic skin edema has been defined as subcutaneous tissue thickness on the chest or scalp greater than 5 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonimmune-hydrops-fetalis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Fat under the scalp or in the posterior nuchal region should not be mistaken for skin edema.</p><p/><p>NIHF may be associated with polyhydramnios and placental thickening. Polyhydramnios is generally defined as an amniotic fluid index greater than 24 cm or a maximum vertical pocket greater than 8 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonimmune-hydrops-fetalis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. It is present in up to 75 percent of pregnancies complicated by NIHF. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polyhydramnios\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Polyhydramnios&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The placenta may appear thickened due to intravillous edema (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F62303\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef62303 \">image 6</a>). In general, a placental thickness &ge;4 cm in the second trimester and &ge;6 cm in the third trimester is considered abnormal and should prompt further investigation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonimmune-hydrops-fetalis/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. However, massive polyhydramnios can cause the placenta to appear thinned or compressed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H600830844\"><span class=\"h2\">Maternal findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women carrying a hydropic fetus may have uterine size large for dates and may notice decreased fetal movement. Although hydrops is a fetal condition, in many cases there are associated maternal findings, such as theca lutein cysts, preeclampsia, anemia, or preterm labor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Mirror syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mirror syndrome (also called Ballantynes syndrome) refers to a condition of generalized maternal edema, often with pulmonary involvement, that 'mirrors' the edema of the hydropic fetus and placenta. Although usually associated with NIHF, it can also occur with immune-mediated hydrops. The pathogenesis is unknown. One hypothesis is that the hydropic placenta causes a systemic inflammatory response as a result of increased shedding of trophoblastic debris into maternal blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonimmune-hydrops-fetalis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Others have postulated that the hydropic placenta may increase production of soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase (sFlt1), which is an important mediator of maternal endothelial and vascular abnormalities in preeclampsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonimmune-hydrops-fetalis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preeclampsia-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preeclampsia: Pathogenesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Mirror syndrome can occur any time during the antepartum period and may persist postpartum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonimmune-hydrops-fetalis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. It may present with rapid weight gain, increasing peripheral edema, and progressive shortness of breath, or with a clinical presentation and course similar to that of preeclampsia with severe features. In contrast to preeclampsia, the maternal hematocrit is often low (hemodilution) rather than high (hemoconcentration), amniotic fluid volume is often high (polyhydramnios) rather than low (oligohydramnios), and the fetus always shows signs of hydrops [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonimmune-hydrops-fetalis/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. A systematic review of reports on mirror syndrome noted that key maternal signs were edema (80 to 100 percent), hypertension (57 to 78 percent) and proteinuria (20 to 56 percent), and the overall rate of intrauterine death was 56 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonimmune-hydrops-fetalis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Severe maternal complications, such as pulmonary edema, occurred in 21 percent of cases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polyhydramnios\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Polyhydramnios&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preeclampsia-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preeclampsia: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Delivery is usually required to induce remission of maternal symptoms. In the review described above, maternal symptoms disappeared 4.8 to 13.5 days after delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonimmune-hydrops-fetalis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Interventions that result in reversal of fetal hydrops, including selective feticide of a hydropic twin, can also reverse the maternal disorder, thereby allowing prolongation of the pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonimmune-hydrops-fetalis/abstract/18,20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,20-23</a>]. Spontaneous resolution of mirror syndrome has also been described after spontaneous resolution of fetal hydrops related to parvovirus infection and after fetal death. </p><p>However, prompt delivery is indicated, even in NIHF with a treatable etiology, because women with severe features of preeclampsia can deteriorate rapidly. These decisions should be made on a case-by-case basis taking into account the severity of the maternal condition, the severity of the fetal condition, and the potential for rapid resolution of fetal hydrops.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H600834651\"><span class=\"h2\">Course of pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Spontaneous or indicated preterm birth is common, occurring in 66 percent of pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonimmune-hydrops-fetalis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Severe polyhydramnios may lead to maternal respiratory symptoms, which may require treatment or necessitate delivery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polyhydramnios#H2287303357\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Polyhydramnios&quot;, section on 'Management of pregnancies with polyhydramnios'</a>.)</p><p>After delivery, these pregnancies are at increased risk for retained placenta and postpartum hemorrhage. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prenatal diagnosis of hydrops fetalis is based on ultrasound examination that shows two or more of the following fetal findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ascites</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pleural effusion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pericardial effusion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin edema (&gt;5 mm)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H600831234\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTDIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An attempt to determine the etiology of the hydrops should be made at the time of diagnosis, since several etiologies can be confirmed or excluded based upon ultrasound findings. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Disorders associated with hydrops and antepartum management'</a> below.)</p><p>The cause of hydrops can be determined prenatally or postnatally in 60 to 85 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonimmune-hydrops-fetalis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H600831290\"><span class=\"h2\">General approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hydrops is associated with a broad spectrum of diseases. Prenatally, the key issues are to (1) identify those cases caused by disorders that are treatable in utero and (2) deliver the fetus when the benefits of prolonging pregnancy are outweighed by the risk of fetal demise. Prenatally or postnatally, it is important to identify disorders with a risk of recurrence in future pregnancies.</p><p>We perform a thorough sonogram of the fetus, placenta, umbilical cord, and amniotic fluid to look for causes of NIHF that can be diagnosed by imaging, such as major fetal or placental structural abnormalities, arrhythmias, and twin-twin transfusion syndrome. A fetal echocardiogram should be performed as it may detect previously unrecognized cardiac abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonimmune-hydrops-fetalis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fetal-cardiac-abnormalities-screening-evaluation-and-pregnancy-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fetal cardiac abnormalities: Screening, evaluation, and pregnancy management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-general-approach-to-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-fetal-arrhythmias\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the general approach to diagnosis and treatment of fetal arrhythmias&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If the fetal survey does not reveal the cause of hydrops, we perform Doppler assessment of the fetal middle cerebral artery peak systolic velocity to evaluate for fetal anemia (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-pregnancy-complicated-by-rhesus-d-alloimmunization#H321054809\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of pregnancy complicated by Rhesus (D) alloimmunization&quot;, section on 'Assess for severe anemia in fetuses at risk'</a>). This procedure has emerged as an accurate noninvasive tool for predicting fetal anemia of any etiology (ie, immune or nonimmune) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonimmune-hydrops-fetalis/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. If elevated (above 1.5 multiples of the median for the gestational age), we try to determine the cause of the anemia (eg, parvovirus infection, alloimmunization, fetomaternal bleeding, hemoglobinopathy). (See <a href=\"#H937252930\" class=\"local\">'Anemia'</a> below.)</p><p>If the cause for NIHF is not identified on ultrasound and Doppler examination, we obtain a detailed family history and laboratory studies. A genetic counselor can be helpful in obtaining a thorough history. The patient's ethnic background and personal and family history are reviewed to look for heritable disorders associated with hydrops, such as alpha-thalassemia, metabolic disorders, and genetic syndromes. We ask about consanguinity, which increases the probability of recessive disorders. We also ask about recent exposure to individuals, particularly children, with an infection. Parvovirus B19 is the most common infectious etiology of hydrops, accounting for about 15 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonimmune-hydrops-fetalis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=parvovirus-b19-infection-during-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Parvovirus B19 infection during pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>We perform the following laboratory evaluation. The sequence is determined by the most likely diagnoses in a specific patient, cost, and invasiveness. Some tests are performed simultaneously, as the results of individual tests may not be available for several days to weeks, thus precluding sequential studies. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete blood count with red blood cell indices. A mean corpuscular volume (MCV) &lt;80 femtoliters (fL) in the absence of iron deficiency suggests thalassemia. The father&rsquo;s MCV should be determined. If both parents have MCV &lt;80 fL, additional studies are required. Hemoglobin electrophoresis will identify carriers of hemoglobin variants and beta-thalassemia. In Asian couples, however, DNA-based genotyping is generally necessary to rule out alpha-thalassemia (hemoglobin electrophoresis is not recommended because it is nondiagnostic of alpha-thalassemia). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-thalassemias\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of the thalassemias&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-screening-and-testing-for-hemoglobinopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prenatal screening and testing for hemoglobinopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood type and antibody screen.

The sample can be obtained by amniocentesis, chorionic villus (placental) biopsy, or fetal blood sampling (see individual topic reviews on these procedures). Prenatal diagnosis of chromosomal disorders can be performed initially with a conventional G-banded karyotype. Chromosomal microarray is obtained if the conventional karyotype is normal because microarray detects submicroscopic deletions and duplications that may be associated with hydrops but are missed by conventional karyotyping [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonimmune-hydrops-fetalis/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. Alternatively, it may be cost-effective to perform chromosomal microarray as the initial genetic test. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maternal immunoglobulin M (IgM) and immunoglobulin G (IgG) serologies are obtained for the most common infectious causes of NIHF: parvovirus B19, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and toxoplasmosis. Parvovirus B19 is the most common of these and causes fetal anemia and myocardial dysfunction (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=parvovirus-b19-infection-during-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Parvovirus B19 infection during pregnancy&quot;</a>). The typical sonographic finding of fetal CMV infection is bilateral periventricular hyperechogenicities (calcifications) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F54305\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef54305 \">image 7</a>) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytomegalovirus-infection-in-pregnancy#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cytomegalovirus infection in pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Prenatal (fetal) diagnosis'</a>). Intracranial hyperechogenic foci or calcifications and ventricular dilatation are the most common findings of fetal toxoplasmosis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=toxoplasmosis-and-pregnancy#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Toxoplasmosis and pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Fetal infection'</a>). Hydrops is a characteristic finding of congenital syphilis; therefore, a nontreponemal antibody test (eg, Venereal Disease Research Laboratory [VDRL] test, Rapid Plasma Reagin [RPR] test) should be obtained if not recently performed as part of routine prenatal care. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syphilis-in-pregnancy#H3239120125\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syphilis in pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Newborn evaluation and treatment'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In asymptomatic women, there is a low yield from serology for rubella, varicella, adenovirus, coxsackie virus, and other less common infectious agents. We obtain these tests if the patient&rsquo;s history, physical examination, or ultrasound findings suggest one of these infections. We also may obtain them as a last resort if no etiology for NIHF has been determined by other testing. We do not obtain serology for herpes simplex virus (HSV) unless the patient has a history of primary genital HSV prior to onset of NIHF. In these cases, we prefer to send polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of amniotic fluid and correlate with maternal serology. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If amniotic fluid is obtained for genetic testing and an infectious etiology for NIHF has not been excluded, the fluid is sent for PCR for CMV, parvovirus B19, and toxoplasmosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonimmune-hydrops-fetalis/abstract/1,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,33</a>]. An additional 10 mL of fluid is needed for the PCR studies. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Amniotic fluid should also be frozen and stored in order to test for rare lysosomal storage diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonimmune-hydrops-fetalis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>] in the at-risk patient (consanguinity, previous family history, Ashkenazi Jewish or French Canadian descent) or after other investigations have been nondiagnostic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonimmune-hydrops-fetalis/abstract/8,35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,35,36</a>]. Alternatively, cells can be cultured, frozen, and stored in case additional studies are required.</p><p/><p>Isolated fetal ascites can result from several disorders, including urinary, gastrointestinal, lymphatic, cardiac, or pulmonary abnormalities; infection; storage diseases; neoplasia; and aneuploidy or genetic syndromes. These cases are not considered true hydrops since only one compartment is affected, but may progress to hydrops. If the diagnostic evaluation described above does not reveal the cause, a sample of aspirated ascitic fluid can be analyzed for cell count and cytology, cytoplasmic vacuoles in lymphocytes, total protein, &beta;2-microglobulin, total IgM, gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase, aspartate aminotransferase, aminopeptidase M, and total alkaline phosphatase. One study reported lymphocytes accounted for over 80 percent of the cell population in cases of chylous ascites, vacuolated cells were observed in 100 percent cases of storage diseases, low protein levels (&lt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/L)</span> were observed in 75 percent of cases of urinary and genitourinary origin, high digestive enzymes levels were observed in 100 percent of cases of digestive origin, and high &beta;2-microglobulin values (&gt;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/L)</span> were observed in 100 percent of infectious cases; however, there were &le;10 cases in each of these categories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonimmune-hydrops-fetalis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

Fetal tachyarrhythmias can often be treated by maternal administration of rate controlling agents; however, in cases of hydrops, disturbances in the placental transfer may render maternal therapy inadequate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonimmune-hydrops-fetalis/abstract/43,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,45</a>].

Complex congenital lesions that affect the AV nodal region result in anatomic interruptions in the conduction system leading to atrioventricular dissociation and bradycardia. The other one-half of persistent bradyarrhythmias are related to maternal autoimmune disorders in which maternal immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies cross the placenta and cause direct damage to fetal bundle of His and Purkinje fibers.

The most common aneuploidy associated with NIHF is monosomy X (Turner syndrome), which accounts for 42 to 67 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonimmune-hydrops-fetalis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Other aneuploidies associated with hydrops include trisomy 21 (23 to 30 percent of cases); trisomy 13, 18, and 12 (10 percent of cases); tetraploidy; triploidy; and, rarely, deletions and duplications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonimmune-hydrops-fetalis/abstract/40,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,46</a>]. The mechanism for fluid accumulation in these fetuses may involve obstruction or incomplete formation of the lymphatic system in the neck or abdomen, leading to lymphatic dysplasia. Other mechanisms include cardiac failure related to congenital heart disease (present in 15 to 25 percent of aneuploid fetuses) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonimmune-hydrops-fetalis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>] and transient abnormal myelopoiesis, a congenital leukemia associated with Down syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonimmune-hydrops-fetalis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. The prognosis is poor, with a mortality rate approaching 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonimmune-hydrops-fetalis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

In non-lethal aneuploidies, fetal and maternal surveillance for signs of decompensation and possible early delivery are warranted. (See <a href=\"#H600834741\" class=\"local\">'Pregnancy and delivery management'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H937252930\"><span class=\"h2\">Anemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Severe fetal anemia accounts for 10 to 27 percent of hydrops [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonimmune-hydrops-fetalis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. It may be due to a variety of causes, including hemorrhage, hemolysis, defective red cell production, and production of abnormal hemoglobins. Specific conditions associated with fetal anemia are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F62279\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62279 \">table 3</a>). The mechanism for hydrops is thought to be high output cardiac failure. </p><p>Hydrops is observed when the fetal hemoglobin is less than half the median value for gestational age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonimmune-hydrops-fetalis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In general terms, fetal anemia is most likely to result in hydrops when the hemoglobin concentration is &le;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL,</span> which approximates a hematocrit less than 30 percent. A presumptive diagnosis of fetal anemia is made by Doppler assessment of the fetal middle cerebral artery (MCA) peak systolic velocity (PSV) &ge;1.5 multiples of the median (sensitivity and specificity for severe anemia 75.5 and 90.8 percent, respectively), and can be confirmed by cordocentesis. Whether to perform cordocentesis, follow MCA-PSV serially, transfuse in utero, or deliver the fetus depends on the gestational age and cause of anemia.</p><p>Alloimmunization as a cause of fetal anemia is excluded by negative results on maternal screening for antibodies directed against red cell antigens. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-rhesus-d-alloimmunization-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of Rhesus D alloimmunization in pregnancy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-non-rhesus-d-red-blood-cell-alloantibodies-during-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of non-Rhesus (D) red blood cell alloantibodies during pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Alpha-thalassemia major is the most common cause of NIHF among southeast Asians. It is an autosomal recessive condition characterized by a mutation or deletion of the hemoglobin alpha gene. Because there is no alpha globin chain production, affected fetuses cannot synthesize a functional hemoglobin molecule. Gamma chains accumulate and form gamma-4 tetramers (hemoglobin Bart's); hemoglobin Bart's binds oxygen, but cannot release it to tissues because its affinity for oxygen is much greater than that of hemoglobin A. Hemoglobin electrophoresis will show greater than 80 percent hemoglobin Barts while the remaining hemoglobin will be of embryonic origin, with a small component of hemoglobin H (beta-4 tetramers) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonimmune-hydrops-fetalis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The fetus may be severely anemic, and a peripheral slide will show nucleated red cells and target cells. Profound acidosis, hypoxia and hydrops develop early in the midtrimester, followed by intrauterine fetal demise unless the fetus is serially transfused (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-alpha-thalassemia#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of alpha thalassemia&quot;, section on 'Hydrops fetalis and hemoglobin Bart's'</a>). Parental mean corpuscular volume &lt;80 femtoliters (fL) in the absence of iron deficiency suggests alpha or beta thalassemia minor and further testing with hemoglobin analysis is indicated to establish a diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-screening-and-testing-for-hemoglobinopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prenatal screening and testing for hemoglobinopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Some fetal anemias are transient; anemia associated with parvovirus infection is an example. The laboratory diagnosis of maternal parvovirus B19 infection relies primarily on IgG and IgM antibody testing to determine pre-existing immunity, acute infection, or susceptibility. Polymerase chain reaction testing on amniotic fluid is the method of choice to make the fetal diagnosis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=parvovirus-b19-infection-during-pregnancy#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Parvovirus B19 infection during pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Fetal hydrops'</a>). In these cases, hydrops may resolve spontaneously; however, when severe anemia persists, intrauterine transfusion is a potentially life-saving option. Platelets should be available at the time of blood sampling and transfusion since some fetuses may also be profoundly thrombocytopenic. Aggressive therapy and surveillance are warranted, as the prognosis is generally good. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intrauterine-fetal-transfusion-of-red-cells\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intrauterine fetal transfusion of red cells&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Anemia secondary to massive fetomaternal transfusion is diagnosed by Kleihauer-Betke smear or flow cytometry.

Since these processes are self-limited, the prognosis is generally good if the fetus is supported by intrauterine fetal transfusions until the disease remits. Platelet concentrates should also be available since some fetuses may also be profoundly thrombocytopenic. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=parvovirus-b19-infection-during-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Parvovirus B19 infection during pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In contrast, the development of hydrops in fetuses with most other infections reflects multisystem failure (eg, myocarditis leading to heart failure, liver involvement leading to hypoalbuminemia) and is a poor prognostic sign. Therapy, if available, is directed toward the infectious agents.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H937253698\"><span class=\"h2\">Thoracic and lymphatic abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thoracic abnormalities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F66844\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66844 \">table 5</a>) account for up to 10 percent of hydrops. These lesions increase intrathoracic pressure and can obstruct venous return to the heart, leading to peripheral venous congestion, or they may obstruct the lymphatic duct, resulting in lymphedema. Interference with fluid exchange between the lung and amniotic cavity may contribute to polyhydramnios. </p><p>Fetal pleural effusions may be isolated or associated with hydrops, which confers a worse prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonimmune-hydrops-fetalis/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>]. They can be related to aneuploidy (such as trisomy 21 or Turner syndrome), structural malformations or tumors (eg, involving the heart, lungs, lymphatic system), congenital infection (eg, CMV, parvovirus, toxoplasmosis), and genetic syndromes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonimmune-hydrops-fetalis/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. The most common thoracic masses associated with NIHF are congenital pulmonary malformation and bronchopulmonary sequestration (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-pulmonary-airway-cystic-adenomatoid-malformation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital pulmonary airway (cystic adenomatoid) malformation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bronchopulmonary-sequestration\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bronchopulmonary sequestration&quot;</a>). Genetic syndromes associated with NIHF include Opitz-Frias hypertelorism hypospadias syndrome, Familial Nuchal Bleb, Noonan's syndrome, acrocephalopolydactylous dysplasia (also known as Elejalde syndrome), thoracoabdominal syndrome, lymphedema distichiasis syndrome, multiple pterygium syndrome, arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, congenital myotonic dystrophy, Pena Shokeir and Neu Laxova syndromes, and yellow nail syndrome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F70066\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70066 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonimmune-hydrops-fetalis/abstract/54-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">54-57</a>]. </p><p>Primary congenital pulmonary lymphangiectasis results from thoracic duct obstruction, while secondary congenital pulmonary lymphangiectasis is a consequence of thoracic masses or congenital heart defects or a component of a discrete syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonimmune-hydrops-fetalis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Primary congenital pulmonary lymphangiectasis leads to hydrops by reducing venous return or cardiac tamponade and may be treated by pleuroamniotic shunting at midgestation to prevent pulmonary hypoplasia. Generalized lymphangiectasis syndrome results from systemic lymphatic vessel ectasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonimmune-hydrops-fetalis/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. In this condition, subcutaneous and visceral lymphedema occurs concomitantly with chylothorax. Hydrops results from gastrointestinal protein loss, chylothorax, and diffuse lymphatic leak. </p><p>The overall prognosis depends, in part, upon the gestational age at the time pulmonary abnormalities developed. Persistent pleural effusions before 20 weeks of gestation can compromise lung growth and function, and thus are a poor prognostic sign. The degree of pulmonary hypoplasia cannot be reliably determined sonographically. </p><p>Needle aspiration of pleural effusions is not recommended, except as a prelude to shunting, because the fluid usually reaccumulates within 48 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonimmune-hydrops-fetalis/abstract/5,60\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,60</a>]. If pleural fluid is obtained, the diagnosis of chylothorax is confirmed by a fetal pleural cell count with &gt;80 percent lymphocytes in the absence of infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonimmune-hydrops-fetalis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>In fetuses with large pleural effusions (eg, hydrothorax, chylothorax), placement of a pleuroamniotic shunt may alleviate the increased intrathoracic pressure, thereby reducing the risk of pulmonary hypoplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonimmune-hydrops-fetalis/abstract/8,51,61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,51,61,62</a>]. It may also reduce venous and lymphatic obstruction and allow hydrops to resolve. This approach is supported by systematic reviews that found the survival rate for fetuses with pleural effusion and hydrops who were shunted was significantly higher than for those who underwent expectant management (over 60 percent versus less than 25 percent survival, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonimmune-hydrops-fetalis/abstract/60,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,63</a>].

In one study, the overall incidence of lysosomal storage disease (LSD) was 5.2 percent of all NIHF cases tested for any LSD, 17.4 percent in idiopathic NIHF cases, and 24.6 percent of idiopathic NIH cases where a comprehensive LSD workup was done [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonimmune-hydrops-fetalis/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].&nbsp;The three most common LSDs were mucopolysaccharidosis type VII, Gaucher's disease, and GM1-gangliosidosis.</p><p>These rare genetic disorders are due to lack of specific enzymes necessary to process various metabolites within the lysosome in organs such as the brain, heart, liver, and kidneys. The pathogenesis of hydrops is likely related to congestion of abdominal viscera from accumulation of these metabolites, leading to hepatitis and other organ damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonimmune-hydrops-fetalis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. This process then leads to increased hydrostatic pressure, decreased oncotic pressure, and possibly cardiomyopathy and cardiac dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonimmune-hydrops-fetalis/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Decreased erythropoiesis resulting in anemia may also play a role.</p><p>Panels for testing for some causative storage disorders are available in some laboratories. An attempt at prenatal diagnosis is an option with cases of recurrence within a family or when NIFH occurs in a structurally normal fetus and no cause has been identified after a standard work-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonimmune-hydrops-fetalis/abstract/26,66,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,66,68</a>]. </p><p>There is no specific therapy in the antenatal period; in utero death usually occurs. It is important to make an accurate diagnosis postnatally and offer genetic counseling, as the risk of recurrence in a future pregnancy is as high as 1 in 4.

The mechanism may involve altered venous return, cardiac tamponade, or hepatic dysfunction with hypoproteinemia. Prenatal diagnosis is based on recognition of skeletal abnormalities.

Among live born infants, mortality was 43 percent at one year of age in one large series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonimmune-hydrops-fetalis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Despite advances in fetal diagnosis and therapy, the mortality rate has not changed substantially over the past 15 years.</p><p>Prognosis depends upon the etiology, the gestational age at onset, the gestational age at delivery, and whether pleural effusions are present. In general, the earlier hydrops occurs, the poorer the prognosis. In particular, pleural effusions and polyhydramnios prior to 20 weeks of gestation are poor prognostic signs because of increased risks of pulmonary hypoplasia and preterm premature rupture of <span class=\"nowrap\">membranes/preterm</span> delivery, respectively. On the other hand, absence of aneuploidy and absence of major structural abnormalities confer a better prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonimmune-hydrops-fetalis/abstract/33,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,72</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H600834741\"><span class=\"h1\">PREGNANCY AND DELIVERY MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pregnancy counseling and management are guided by the etiology and severity of NIHF and whether it can be treated successfully. Conditions amenable to fetal therapy often require urgent treatment, which may necessitate referral to a specialized center; pregnancy termination is also an option. Counseling should include a discussion of the potential risks and benefits of the available interventions versus expectant management, taking into account the severity of the underlying condition and the anticipated response to the intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonimmune-hydrops-fetalis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. For cases with a lethal prognosis, pregnancy termination or comfort care are options. For cases in which the etiology is not known and the prognosis is uncertain, options include antepartum monitoring with active intervention if there is fetal deterioration versus comfort care and support. Pregnancy termination is also an option. Antenatal consultations with relevant subspecialty services (eg, neonatology) should be obtained and may help to guide decisions about the appropriate extent of fetal monitoring and intervention. Delivery of potentially viable neonates should occur at a tertiary care center, with coordination of the obstetrical, maternal-fetal medicine, neonatal, and pediatric subspecialty teams. </p><p>Continuing pregnancies should be monitored closely for development of mirror syndrome; prompt delivery is usually indicated if it develops. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Mirror syndrome'</a> above.) </p><p>In the absence of a lethal etiology of NIHF, antenatal surveillance is generally performed because of the high risk of fetal death and the possibility that early delivery will be beneficial. We perform non-stress testing or biophysical profile testing at least weekly, with delivery if there is evidence of fetal decompensation at a viable gestational age. We perform Doppler assessment of the umbilical vein as development of umbilical venous pulsations in hydropic fetuses is an ominous finding associated with demise in over 70 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonimmune-hydrops-fetalis/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>] &#160; Serial Doppler velocimetry of the middle cerebral artery is not useful in the absence of suspected fetal anemia and Doppler velocimetry of the umbilical artery is not useful in the absence of fetal growth restriction.</p><p>Antepartum corticosteroid therapy is indicated if the gestational age is between 24 and 34 weeks, the underlying etiology of the hydrops is not believed to be lethal, and if intervention is planned should deterioration of the fetal condition occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonimmune-hydrops-fetalis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. </p><p>Elective preterm delivery &lt;34 weeks is a poor prognostic factor and should be avoided in the absence of deterioration in maternal or fetal status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonimmune-hydrops-fetalis/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. Based on expert opinion, new onset or worsening of NIHF in a pregnancy that has reached 34 weeks is a reasonable indication for delivery, although care should be individualized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonimmune-hydrops-fetalis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. However, in the absence of clinical deterioration or other indication for earlier intervention, we suggest delivery at 37 to 38 weeks.</p><p>Vaginal delivery is preferred if neonatal intervention will be withheld because of the poor prognosis. Cesarean birth is performed for routine obstetrical indications; however, it is commonly required because delivery is often prompted by a deterioration in the fetal condition antepartum and because of the high frequency of category ll and lll fetal heart rate patterns intrapartum. Dystocia during delivery is also a concern, and increases the risk of birth trauma regardless of mode of delivery. Ultrasound guided percutaneous in utero needle aspiration of a large collection of pleural fluid <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ascites prior to delivery may reduce the risk of dystocia and facilitate neonatal resuscitation. </p><p>Congenital cardiac and thoracic abnormalities that result in NIHF very commonly result in rapid declines in pulmonary <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cardiac function in the neonatal period that require immediate intervention. Depending on the etiology of NIHF, specific interventions to support the neonate may be indicated at delivery. For example, a fetus with a large pulmonary lesion, mediastinal shift, and hydrops may benefit from ex-utero intrapartum therapy (EXIT) performed at cesarean delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonimmune-hydrops-fetalis/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. In EXIT, the fetus is partially delivered and intubated without clamping the umbilical cord. Uteroplacental blood flow and gas exchange are maintained by using inhalational agents to provide uterine relaxation and amnioinfusion to maintain uterine volume. This provides a multidisciplinary team sufficient time to initiate extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (EXIT to ECMO) to stabilize the neonate, thus allowing for a more controlled surgery by the pediatric surgical teams at a later time and place. However, the benefit of this approach is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonimmune-hydrops-fetalis/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H566341828\"><span class=\"h1\">STILLBORNS AND NEONATES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We recommend autopsy in all cases of fetal or neonatal death or pregnancy termination associated with NIHF. Consultation with a medical geneticist is also advisable. Storage of amniotic fluid <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fetal cells has been suggested for future genetic testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonimmune-hydrops-fetalis/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. </p><p>Management of the neonate is reviewed separately.

If hydrops was related to an anatomical variant (eg, congenital heart disease), the recurrence risk is minimal when the anatomic variant is not identified in the subsequent pregnancy. Hydrops related to a specific viral exposure (eg, parvovirus B19) should not recur because the mother will have developed immunity. In contrast, the risk of recurrent NIHF can be high when hydrops has a genetic basis.</p><p>As noted above, the clinician cannot always determine the etiology of fetal hydrops. Genetics consultation can be useful in these cases as the quality of information from genetic testing continues to evolve. In cases where no cause is found, the likelihood of recurrent hydrops is low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonimmune-hydrops-fetalis/abstract/78-80\" class=\"abstract_t\">78-80</a>]. Since the risk of recurrence is not zero, a midtrimester sonogram in subsequent gestations is reasonable. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hydrops fetalis refers to abnormal fluid collections in fetal soft tissues and serous cavities. Nonimmune hydrops fetalis (NIHF) comprises the subgroup of cases not caused by red cell alloimmunization (eg, Rh(D), Kell). (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women carrying a hydropic fetus may have uterine size large for dates and may notice decreased fetal movement. Although hydrops is a fetal condition, in many cases there are associated maternal findings, such as generalized edema with or without preeclampsia (ie, mirror syndrome). (See <a href=\"#H600830844\" class=\"local\">'Maternal findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of hydrops is based on the presence of two or more of the following findings on ultrasound examination: skin edema, pleural effusion, pericardial effusion, ascites. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An attempt to determine the etiology of hydrops should be made at the time of diagnosis, since several etiologies can be confirmed or excluded based upon ultrasound findings. The cause of hydrops can be determined prenatally or postnatally in 60 to 85 percent of cases. (See <a href=\"#H600831234\" class=\"local\">'Postdiagnostic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hydrops is associated with a broad spectrum of diseases. Prenatally, the key issues are to (1) identify those cases caused by disorders that are treatable in utero and (2) deliver the fetus when the benefits of prolonging pregnancy are outweighed by the risk of fetal demise. Prenatally or postnatally, it is important to identify disorders with a risk of recurrence in future pregnancies. Our approach to prenatal diagnosis is illustrated in the algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F100483\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef100483 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H600831290\" class=\"local\">'General approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The causes of nonimmune hydrops are heterogeneous and include aneuploidy, structural abnormalities, metabolic disorders, anemia, and infection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F70066\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70066 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Disorders associated with hydrops and antepartum management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of hydrops is a poor prognostic indicator for perinatal survival (see <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above). Management and intervention are dictated by the underlying disease process and the gestational age at detection. Fetal anemia, fetal arrhythmias, and complications of monochorionic twin pregnancy are amenable to in utero intervention. (See <a href=\"#H937252008\" class=\"local\">'Arrhythmias'</a> above and <a href=\"#H937252930\" class=\"local\">'Anemia'</a> above and <a href=\"#H937254130\" class=\"local\">'Twin gestation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maternal-fetal medicine specialists and neonatologists should be involved in the management of these pregnancies.
