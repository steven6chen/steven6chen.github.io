Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis is characterized by fungal invasion into the lung parenchyma with pneumonia, with or without dissemination to other organ systems, including the central nervous system, heart, kidney, and sinuses. The majority of patients present with fever, dyspnea and cough [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-invasive-pulmonary-aspergillosis-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. A wide spectrum of radiographic changes can be seen, including cavitary lesions, focal alveolar infiltrates, or diffuse interstitial infiltrates.

However, only a small percentage of patients will develop invasive disease, as demonstrated on histopathology. </p><p>The probability that the isolation of <em>Aspergillus</em> species represents a true pathogen is a function of the host&rsquo;s risk factors for disease and whether the patient has a compatible clinical presentation. Host risk factors for the development of invasive disease include a CD4 cell count of &lt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/mm<sup>3</sup>,</span> neutropenia, or recent use of corticosteroids. Other risk factors for invasive infection include a history of underlying lung disease or opportunistic infections.

A classification system was formed to designate disease as either &quot;proven,&quot; &quot;probable,&quot; or &quot;possible&quot; invasive aspergillosis. These classifications are defined as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A &quot;proven&quot; diagnosis requires the demonstration of hyphal elements with evidence of associated tissue damage or culture of <em>Aspergillus</em> from a specimen obtained by a sterile procedure from a normally sterile site (such as the lung or skin) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-invasive-pulmonary-aspergillosis-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Probable&quot; disease occurs if the patient has a clinical syndrome consistent with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis and the organism is detected via culture or through the use of biomarkers (eg, Beta-D-glucan, galactomannan).

The utility of these guidelines in HIV-infected patients is unclear since the sensitivity and specificity of molecular diagnostic assays in HIV-infected patients with aspergillosis has not been established (see below). In addition, invasive aspergillosis in HIV-infected patients may occur without classical predisposing host factors (eg, prolonged neutropenia). As an example, in a study evaluating the use of EORTC criteria for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in 242 HIV-infected patients in a French cohort, only 124 (51 percent) fulfilled EORTC criteria for invasive aspergillosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-invasive-pulmonary-aspergillosis-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9541246\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC ASSAYS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Assays commonly employed for the diagnosis of aspergillosis in the immunocompromised host include culture, histology, and antigen detection methods. However, in contrast to patients with a history of hematologic malignancy or transplantation, antigen detection methods (eg, galactomannan and beta-D-glucan) have not been thoroughly studied in HIV patients with invasive aspergillosis; thus, the role of these molecular diagnostic assays is uncertain in this patient population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-invasive-pulmonary-aspergillosis-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. </p><p>At present, fungal cultures with histopathology are the foundation for the diagnosis of invasive disease in the HIV-infected host. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18396808\"><span class=\"h2\">Culture and histology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Culture and histology offer complimentary information and both should be obtained whenever feasible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9541284\"><span class=\"h3\">Culture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Aspergillus</em> species grow rapidly and may be visible within several days of incubation, even on standard blood agar; however, colonies of <em>Aspergillus</em> may be overgrown by bacteria in standard media. In contrast, pure colonies of <em>Aspergillus</em> grow well on fungal media, including Sabouraud's dextrose agar or Potato dextrose agar. Thus, these special media are preferred, and should be requested, for <em>Aspergillus</em> isolation. </p><p>However, a culture alone may be only indicative of colonization; histopathology is required to document tissue invasion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-invasive-pulmonary-aspergillosis-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. If a biopsy is not possible because of clinical limitations (eg, thrombocytopenia), a positive culture in the appropriate clinical setting (advanced immunosuppression with pulmonary infiltrates) without isolation of any other potential pathogens can be considered a &quot;probable&quot; diagnosis of aspergillosis. (See <a href=\"#H1439438\" class=\"local\">'Disease classifications'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9541277\"><span class=\"h3\">Histopathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Special stains for histopathologic examination of <em>Aspergillus</em> species (eg, periodic acid-Schiff or methenamine silver stain) demonstrate septate hyphae with characteristic acute angle branching (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F70889\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70889 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-invasive-pulmonary-aspergillosis-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Invasive disease is diagnosed when these hyphae are found to be eroding into tissue structures.</p><p>However, histopathology alone does not confirm a diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis since there are other fungal pathogens that have similar morphology; a culture is required for confirmation of <em>Aspergillus</em> as the implicated pathogen. When a culture is positive for <em>Aspergillus</em> and histopathology reveals tissue invasion, a &quot;definitive&quot; diagnosis of aspergillosis can be made [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-invasive-pulmonary-aspergillosis-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18396815\"><span class=\"h2\">Antigen detection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Galactomannan is a cell-wall polysaccharide specific to <em>Aspergillus</em> species that is released with the growth of hyphae and is detectable in serum or other body fluids (eg, bronchoalveolar lavage specimens) during invasive infection. In a meta-analysis of the use of galactomannan in approximately 4000 patients with either hematologic malignancy or history of organ transplantation, the overall sensitivity and specificity was 71 and 89 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-invasive-pulmonary-aspergillosis-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

In fact, Beta-D-glucan has been reported to be a supportive non-invasive adjunctive test for the diagnosis of Pneumocystis pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-invasive-pulmonary-aspergillosis-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].

Likely reasons for the wide ranging differences in sensitivity and specificities include variations in the commercial diagnostic assays used, study participants who were enrolled, and study design. Most of these studies did not evaluate the utility of the test in the HIV-infected host with suspected invasive aspergillosis.

(See <a href=\"#H9541090\" class=\"local\">'General background'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in HIV-infected patients is based upon a combination of clinical risks, symptoms and signs, culture, and histopathology. Definitive diagnosis requires documentation of characteristic acute angle branching septate hyphae invading tissue on biopsy specimens with culture confirmation. (See <a href=\"#H9541246\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic assays'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Classes of antifungal agents with in vitro activity against <em>Aspergillus</em> species include the triazoles, polyenes, and the echinocandins. (See <a href=\"#H3080073\" class=\"local\">'Available antifungal agents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the HIV-infected patient with proven or probable invasive aspergillosis, we recommend <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a> rather than amphotericin B (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). The recommended dosing regimen is 6 mg per kilogram intravenously (IV) twice daily on day one, followed by 4 mg per kilogram IV twice daily. (See <a href=\"#H3080638\" class=\"local\">'Approach to antifungal treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most patients with invasive aspergillosis require treatment for 6 to 12 weeks; longer therapy may be required depending on the patient&rsquo;s clinical response. (See <a href=\"#H11820725\" class=\"local\">'Duration of therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The triazoles have significant drug interactions with several antiretroviral medications; thus, a careful review of potential drug-drug interactions is indicated. (See <a href=\"#H111871298\" class=\"local\">'Drug interactions with antifungal agents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antiviral therapy should be initiated in most patients as soon as possible after starting antifungal therapy. Some patients are seriously ill and may have significant co-morbid conditions that may be exacerbated by the effects of antifungal therapy. In such patients, it is reasonable to delay the initiations of ART to assess for the adverse effects of antifungal therapy. In this case, ART should be initiated within two weeks of starting antifungal medications. (See <a href=\"#H600284961\" class=\"local\">'When to start antiretroviral therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When possible, it is optimal to use an antiretroviral therapy regimen that includes drugs that are minimally or not metabolized via the cytochrome P450 pathway. Such medications include the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=raltegravir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">raltegravir</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dolutegravir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dolutegravir</a>. (See <a href=\"#H1271491\" class=\"local\">'Selection of antiretroviral therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Therapeutic drug monitoring should be considered in HIV-infected patients, particularly those taking medications with potential drug-drug interactions. A target blood concentration for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=voriconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">voriconazole</a> trough levels is 2 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span>. (See <a href=\"#H18396964\" class=\"local\">'Therapeutic drug monitoring'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-treatment-of-invasive-pulmonary-aspergillosis-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Mylonakis E, Barlam TF, Flanigan T, Rich JD.
