Efforts to delay delivery in women presenting with acute preterm labor have been largely unsuccessful. For this reason, much attention has focused on preventive strategies, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progesterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">progesterone</a> supplementation.</p><p>Although supplemental <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progesterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">progesterone</a> appears to be effective in preventing preterm birth in some high-risk women, it should not be seen as a panacea. For example, even if all pregnant women in the United States with a history of preterm birth receive progesterone prophylaxis, it is estimated that the risk of preterm birth would be reduced by 20 percent and the absolute preterm birth rate would be reduced by only 0.01 percent because most preterm births are not recurrences and prophylaxis has limited efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progesterone-supplementation-to-reduce-the-risk-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. If women with a short cervix are also identified and treated, an additional absolute risk reduction of 0.02 percent would be achieved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progesterone-supplementation-to-reduce-the-risk-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>This topic will review issues related to use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progesterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">progesterone</a> for prevention of preterm birth. Progesterone supplementation is only one component of risk reduction. Risk factors for preterm birth and other potential interventions for reducing risk are discussed separately.

In early pregnancy, progesterone is critical for pregnancy maintenance until the placenta takes over this function at 7 to 9 weeks of gestation, and its name is derived from this function: pro-gestational steroidal ketone. Indeed, removal of the source of progesterone (the corpus luteum) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progesterone-supplementation-to-reduce-the-risk-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] or administration of a progesterone receptor antagonist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progesterone-supplementation-to-reduce-the-risk-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] readily induces abortion before 7 weeks (49 days) of gestation. </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=progesterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Progesterone</a> appears to be important in maintaining uterine quiescence in the latter half of pregnancy; however, the mechanism is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progesterone-supplementation-to-reduce-the-risk-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. Functional withdrawal of progesterone activity at the level of the uterus appears to occur proximate to the onset of labor both at term and preterm, without a significant change in serum progesterone levels in the weeks preceding labor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progesterone-supplementation-to-reduce-the-risk-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/7-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-14</a>]. Progesterone also prevents apoptosis in fetal membrane explants under both basal and pro-inflammatory conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progesterone-supplementation-to-reduce-the-risk-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>] and thus may protect the membranes from preterm premature rupture and, in turn, preterm birth. </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=progesterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Progesterone</a> supplementation may enhance these actions, which are likely mediated via progesterone-receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progesterone-supplementation-to-reduce-the-risk-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

The FDA concluded the data in the manufacturer&rsquo;s application did not sufficiently support the efficacy of progesterone 8 percent gel compared with placebo in reducing the risk of preterm births before 33 completed weeks of gestation among women with a short cervical length, but the drug was safe in this population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progesterone-supplementation-to-reduce-the-risk-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. The FDA was critical of the statistical methods used in the key trial and noted that most of the apparent treatment benefit occurred in non-US centers. The safety profile of vaginal progesterone in the first trimester of pregnancy is supported by extensive data from patients who received the drug for luteal support, while large trials during the second and third trimester in women at increased risk of preterm birth support its safety later in gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/progesterone-supplementation-to-reduce-the-risk-of-spontaneous-preterm-birth/abstract/25,80,81\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,80,81</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2814898524\"><span class=\"h2\">Oral progesterone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An oral micronized preparation of natural <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progesterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">progesterone</a> also exists.

(See <a href=\"#H22816883\" class=\"local\">'Pregnancies likely to benefit from progesterone supplementation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with a singleton pregnancy who have had a previous spontaneous singleton preterm birth, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progesterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">progesterone</a> treatment (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). We suggest intramuscular injections of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyprogesterone-caproate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyprogesterone caproate</a> rather than vaginal progesterone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>), beginning in the second trimester (16 to 20 weeks) and continuing through 36+6 weeks of gestation. We prescribe 250 mg weekly. Daily natural progesterone administered vaginally is a reasonable alternative. (See <a href=\"#H14419345\" class=\"local\">'Spontaneous singleton preterm birth in prior pregnancy'</a> above.) We also follow their cervical length with serial ultrasound examinations until 24 weeks of gestation, and consider cerclage if cervical length is &le;25 mm.
