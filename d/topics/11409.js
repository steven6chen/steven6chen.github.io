These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscles in the eyelids and around the eyes &ndash; If MG only affects these muscles, doctors call it &quot;ocular myasthenia gravis.&quot; About half of all people with MG have this type.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Jaw muscles</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arm or leg muscles</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscles that help with breathing</p><p/><p>MG happens because of a problem with the body's infection-fighting system, called the &quot;immune system.&quot; The immune system normally makes proteins called &quot;antibodies,&quot; which help to prevent infection. However, in people with MG, the immune system makes some antibodies that attack the connections between nerves and muscles by mistake.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H78151894\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of MG?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main symptom is muscle weakness. It can come and go, and is often worse later in the day. It can cause:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Droopy eyelids</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blurry vision or double vision</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble chewing food - The jaw muscles might feel tired about halfway through a meal.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble swallowing</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble talking &ndash; A person might speak in a lower voice than usual, or sound like he or she has a cold or stuffy nose.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loss of expression on the face</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Head that feels heavy or drops forward</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing &ndash; A person might feel short of breath, take extra breaths, or feel like it takes a lot of effort to breathe.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weakness &ndash; It might be hard to lift the arms or legs, open the fingers, or lift a foot.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H78151909\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. The doctor or nurse will do an exam and learn about your symptoms. You might also have:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests to look for certain antibodies that are found in people with MG.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electrical tests of nerves and muscles &ndash; These can show if nerves are carrying electrical signals normally and if muscles are responding correctly to electrical signals.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Imaging tests, such as CT or MRI scans &ndash; Most people with MG have some changes in the thymus gland. This is a gland in the chest that is part of the immune system. Imaging tests can show changes, including a tumor on the thymus gland. Some people have a CT scan or MRI of the head. It can show if a different condition is causing symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A test with a medicine called <a href=\"topic.htm?path=edrophonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">edrophonium</a> (brand name: Enlon) &ndash; Doctors give this through a thin tube that goes into a vein, called an &quot;IV.&quot; If the medicine helps the eye and eyelid muscles work better, it could be a sign of MG. This test is often called the &quot;Tensilon test.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ice pack test &ndash; During this test, a doctor puts a cool pack on the eyelids. If the eyelids open better after resting under the cool pack, this could be a sign of MG.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H78151926\"><span class=\"h1\">How is MG treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatments include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to treat muscle weakness, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyridostigmine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">pyridostigmine</a> (brand names: Mestinon, Regonol)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines that treat the immune system over time, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">prednisone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">azathioprine</a> (brand names: Azasan, Imuran)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fast-acting immune system treatments, such as:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>A medicine called &quot;intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">immune globulin</a>&quot; (IVIG) &ndash; This medicine is given through an IV.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Plasma exchange (also called &quot;plasmapheresis&quot;) &ndash; For this treatment, a machine pumps blood from the body and removes substances from the blood that are attacking the nerves and muscles. Then the machine returns the blood to the body.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery to remove the thymus gland</p><p/><p>If MG attacks the muscles that help with breathing, it can cause severe breathing problems. These are usually treated in the intensive care unit (also called the &quot;ICU&quot;).</p><p>Children with MG can take some of the same medicines as adults. But some medicines used to treat MG can cause more serious problems in children if used for a long time. Surgery to remove the thymus gland is safe for children and often works well.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H78151942\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you want to get pregnant, talk to your doctor or nurse before you start trying to have a baby. Pregnancy can make MG worse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H78151957\"><span class=\"h1\">What else should I know about MG?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People who have MG that affects more than just the eyes can have serious problems if they get the flu or pneumonia. For this reason, it is especially important that they get the flu shot every year and the pneumonia vaccine at least one time.</p><p>Some medicines can make MG worse. Talk to your doctor or nurse before you take any medicines, including over-the-counter medicines. If you get a prescription for a new medicine, ask if it is safe to take when you have MG.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H78151972\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dysarthria-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Dysarthria (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dysphagia-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Dysphagia (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperkalemia-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hyperkalemia (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=muscular-dystrophy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Muscular dystrophy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=periodic-paralysis-syndrome-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Periodic paralysis syndrome (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bells-palsy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Bell's palsy (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
