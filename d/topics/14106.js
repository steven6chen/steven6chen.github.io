Adolescents may seek information regarding pregnancy directly from their health care provider. Laws regarding confidential pregnancy testing and counseling vary from state to state.

Although it increased transiently between 2005 and 2007, it decreased to historic lows between 2007 and 2015 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F72368\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72368 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], largely related to increased contraceptive use and increased use of highly effective methods of contraception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-adolescents/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=contraception-issues-specific-to-adolescents#H707998035\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Contraception: Issues specific to adolescents&quot;, section on 'Choosing a method'</a>.)</p><p>In 2015, the birth rates among teenagers aged 10 to 14 years and 15 to 19 years were 0.2 and 22.3 per 1000, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The overall birth rate for teenagers 15 to 19 years of age fell by 8 percent between 2014 and 2015: 9 percent for those 15 to 17 years of age and 7 percent for those 18 to 19 years of age. However, <span class=\"nowrap\">racial/ethnic</span> disparities continue. The birth rate in Hispanic teens and non-Hispanic black teens was approximately twice that in non-Hispanic white teens; the birth rate in American <span class=\"nowrap\">Indian/Alaska</span> Native teens was approximately 1.5 times greater than in non-Hispanic white teens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-adolescents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Adolescents with mental health symptoms or major mental illness (eg, major depression, bipolar disorder, psychotic disorders) appear to be at increased risk of pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-adolescents/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>Approximately 10 percent of all women aged 15 to 19, and 19 percent of those who have sexual intercourse, become pregnant. Most pregnancies among teenagers are unintended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-adolescents/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. Among 15- to 19-year-old females with unintended pregnancies resulting in live births between 2004 and 2008, 50 percent were not using any method of contraception before the pregnancy (24 percent because their partner did not want to use contraception), 31 percent believed they could not get pregnant at the time, 13 percent had trouble getting contraception, and 22 percent did not mind if they got pregnant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-adolescents/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Surveillance data indicate that approximately 17 percent of births to teenagers 15 to 19 years of age in the United States in 2015 were repeat births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-adolescents/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Risk factors for repeat teenage pregnancy include depression, history of abortion, and living with a partner or increased partner support [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-adolescents/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Protective factors include higher levels of education and use of contraception, particularly long-acting reversible contraceptives.</p><p>Approximately one in five infants born to adolescents is fathered by men five or more years older than the mother. In a large observational study, 36 percent of adolescents with first pregnancy before age 15 years and 17 percent of adolescents with first pregnancy between 15 and 19 years reported that their sexual partner was &ge;6 years older than they were at the time of their first sexual encounter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-adolescents/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS OF PREGNANCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis and clinical manifestations of early pregnancy are discussed in detail separately.

A pregnant adolescent may complain of missing her periods or of irregular periods. Some adolescents mistake implantation bleeding in early pregnancy for normal menstrual bleeding and, thus, do not seek pregnancy testing, whereas others are more likely than adults to report early first-trimester vaginal bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-adolescents/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Pediatric health care providers need to be aware that an adolescent may or may not have considered the possibility of pregnancy or may present with vague complaints with suspected pregnancy as her &quot;hidden agenda.&quot; One study compared the presenting complaints and historical information of pregnant adolescents (&le;16 years) whose diagnosis of pregnancy was made or not made in the emergency department of a tertiary-care hospital [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-adolescents/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adolescents whose pregnancy was diagnosed more frequently had complaints related to the abdomen or genitourinary system than those whose pregnancy was not diagnosed (91 versus 22 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Less than 10 percent of the patients who had pregnancy diagnosed mentioned the possibility of pregnancy at initial triage, and 10.5 percent denied having had sexual activity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>68 percent of patients whose pregnancies were not diagnosed (ie, who were pregnant at the time of the visit, but in whom the diagnosis was missed) had no documentation of their menstrual or sexual history.</p><p/><p>Thus, pediatric health care providers should elicit a detailed menstrual and sexual history routinely from their female adolescent patients, regardless of the nature of their complaints. Historical features, such as amenorrhea, morning sickness, urinary frequency, increased appetite, weight gain or bloating, and tender or tingling breasts, are suggestive of pregnancy but are not reliable indicators for excluding pregnancy when absent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-adolescents/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

Teenagers may have a variety of emotional responses to a newly diagnosed pregnancy, the most extreme of which may be suicidality, particularly if there is a history of previous suicide attempt. (See <a href=\"#H656345731\" class=\"local\">'Posttest counseling'</a> below.)</p><p>The conversation about how the teen would respond to the reality of pregnancy or motherhood before the test is performed also may force the teen to consider the potential consequences of her actions. Such a conversation may be a useful adjunctive strategy for pregnancy prevention in girls who are not pregnant.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H656345731\"><span class=\"h3\">Posttest counseling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinicians providing posttest counseling must bear in mind the laws regarding the adolescent's right to confidentiality in their state. In some states, the provider &quot;shall not&quot; disclose the information to a parent or guardian; in others, they &quot;may&quot; do so. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=confidentiality-in-adolescent-health-care#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Confidentiality in adolescent health care&quot;, section on 'Parental notification'</a>.) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Positive pregnancy test</strong> &ndash; The first step after confirming a pregnancy with a pregnancy test is informing the adolescent of the test result and eliciting her thoughts and feelings about the test result. The second step is determining whether and how she wants to inform her parent(s) and the father of the baby. We usually encourage the pregnant adolescent to inform her parent(s) and the father of the baby, but some adolescents have valid reasons not to do so (eg, if doing so with threaten her safety).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The clinician should anticipate a variety of responses from the adolescent who is confirmed to be pregnant: ambivalence, apathy, fear, tearfulness, or even shock [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-adolescents/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Providing emotional support to the adolescent is important at this time, and these feelings should be acknowledged as normal. Factual information regarding the duration of pregnancy and estimated due date should be provided despite her emotional response.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Some adolescents perceive positive consequences of pregnancy or childbearing and want to be pregnant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-adolescents/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. In a nationally representative survey of 975 adolescent females, 15 percent reported a positive pregnancy attitude (response to the question: &quot;If you got pregnant now, how would you feel? Would you be very upset, a little upset, a little pleased, or very pleased?&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-adolescents/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Another study surveyed 200 pregnant 13- to 18-year-olds to see why they failed to use contraception before conception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-adolescents/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Nearly one-fifth of the girls responded that they wanted to get pregnant, and another one-fifth that they didn't mind being pregnant. In a separate case-control study, adolescents who wanted a baby were more likely to be Hispanic, married, and out of school before becoming pregnant than teens who reported their pregnancy &quot;just happened&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-adolescents/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Other adolescents may feel stigmatized by pregnancy. In one report, 39 percent of 925 adolescents (&lt;18 years) who were interviewed on the postpartum ward reported feeling stigmatized by their pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-adolescents/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Feeling stigmatized was independently associated with multiple factors, including white <span class=\"nowrap\">race/ethnicity,</span> not being <span class=\"nowrap\">legally/common-law</span> married or engaged to the baby's father, feelings of social isolation, aspirations to complete college, experiencing verbal abuse or being fearful of being hurt by other teenagers, and experiencing family criticism. Cultural attitudes regarding out-of-wedlock pregnancies must be considered when assessing response to a positive test in an adolescent from an immigrant family [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-adolescents/abstract/11,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Suicidal ideation occurs in 5 to 14 percent of women during pregnancy and the postpartum period, and teenagers are at greater risk than older women to complete suicide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-adolescents/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Self-poisoning during the early first trimester of pregnancy in adolescent and adult women has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-adolescents/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. A prior history of a suicidal attempt may place an adolescent diagnosed with a pregnancy at risk for a repeat suicidal attempt [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-adolescents/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=suicidal-behavior-in-children-and-adolescents-epidemiology-and-risk-factors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Suicidal behavior in children and adolescents: Epidemiology and risk factors&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">After exploring the adolescent's feelings about the pregnancy, it is important to determine how she wants to go about informing her parent(s) and the father of the baby. The adolescent may not be comfortable informing her parents at the visit when pregnancy is confirmed, although the health care provider may feel parental involvement is the next best step to take. Special attention should be given to teenagers belonging to cultures that stigmatize unmarried mothers. Scheduling another office visit or a phone call in 24 to 48 hours for a follow-up in this situation is advisable. During this period, older adolescents may seek support from extended family and friends. In the author's clinical experience, most adolescents inform their parents within this time period and on their own terms. The provider may offer to help the adolescent disclose the information to her <span class=\"nowrap\">parents/guardians,</span> either by simply being present for support or by helping the adolescent initiate the discussion with her parents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-adolescents/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Additional information on providing confidential services to adolescents is described separately.

Emergency contraception may be warranted if the adolescent had unprotected sex in the past five days and does not desire pregnancy.

Estimating gestational age and expected date of delivery may be important information when making referral decisions. Gestational age can be estimated by a pregnancy calculator. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-assessment-of-gestational-age-date-of-delivery-and-fetal-weight#H1583796378\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prenatal assessment of gestational age, date of delivery, and fetal weight&quot;, section on 'Best estimate of delivery date'</a>.)</p><p>She should be referred as soon as possible to a clinician or clinic where comprehensive pregnancy counseling involving shared or collaborative decision-making is provided, unless the health care provider has expertise in pregnancy counseling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-adolescents/abstract/22,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,26</a>]. The adolescent should be offered all options (eg, abortion, adoption or kinship care, parenthood), especially when she has ambivalent feelings. Information regarding resources for pregnancy counseling is available through referrals from colleagues, women's clinics, and the internet. The location and limits of abortion clinics can be accessed through the <a href=\"http://prochoice.org/&amp;token=xpScufR+LN173/wSYmqLfSy2g72l6/WtaeIF20s1+VM=&amp;TOPIC_ID=110\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">National Abortion Federation</a>. If a pregnancy is considered too advanced for a termination (based on state law), it is important that the provider convey this as a possibility. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=counseling-regarding-pregnancy-termination\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Counseling regarding pregnancy termination&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Adolescents who decide to continue the pregnancy, or are uncertain whether they will continue the pregnancy, should initiate folic acid-containing prenatal vitamins and be counseled about the adverse effects of alcohol, drugs, and smoking on the developing fetus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-adolescents/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The health care provider should contact the adolescent approximately one week after the scheduled referral for follow-up information, to demonstrate concern for the adolescent, and to ensure appropriate care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-adolescents/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Most adolescents in the United States carry their pregnancies to term, with approximately 20 to 30 percent obtaining a legal abortion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-adolescents/abstract/28-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-33</a>]. The prevalence of abortion is higher among urban than rural-dwelling teens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-adolescents/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Common reasons adolescents give for choosing to have an abortion include being concerned about how the baby would change their lives, feeling they are not mature enough to be a parent, and financial issues.</p><p>Adolescents who decide to continue their pregnancies to term should be referred for specialized prenatal care as soon as possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-adolescents/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Adolescents younger than 15 years of age are less likely to receive prenatal care, and late entry into prenatal care has been positively correlated with preterm or low-birth-weight delivery and complications from preeclampsia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-adolescents/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>]. Early testing for sexually transmitted diseases, initiation of folic acid-containing prenatal vitamins and good nutrition, avoidance of alcohol and other substances, and assessment of underlying familial and medical conditions are important for a healthy pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-adolescents/abstract/11,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,27</a>]. The health care provider also can assist with smoking cessation by educating an adolescent smoker on the negative effects of nicotine on the developing fetus and by encouraging her to stop smoking. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-care-initial-assessment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prenatal care: Initial assessment&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cigarette-and-tobacco-products-in-pregnancy-impact-on-pregnancy-and-the-neonate\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cigarette and tobacco products in pregnancy: Impact on pregnancy and the neonate&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alcohol-intake-and-pregnancy#H450956500\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Alcohol intake and pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Perinatal outcome'</a>.)</p><p>Assistance from a social worker may be necessary to facilitate referral for comprehensive pregnancy counseling and enrollment into prenatal care and financial assistance programs because adolescents identify lack of finances, transportation, and waiting time for appointments as barriers to public prenatal care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-adolescents/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. Social workers also can help to arrange tutoring or enrollment in special educational programs to allow the adolescent to remain in school or complete her academic requirements for graduation at home.</p><p>In the United States, adolescents choosing to terminate the pregnancy should be aware that some states require parental notification for a legal abortion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-adolescents/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The gestational limit for a termination also varies by state. State-specific information about parental notification and gestational limits is available through the <a href=\"http://www.guttmacher.org/sections/abortion.php&amp;token=078xSHD9klE0epvHDhce6H1bjTBCmJx+xoc/a+T2CXp+BwfR068Y9Encg5UYW1ZsAbxseHbT/7SjkrEYvwuCyg==&amp;TOPIC_ID=110\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Guttmacher Institute</a>.</p><p>If an adolescent chooses abortion, parental notification of a termination in a minor is required only of health care personnel directly involved with providing legal abortions. This statute should not be interpreted as parental notification by the health care provider. A judicial bypass system also exists whereby a minor may ask a judge to consent to the procedure in lieu of a <span class=\"nowrap\">parent/guardian</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-adolescents/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The judge must consent if he or she has determined the adolescent to be a mature minor or if termination of pregnancy is in the minor's best interest.

Adequate nutrition during pregnancy is necessary to optimize maternal, fetal, and infant health. Pregnant adolescents are at particular risk for nutritional deficiencies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-adolescents/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Adolescents have increased nutritional needs related to normal pubertal changes (eg, increased height and changes in body composition). At baseline, they may have poor diet quality, with insufficient intake of micronutrients (eg, iron, folate, zinc, calcium) and excess intake of total fat, saturated fat, and sugar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-adolescents/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].

Adequate folate intake is important for prevention of some congenital anomalies and in red blood cell production. The preconceptional period is the optimal time for ensuring adequate folic acid consumption. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-supplementation-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Folic acid supplementation in pregnancy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nutrition-in-pregnancy#H717782123\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nutrition in pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Folic acid'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Calcium intake &ndash; Calcium intake during adolescence is an important determinant of bone mineralization and bone density.

The pregnancy termination rate among adolescents is lower than observed in 1990 (34 percent) and represents approximately one-fifth of all abortions performed in the United States. Data from 2011 indicate adolescents 18 to 19 years old account for 65 percent of abortions in adolescents and adolescents &lt;15 years old account for approximately 3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-adolescents/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>There are few data regarding the rate of adoptions from teen pregnancies. The rate of adoptions from pregnancies is not reported in the same manner as other reproductive health variables. The &quot;adoption at the time of birth&quot; rate has not been a standard pregnancy outcome measure in <span class=\"nowrap\">national/state</span> surveys. Estimating adoption rates is also difficult because infants may be relinquished at different times (eg, at birth or after being assigned to foster care). Data from the National Survey of Family Growth, which asked women about the status of each child ever born, indicate that the rate of premarital births with a plan for adoption declined from 9 percent in the 1970s to 3 percent in the 1980s and approximately 1 percent in the early 1990s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-adolescents/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>].</p><p>Adolescents appear to be at increased risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as preeclampsia, preterm birth, fetal growth restriction, and infant deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-adolescents/abstract/45-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-53</a>]. Whether these outcomes are the result of biologic immaturity or sociodemographic factors related to adolescent pregnancy (eg, nonwhite race, less well educated, unmarried, lower economic status) remains unclear. However, in a multicountry study that included 124,446 mothers &le;24 years, the risk of adverse outcome remained increased in adolescent (&le;19 years) compared with young adult mothers (ie, 20 to 24 years) after controlling for country, marital status, educational attainment, and parity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-adolescents/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Similar results were noted in an earlier study in a homogeneous population (134,088 white primiparous women &le;24 years from a single state in the United States) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-adolescents/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>Adverse outcomes in teenage pregnancies have been confirmed in some [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-adolescents/abstract/46,50-52,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,50-52,54</a>], but not all, studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-adolescents/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>].

The reason for the higher rates of instrumental delivery is not clear. Proposed explanations include the physical immaturity of the younger mother and fright or lack of cooperation during the second stage of labor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-in-adolescents/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Subsequent pregnancies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other reports have evaluated the outcomes of subsequent pregnancies after a first teenage pregnancy.
