In addition to aggressive medical therapy, two pathways of NSTEACS treatment have emerged: the early invasive strategy and the early conservative strategy. In the early invasive strategy, the more common approach in the modern treatment of NSTEACS, patients with high-risk features and without contraindications undergo coronary angiography and revascularization as deemed appropriate. Alternatively, there is a smaller group of patients with NSTEACS, generally those with low-risk features or at higher risk of complications from invasive angiography, who can be treated with an early conservative approach. In such conservatively treated patients, an ischemia-guided management strategy, dictated by stress test findings, results in outcomes similar to the early invasive strategy.</p><p>The role of stress testing in pre- and early post-discharge risk stratification of conservatively treated patients with NSTEACS will be reviewed here. The comprehensive risk stratification of patients with NSTEACS, as well as the approach to treatment, is discussed separately.

However, early post-discharge testing may be considered in lower-risk patients including those who have been revascularized (culprit lesion) and those who have remained asymptomatic with normal levels of physical activity during hospitalization.

The demonstration of significant ischemia identifies those who may benefit from coronary angiography and revascularization (or additional intensification of medical therapy in subjects who do not proceed with an invasive approach).

Stress testing is considered for both risk stratification and diagnostic purposes to determine the presence or absence of obstructive CAD.

Serious complications such as myocardial infarction (MI), cardiac arrest, or death are rare, although the risk in the post-MI population is potentially higher given the increased prevalence of obstructive coronary artery disease in these subjects. Contraindications to stress testing, both absolute and relative, are listed in a table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F80110\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80110 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-in-pre-discharge-risk-stratification-of-patients-with-non-st-elevation-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The benefits of stress testing may outweigh the risks in some subjects with a relative contraindication to testing, in whom the potential information gained by assessment of exercise capacity, blood pressure response to exercise, symptoms, and ischemia may outweigh the small risk of complications.

The choice of an imaging modality, when indicated, also depends on a variety of factors, including local availability, local expertise, cost, the patient's body habitus (eg, morbid obesity), limited acoustic windows for echocardiography (only if neither traditional nor contrast-enhanced echocardiographic imaging is adequate), radiation exposure, and the need for concomitant assessment of hemodynamics or valvular disease. The available modalities include exercise electrocardiography (ECG), exercise or vasodilator radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging using positron emission tomography (PET) or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), exercise or pharmacologic (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dipyridamole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dipyridamole</a>) stress echocardiography, and pharmacologic stress magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selecting-the-optimal-cardiac-stress-test#H688183934\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selecting the optimal cardiac stress test&quot;, section on 'Our approach to choosing the optimal stress test'</a>.)</p><p>Nearly all patients who are anticipated to exercise to a satisfactory workload should undergo an exercise stress test rather than a pharmacologic stress test. Exercise is the preferred method of stress because of the information gained on functional capacity and the presence or absence of symptoms with physical activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-in-pre-discharge-risk-stratification-of-patients-with-non-st-elevation-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In modern practice, an increasing proportion of post-myocardial infarction (MI) patients undergo pharmacologic stress testing because of factors that prevent or limit their ability to perform adequate exercise. This is particularly true for those referred for pre-discharge testing.</p><p>For decades, exercise ECG testing was the standard method for post-MI stress testing. When performed to an end point of symptoms or maximal exercise capacity, exercise ECG testing has moderate sensitivity and specificity for diagnosing obstructive coronary artery disease. However, many post-MI patients have ECGs that are uninterpretable or lower the sensitivity of exercise ECG testing. Stress testing with some form of cardiac imaging has been shown to increase the accuracy and incremental prognostic value compared with exercise ECG testing without imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-in-pre-discharge-risk-stratification-of-patients-with-non-st-elevation-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. As such, in modern practice, nearly all post-MI stress testing employs some form of imaging, with SPECT radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging and stress echocardiography being the two most commonly used modalities. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stress-testing-for-the-diagnosis-of-obstructive-coronary-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stress testing for the diagnosis of obstructive coronary heart disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Each stress modality has particular advantages and disadvantages, and there is some variability in the diagnostic and prognostic information provided. In general, our approach for choosing a specific stress testing modality is presented in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F115002\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115002 \">table 2</a>). For example, a postinfarction patient with unexplained exertional dyspnea may be best evaluated using exercise echocardiography. The presence of mitral regurgitation, pulmonary hypertension, and elevated left ventricular filling pressure can be assessed prior to exercise, and worsening of these conditions as causes of dyspnea can be assessed during bicycle exercise or immediately post-treadmill exercise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/stress-testing-in-pre-discharge-risk-stratification-of-patients-with-non-st-elevation-acute-coronary-syndrome/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>The general approach to selecting the optimal stress imaging modality is discussed in more detail separately.
