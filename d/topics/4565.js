The low rate of use is due both to the availability of drug-eluting stents and the lack of compelling trial data suggesting that the atherectomy devices offer better outcomes in a standalone or even an adjunctive role, except in cases where fibrocalcific plaque impedes device delivery or balloon expansion.</p><p>Coronary atherectomy and excimer laser angioplasty have all of the adverse events associated with other invasive cardiac procedures, such as coronary angiography and other forms of percutaneous coronary intervention. However, the rates of some of these are increased due to the factors related to both the equipment and the procedure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-diagnostic-cardiac-catheterization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of diagnostic cardiac catheterization&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=periprocedural-complications-of-percutaneous-coronary-intervention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Periprocedural complications of percutaneous coronary intervention&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The uses and efficacy of these devices are reviewed elsewhere.

There was a 3.6 percent incidence of non-ST elevation (non-Q wave) myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) and 1.1 percent incidence of ST elevation (Q wave) myocardial infarction (STEMI). The in-hospital MI rates were the same for directional atherectomy, extraction atherectomy, rotational atherectomy, and laser. The major etiologies for MI were coronary embolus and abrupt closure.</p><p>The true incidence of myocardial infarction (MI) is higher if assessed by more sensitive assays such as three-fold elevations in serum creatine kinase (CK-MB) or troponin concentrations.</p><p>The NACI registry also evaluated the incidence of major adverse clinical events at one year; the incidence of death, surgical revascularization, and target vessel revascularization was related to size of vessel undergoing intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-complications-of-atheroablative-devices/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The incidence of <span class=\"nowrap\">death/STEMI</span> was:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>7 percent for vessels &lt;2.75 mm</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>3.5 percent for vessels 2.75 to 3.25 mm</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>5.4 percent for vessels &gt;3.25 mm</p><p/><p>The incidence of surgical revascularization and target vessel revascularization was, respectively:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>15 and 32 for vessels &lt;2.75 mm</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>12, and 26 for vessels 2.75 to 3.25 mm</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>10 and 22 percent for vessels &gt;3.25</p><p/><p>Independent predictors of MI after these procedures were multivessel disease, unstable angina, high surgical risk, and the presence of thrombus prior to the procedure. The occurrence of MI was associated with an increase in hospital mortality (7.8 versus 0.8 percent), the need for coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) (13.6 versus 1.7 percent), and one-year mortality (12.9 versus 4.9 percent).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DIRECTIONAL CORONARY ATHERECTOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Directional coronary atherectomy (DCA) was used in the pre-stent era as a debulking device, as well as a potential tool to decrease the rate of restenosis. It is rarely used in clinical practice as current generation stents can be delivered to most lesions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ROTATIONAL ATHERECTOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Early studies with rotational atherectomy (Rotablator) revealed significant angiographic complications in up to 40 percent of lesions including dissection in 29 percent, side branch occlusion in 2 percent, distal embolization in 1 percent, no reflow in six percent, abrupt closure in 11 percent, and severe spasm in 14 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-complications-of-atheroablative-devices/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. With improvements in technique, however, the complication rates are now similar to those seen with balloon angioplasty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-complications-of-atheroablative-devices/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mortality rate &ndash; 0 to 3 percent.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ST elevation (Q wave) myocardial infarction (STEMI) &ndash; 0 to 4.4 percent.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Emergent coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) &ndash; 1 to 3 percent.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dissection &ndash; 11 to 13 percent.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute occlusion &ndash; 3 to 4 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abrupt closure &ndash; 1 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perforation &ndash; 0 to 1 percent</p><p/><p>However, patients who develop side branch occlusion may have an increased risk (up to 6 percent) of non-ST elevation (non-Q wave) myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-complications-of-atheroablative-devices/abstract/5,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7</a>]. They are also more likely to have transient wall motion abnormalities that have a longer duration than those that occur with percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty (PTCA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-complications-of-atheroablative-devices/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Dissection of the coronary artery is a potential complication of rotational atherectomy and is of particular concern since it is associated with a lower success rate, greater amount of residual stenosis, greater need for CABG, and reduced coronary blood flow (less than TIMI III). In a recent report of 2303 procedures, dissection occurred in 12.8 percent; predictors for this complication were tortuosity, procedure for primary lesion rather than restenosis, and non-type B lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-complications-of-atheroablative-devices/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The no reflow seen with rotational atherectomy is amenable to treatment with intracoronary <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroprusside-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroprusside</a>, or calcium channel blockade (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=nicardipine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nicardipine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diltiazem</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=verapamil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">verapamil</a>), with up to 67 percent of cases responding with an improvement in flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-complications-of-atheroablative-devices/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Concern remains, however, regarding the potentially higher incidence of NSTEMI seen with rotational atherectomy. As an example, this complication occurred in 19 percent of cases in one study of long lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-complications-of-atheroablative-devices/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Major ischemic complications with the rotablator are associated with female gender, long lesions, right coronary artery (RCA) stenoses, angulation of more than 60&ordm;, and bifurcation lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-complications-of-atheroablative-devices/abstract/4,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7</a>]. In patients undergoing atherectomy of a lesion in the left coronary system, the presence of a concomitant stenosis &ge;70 percent in the RCA significantly increases the risk of death, bypass surgery, and NSTEMI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-complications-of-atheroablative-devices/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The etiology for NSTEMI is possibly platelet activation and aggregation resulting in microvascular hypoperfusion. Support for this comes from one study of 75 patients who underwent radionuclide myocardial perfusion imaging with sestamibi prior to, during, and two days after atherectomy; 87 percent of patients had transient perfusion defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-complications-of-atheroablative-devices/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In contrast, among 30 patients who received treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abciximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abciximab</a> during the procedure, only 33 percent had transient perfusion defects.</p><p>No reflow is associated with a recent history of MI or unstable angina, and target lesions in the RCA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-complications-of-atheroablative-devices/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Prophylactic placement of a temporary pacemaker is recommended for target lesions in the RCA because of the increased incidence of heart block seen with use of the rotablator in this vessel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-complications-of-atheroablative-devices/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Most of these complications have been reduced with changes in rotablator technique, including lower rotational speeds (150,000 rather than 180,000 rpm), careful advancement to minimize speed drops, and intermittent lesion contact to allow perfusion to aid carrying away particulate debris. The STRATUS trial evaluated an aggressive rotablator technique, using <span class=\"nowrap\">burr/artery</span> ratios &gt;0.8 with no or minimal (1 atm) post dilatation, to a standard rotablator technique <span class=\"nowrap\">(burr/artery</span> ratio &lt;0.7), with 4 atm post-dilatation; the incidence of complications was lower with the standard technique but the rates of restenosis were the same. Although rotational atherectomy, either as a standalone technique or adjunctive to stenting, does not reduce restenosis, adjunctive use is sometimes needed to facilitate balloon expansion prior to stenting of undilatable fibrocalcific stenoses. Rotational atherectomy has been used also to debulk ostial side branches &quot;jailed&quot; by prior stenting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-complications-of-atheroablative-devices/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Patients deemed to be at high risk for a major ischemic complication may be candidates for placement of a percutaneous mechanical circulatory support system. In most cases, we use an intra-aortic balloon pump (IABP). In very high-risk cases that often include patients with significantly reduced left ventricular ejection fractions, we choose non-IABP percutaneous circulatory devices. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=short-term-mechanical-circulatory-assist-devices#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Short-term mechanical circulatory assist devices&quot;, section on 'Indications'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intraaortic-balloon-pump-counterpulsation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intraaortic balloon pump counterpulsation&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">EXCIMER LASER CORONARY ANGIOPLASTY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rate of major complication rates with percutaneous excimer laser coronary angioplasty (PELCA) is low and similar to conventional balloon angioplasty. Statistics from the United States and European PELCA registry, for example, revealed mortality rates less than 1 percent, emergent coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) in 3.1 percent, ST elevation (Q wave) myocardial infarction (STEMI) in 2.3 percent, embolization in 2.3 percent, and perforation in 2.4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-complications-of-atheroablative-devices/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Fatal complications were correlated with multivessel disease, an acute MI, and age above 70 years old. The incidence of major complications decreased after performance of 50 laser angioplasty procedures at one institution suggesting the presence of a learning curve.</p><p>Coronary arterial dissection is the most frequently observed laser complication, occurring in 22 percent of patients, with abrupt closure in 6.1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-complications-of-atheroablative-devices/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Dissection and perforation were seen more frequently in women, with the use of catheters &gt;1.4 mm in diameter, at vessel branch points, and in the treatment of total occlusions. Distal plaque embolization was seen most commonly in the treatment of saphenous graft lesions and was associated with MI in 44 percent of cases.</p><p>Angioscopy has been useful in identifying patients at risk for abrupt closure. Although the immediate post procedure residual stenosis was associated with a poor outcome, the most significant correlate of early closure was the presence of red thrombus (odds ratio 23) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-complications-of-atheroablative-devices/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

Coronary artery perforation occurs infrequently with excimer laser angioplasty. Since these devices are technically demanding and complications are often related to technique, their use is best reserved for higher-volume operators with considerable experience.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-complications-of-atheroablative-devices/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Waksman R, Ghazzal ZM, Baim DS, et al.
