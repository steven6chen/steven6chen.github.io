Recently induced lesions appear as angular excoriations with a serosanguineous crust; older lesions may be crusted or appear as hypertrophic nodules or atrophic scars. The appearance also depends on the specific method of SPD. Instrumentation may be employed by the use of fingers or fingernails, teeth, tissues, scissors, tweezers, or pins, producing deeper lesions that extend into the dermis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-picking-excoriation-disorder-and-related-disorders/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Complications of SPD include ulceration, infection, scarring, and disfigurement.</p><p>Frequently targeted sites are the face (in particular the nose, forehead, cheeks, and chin), the scalp, cuticles, extensor aspects of the extremities, shoulders, back, perianal region, and the scrotal area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/skin-picking-excoriation-disorder-and-related-disorders/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

Patients with SPD may present with features of impulse control disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, or both (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F67010\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67010 \">table 2</a>). SPD is included in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) as a separate diagnosis in the group of the obsessive-compulsive and related disorders. (See <a href=\"#H15211814\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H44169844\" class=\"local\">'Definition and classification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple psychiatric comorbidities are associated with SPD, including depression, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, alcohol abuse or dependence, and trichotillomania. (See <a href=\"#H15211830\" class=\"local\">'Comorbid conditions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SPD appears as excoriated, polymorphic lesions of variable size in all stages of evolution, localized most frequently on the face (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F60854%7EDERM%2F72635%7EDERM%2F53693%7EDERM%2F61686\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60854 graphicRef72635 graphicRef53693 graphicRef61686 \">picture 1A-D</a>). (See <a href=\"#H15211837\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of SPD is supported by a list of DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. SPD should be differentiated from the excoriations seen in subgroups of patients with primary pruritic skin conditions, chronic pruritus associated with systemic diseases, or other psychocutaneous diseases. (See <a href=\"#H44169867\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H572775\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psychiatric referral is appropriate for patients with SPD, although many patients will not accept it. Patients with SPD should be either co-managed by a mental health specialist and dermatologist, or managed by a specialist who has experience in both psychiatric and dermatologic disorders. (See <a href=\"#H1274832732\" class=\"local\">'General approach'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with associated intense pruritus, we suggest potent topical corticosteroids (group 1 to 3) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62402\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62402 \">table 1</a>) or intralesional <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a> acetonide (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For patients with acne excori&eacute;e, aggressive treatment of the underlying acne should be initiated. Patients with skin infections should be treated with topical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> systemic antibiotics. (See <a href=\"#H7747779\" class=\"local\">'Dermatologic therapies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest pharmacotherapy for patients with SPD whose severity interferes with daily functioning (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). When pharmacotherapy is selected for the treatment of SPD, we suggest an SSRI antidepressant (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Evidence is limited, but we typically initiate treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoxetine</a> 20 mg per day, titrating the dose up every two to four weeks as needed and tolerated. In patients presenting with features of delusional disorder, antipsychotic medications are indicated. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pimozide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Pimozide</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=olanzapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">olanzapine</a> are options, but have only been reported in case studies.

Patients with TTM present with bald spots in various body sites, including scalp (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F102267\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef102267 \">picture 7A</a>), face (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PSYCH%2F96905\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef96905 \">picture 8B</a>), arms, legs, and pubic areas. The diagnosis is supported by a list of DSM-5 diagnostic criteria. A skin biopsy may be useful to confirm the diagnosis and exclude other causes of hair loss.
