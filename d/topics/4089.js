The clinical significance of VUR has been based on the premise that VUR predisposes patients to acute pyelonephritis by transporting bacteria from the bladder to the kidney and recurrent urinary tract infection, which may lead to renal scarring, hypertension, and end-stage renal disease (ESRD). However, aspects of this long-held belief have been increasingly questioned. As a result, the clinical impact of VUR and its management remain uncertain and controversial.</p><p>The presentation, diagnosis, and clinical course of primary VUR will be reviewed here. The management of primary VUR is discussed elsewhere in the program. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-vesicoureteral-reflux\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of vesicoureteral reflux&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION AND PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>VUR is the retrograde passage of urine from the bladder into the upper urinary tract. It is divided into two categories: primary and secondary based on the underlying pathogenesis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Primary VUR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary VUR, the most common form of reflux, is due to incompetent or inadequate closure of the ureterovesical junction (UVJ), which contains a segment of the ureter within the bladder wall (intravesical ureter). Normally, reflux is prevented during bladder contraction by fully compressing the intravesical ureter and sealing it off with the surrounding bladder muscles.</p><p>In primary VUR, failure of this anti-reflux mechanism is due to a congenitally short intravesical ureter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F54236\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54236 \">figure 1</a>). The intravesical ureter length may be genetically determined, which may explain the increased incidence in family members of patients with VUR.</p><p>Spontaneous resolution of primary low-grade VUR commonly occurs with patient growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-course-of-primary-vesicoureteral-reflux/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. As the bladder grows, the intravesical ureter increases in length, improving the function of the anti-reflux mechanism. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Likelihood of resolution'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Secondary VUR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Secondary VUR is a result of abnormally high voiding pressure in the bladder that results in failure of the closure of the UVJ during bladder contraction. Secondary VUR is often associated with anatomic (eg, posterior urethral valves) or functional bladder obstruction (eg, bladder bowel dysfunction [BBD] and neurogenic bladder) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-course-of-primary-vesicoureteral-reflux/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The degree and chronicity of obstruction can influence the severity of VUR. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-posterior-urethral-valves#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of posterior urethral valves&quot;, section on 'Vesicoureteral reflux'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-complications-of-myelomeningocele-spina-bifida\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinary tract complications of myelomeningocele (spina bifida)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary VUR is the most common urologic finding in children, occurring in approximately 1 percent of newborns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-course-of-primary-vesicoureteral-reflux/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The prevalence increases for neonates with prenatal hydronephrosis (up to 15 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-course-of-primary-vesicoureteral-reflux/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>], and for children with febrile urinary tract infections (UTIs) (ranging from 30 to 45 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-course-of-primary-vesicoureteral-reflux/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The risk for primary VUR varies based on ethnicity, gender, and age. This was shown in a retrospective study from a single urban center in the United States that diagnosed VUR in 3661 of 15,504 children who were screened by a voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-course-of-primary-vesicoureteral-reflux/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The following observations were made:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ethnicity &ndash; White children were three times more likely to have VUR than black children. The maximal grade of reflux was significantly lower in black children.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sex &ndash; In this cohort, girls were twice as likely to have reflux as boys. However, the sex difference is smaller in countries where circumcision is not routinely performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-course-of-primary-vesicoureteral-reflux/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. In contrast, there is a male predominance in patients who present with prenatal hydronephrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-course-of-primary-vesicoureteral-reflux/abstract/3,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,10</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Likelihood of resolution'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age &ndash; Young children and infants (younger than two years of age) were more likely to have VUR than older children as there is spontaneous resolution with growth in the majority of affected children. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Likelihood of resolution'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>In the United States, the predominance of female gender and white ethnicity appears to be greater in the subset of young children who are diagnosed after an episode of UTI. This was illustrated in the Randomized Intervention for Vesicoureteral Reflux (RIVUR) trial that reported that 81 percent of the 607 children with VUR diagnosed after febrile <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> symptomatic UTI were white and 92 percent were females [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-course-of-primary-vesicoureteral-reflux/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In contrast, there is a male predominance in patients with prenatal presentation. In Europe and Asia, male predominance persists through early infancy because neonatal circumcision is less commonly performed, resulting in a higher incidence of UTI. (See <a href=\"#H759413688\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-infections-in-children-epidemiology-and-risk-factors#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinary tract infections in children: Epidemiology and risk factors&quot;, section on 'Lack of circumcision'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is a genetic predisposition for primary vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), as documented by a systematic review that found prevalence rates of 27.4 percent for siblings of a patient with VUR, and 35.7 percent for children of an affected parent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-course-of-primary-vesicoureteral-reflux/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The risk of VUR decreased as the age of the screened family member increased, at an estimated annual resolution rate of 4 percent. The familial rate was lower for more severe compared with milder forms of VUR (9.8 percent for Grades III to IV versus 16.7 percent for Grades I to II). (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Grading'</a> below.)</p><p>Additional data supporting a genetic predisposition was provided by a small study of multiple gestation births that found a higher VUR rate in identical twins (12 out of 15 twin sets, 80 percent) compared with fraternal twins (11 out of 31 twin sets, 35 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-course-of-primary-vesicoureteral-reflux/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>The genetic loci underlying these associations as well as the mode(s) of inheritance are unknown. There is speculation that the length of the intravesical ureter may be genetically dictated, but genome linkage studies in 320 families with at least two affected siblings failed to detect any association with six candidate genes (<em>AGTR2</em>, <em>HNF1B</em>, <em>PAX2</em>, <em>RET</em>, <em>ROBO2</em>, and <em>UPKA3</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-course-of-primary-vesicoureteral-reflux/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Research studies have also suggested a genetic susceptibility of individuals to renal scarring, which may explain the variability in scarring in many children with VUR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-course-of-primary-vesicoureteral-reflux/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H759413688\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2169428111\"><span class=\"h2\">Prenatal presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of VUR is suggested by the finding of hydronephrosis on prenatal ultrasonography.

This variability is primarily due to differences in the definition of prenatal hydronephrosis and the indications for and timing of postnatal evaluation.</p><p>In the larger of the systematic reviews conducted by the American Urological Association (AUA), prenatal hydronephrosis was defined as a renal pelvic diameter (RPD) &ge;4 mm during the second trimester and &ge;7 mm during the third trimester [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-course-of-primary-vesicoureteral-reflux/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Radionuclide cystogram (RNC) is an alternative modality. However, despite the increased radiation exposure associated with VCUG, VCUG provides greater anatomic detail. Specifically, RNC does not reliably show bladder wall appearance or Grade I reflux. RNC also does not demonstrate urethral anatomy in boys, which may be important in secondary causes of VUR (eg, posterior urethral valves). For this reason, in many centers (including ours), RNC is not used as the initial study, but may be used to monitor for persistent reflux in follow up studies.</p><p>If a VCUG or RNC is performed in infants and young children, the procedure needs to be done in referral centers that have expertise both in catheterization and, in the case of VCUG, determination and minimization of radiation exposure. In these settings, the complications of the procedures can be reduced by using standardized protocol developed by the Urology and Radiology sections of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), which focuses on patient safety by minimizing radiation exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-course-of-primary-vesicoureteral-reflux/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Grading</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The International Reflux Study Group (IRSG) developed a classification system that grades the severity of VUR based upon the degree of retrograde filling and dilation of the renal collecting system demonstrated by VCUG (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F67039\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67039 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-course-of-primary-vesicoureteral-reflux/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

A VCUG is performed in infants with persistent postnatal abnormal ultrasound findings or who develop a urinary tract infection (UTI).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Postnatal presentation &ndash; VCUG is obtained in children after a first febrile or symptomatic UTI if they are not toilet trained, have an anomaly on renal ultrasound, have hypertension or poor growth, or a have combination of temperature &ge;39&deg;C (102.2&deg;F) and a pathogen other than <em>Escherichia coli. </em>Other factors to consider are family preference and evaluation of compliance regarding medical care after discussion with the family<em>. </em>(See <a href=\"#H2309438512\" class=\"local\">'Postnatal presentation'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-infections-in-infants-older-than-one-month-and-young-children-acute-management-imaging-and-prognosis#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinary tract infections in infants older than one month and young children: Acute management, imaging, and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Voiding cystourethrogram'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>VCUG is the imaging test of choice to diagnose the presence and establish the degree of VUR. The severity of VUR is dependent upon the degree of retrograde filling and dilation of the renal collecting system. Established grading systems based upon VCUG findings are used to measure the severity of VUR (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F67039\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67039 \">figure 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Grading'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children with VUR are at risk for recurrent febrile or symptomatic UTIs, especially those with more severe VUR. (See <a href=\"#H33393660\" class=\"local\">'Recurrent urinary tract infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loss of renal parenchyma is a common finding in patients with VUR. It may lead to decreased renal function, and in some affected individuals with severe bilateral involvement to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Reduction in renal parenchyma is caused by the following mechanisms:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Acquired scarring is caused by renal parenchymal infection, which can occur in those with any grade of reflux, but is more common in those with higher VUR grades (III to V).
