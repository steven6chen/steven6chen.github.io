These glands make a hormone that helps control the amount of calcium in the blood. This hormone is called &quot;parathyroid hormone,&quot; or &quot;PTH.&quot;</p><p>Hyperparathyroidism is when your parathyroid glands make too much PTH. This causes too much calcium to build up in your blood. Primary hyperparathyroidism, the most common form of hyperparathyroidism, can happen when 1 or more of the glands get bigger than they should, or when a gland develops an abnormal growth. Cancer is another possible cause of hyperparathyroidism, but this is very rare.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25992216\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of hyperparathyroidism?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people with this condition have no symptoms. But some people do have symptoms that might be related to having more calcium in their blood than normal. These symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain in the joints</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling tired or weak</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loss of appetite</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling depressed</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble concentrating</p><p/><p>If your PTH and blood calcium levels get very high, you might get constipated, feel very thirsty, or urinate more often than usual. Some people have more serious symptoms, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Problems with how the kidneys work</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kidney stones</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weak bones</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gout (a kind of arthritis) or other problems in the joints</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chemical imbalances in the blood</p><p/><p>&quot;Parathyroid crisis&quot; is a rare but serious problem. It can happen if you have hyperparathyroidism and get sick with something that causes you to lose fluids (like vomiting or diarrhea). This causes the amounts of PTH and calcium in the blood to go up suddenly. If this happens, you might have belly pain, nausea, and sometimes problems thinking clearly and staying alert. It is important to see a doctor or nurse right away if you have hyperparathyroidism plus lasting vomiting or diarrhea, and can't keep fluids down.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25992231\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for hyperparathyroidism?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. A doctor or nurse can tell if you have hyperparathyroidism by measuring the levels of PTH and calcium in your blood. Many people with hyperparathyroidism do not notice any symptoms. The condition is often found when a doctor or nurse does a blood test for some other reason.</p><p>If you have hyperparathyroidism, your doctor or nurse might do other tests, too. You will probably get a special kind of X-ray to see if your bones are weaker than normal. Plus, you might get checked for kidney stones.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25992246\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to help my condition?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Even if you do not have any symptoms, there are things you can do to help prevent problems:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drink plenty of liquids, and try not to get dehydrated. This can help to prevent kidney stones.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stay active. This can help keep your calcium levels normal and your bones healthy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Try to get about 1000 milligrams of calcium each day. These tables show how much calcium is in certain foods and vitamin supplements (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F67824\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67824 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F70454\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70454 \">table 2</a>). It is better to get your calcium from foods and drinks rather than supplements. But if you aren't getting enough calcium from the foods you eat, you might need a supplement. Your doctor will let you know.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Try to get about 400 to 600 international units (IU) of vitamin D each day (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F77982\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77982 \">table 3</a>). Not having enough vitamin D can weaken your bones.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not take certain medicines that can affect the amount of calcium in the blood. Your doctor or nurse can tell you which medicines to avoid.</p><p/><p>Even if you feel healthy, your doctor or nurse should still check your blood calcium every 6 months. He or she will also do regular tests to check your kidneys and bones. (People whose bones are weakened because of their condition can get medicines to help protect their bones.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25992261\"><span class=\"h1\">How is hyperparathyroidism treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main treatment is surgery to remove the gland or glands that are causing the problem. (In most cases, surgery cures the hyperparathyroidism.) Still, people who have no symptoms do not always need surgery.</p><p>You will most likely need surgery if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The amount of calcium in your blood is much higher than normal;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your hyperparathyroidism is causing problems with your kidneys or bones;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You are younger than 50; or</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You are not able to get regular checkups and tests.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25992276\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoporosis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Osteoporosis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-density-testing-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Bone density testing (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-and-vitamin-d-for-bone-health-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Calcium and vitamin D for bone health (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=kidney-stones-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Kidney stones in adults (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-hyperparathyroidism-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Primary hyperparathyroidism (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoporosis-prevention-and-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Osteoporosis prevention and treatment (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-density-testing-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Bone density testing (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcium-and-vitamin-d-for-bone-health-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Calcium and vitamin D for bone health (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=kidney-stones-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Kidney stones in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
