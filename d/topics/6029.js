Women have a 2.5 percent lifetime risk of developing endometrial carcinoma, which accounts for 6 percent of all cancers in women. Fortunately, most cases are diagnosed at an early stage when surgery alone may be adequate for cure. Five-year survival rates for localized, regional, and metastatic disease are 96, 67, and 17 percent, respectively. </p><p>Preoperative evaluation, staging, and posttreatment surveillance for endometrial carcinoma will be reviewed here. Risk factors, clinical features, diagnosis, and histopathology, treatment with chemotherapy or radiation, and uterine sarcoma are discussed separately.

Laboratory evaluation or imaging studies should be selected as appropriate for the planned treatment (eg, major surgery, chemotherapy, radiation), patient comorbidities, and suspicion of metastases. Cervical cancer screening should be performed as appropriate.

Diagnosis of endometrial carcinoma is discussed in detail separately. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Assessment for hereditary cancer syndromes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer) is associated with a greatly increased risk of endometrial carcinoma, as well as colon and ovarian cancer and other Lynch-associated malignancies. Synchronous tumors discovered intraoperatively are common in these women. Synchronous tumors are simultaneously diagnosed primary tumors involving two different organs. These tumors do not represent a metastasis from one organ to the other. Women with endometrial carcinoma who have a family history suggestive of Lynch syndrome should be referred for genetic counseling and testing and also have testing of their tumor specimen for the mismatch repair proteins which characterize this syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lynch-syndrome-hereditary-nonpolyposis-colorectal-cancer-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lynch syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer): Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Testing of tumor specimen for mismatch repair deficiency'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Tumor markers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Measurement of the serum tumor marker CA 125 is a clinically useful test for predicting extrauterine spread of endometrial carcinoma. In a retrospective study of 141 women with endometrial carcinoma, a CA 125 value of greater than 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL</span> was reported to have a sensitivity of 78 percent and specificity of 81 percent for lymph node metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-pretreatment-evaluation-staging-and-surgical-treatment/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. These results have been confirmed by others, but the optimal threshold (eg, &gt;20, &gt;35, &gt;40 <span class=\"nowrap\">units/mL)</span> has not been determined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-pretreatment-evaluation-staging-and-surgical-treatment/abstract/4-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-8</a>]. No significant difference in CA 125 levels between pre- and postmenopausal women were found in the study cited; however, the average CA 125 value in premenopausal women is higher than it is in postmenopausal women.</p><p>Assay of serum CA 125 may also be useful for following patients after initial treatment, if levels were initially elevated. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Posttreatment surveillance'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pelvic or abdominal imaging to assess myometrial invasion or cervical involvement is unnecessary if surgical staging is planned. In the infrequent situation in which a patient is staged clinically, contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) appears to be the best radiographic modality for detecting myometrial invasion or cervical involvement when compared with nonenhanced MRI, ultrasound, or computed tomography (CT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-pretreatment-evaluation-staging-and-surgical-treatment/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. The majority of studies reported the sensitivity of enhanced MRI as approximately 80 to 90 percent (range 57 to 100 percent) for myometrial invasion; findings of sensitivity for cervical invasion were inconsistent ranging from 56 to 100 percent. Thus, a negative study does not provide assurance that complete surgical staging is not needed.</p><p>MRI is also the best imaging modality, compared with CT or positron emission tomography (PET) with or without CT, for detecting lymph node metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-pretreatment-evaluation-staging-and-surgical-treatment/abstract/11-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-14</a>]. However, preoperative imaging for this purpose is not necessary. Lymph nodes should be assessed intraoperatively in all women with endometrial carcinoma. This evaluation should consist of, at a minimum, palpation of pelvic and paraaortic nodes with biopsy or removal of enlarged nodes. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Lymph node evaluation'</a> below.)</p><p>A chest radiograph should be performed as part of the initial assessment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">STAGING AND PRIMARY SURGICAL TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endometrial carcinoma is surgically staged according to the joint 2010 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics <span class=\"nowrap\">(FIGO)/TNM</span> classification system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F51307\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51307 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F79873\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79873 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-pretreatment-evaluation-staging-and-surgical-treatment/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p>In the 2010 classification system, the definition of stage I was changed to include only two substages: IA (tumor limited to the endometrium or invades less than one-half of the myometrium) and IB (tumor invades one-half or more of the myometrium). In the previous surgical staging system for endometrial carcinoma, stage I had three substages: IA (tumor limited to the endometrium); IB (tumor invades less than one-half of the myometrium); or IC (tumor invades one-half or more of the myometrium). It appears that the 2010 staging system is better able to predict prognosis than the prior system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-pretreatment-evaluation-staging-and-surgical-treatment/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Therefore, when discussing studies published prior to 2010, we will use the older surgical staging system.</p><p>Surgery alone is usually curative for women with low risk disease (endometrioid histology, grade 1 or 2, confined to the endometrium [a subset of stage IA], no other risk factors for persistence or recurrence). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-adjuvant-treatment-of-endometrial-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to adjuvant treatment of endometrial cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgical staging overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Total extrafascial hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with pelvic and paraaortic lymph node dissection is the standard staging procedure for endometrial carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-pretreatment-evaluation-staging-and-surgical-treatment/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Vaginal, laparoscopic or robot-assisted approaches are also possible (see <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Other surgical approaches'</a> below).</p><p>As with other intraabdominal gynecologic malignancies, complete staging includes biopsy of any areas where metastases are suspected; most surgeons record results of peritoneal cytology, but these are not part of FIGO staging. Cytoreduction often is performed when metastases are evident. An omentectomy is frequently done for patients with serous or clear cell histology. Pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes sampling or removal are performed selectively. At a minimum, these nodes are palpated and enlarged or suspicious lymph nodes are removed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-pretreatment-evaluation-staging-and-surgical-treatment/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Intraoperative gross inspection and frozen section</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The uterine surgical specimen should be opened in the operating room to evaluate disease extent. The extent of uterine disease provides some direction as to the extent of surgical staging that is called for (ie, whether lymph node evaluation is needed), which, in turn, may impact on recommendations for adjuvant treatment. A meta-analysis of 16 studies including 2567 women with endometrial cancer evaluated the diagnostic performance of intraoperative gross inspection to determine the depth of myometrial invasion and found a sensitivity of 75 percent and a specificity of 92 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-pretreatment-evaluation-staging-and-surgical-treatment/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H6650537\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence of and risk factors for nodal metastases'</a> below.)</p><p>Frozen section of the area of deepest invasion may provide additional information, but studies comparing results of frozen section with final pathology have not reported consistently high concordance, especially in low-stage and low-grade disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-pretreatment-evaluation-staging-and-surgical-treatment/abstract/21-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-26</a>]. Variable concordance between specialist gynecologic pathologists and general pathologists has also been reported and is of concern [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-pretreatment-evaluation-staging-and-surgical-treatment/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. As an example, in a large study (n = 482) of women with grade 1 endometrial adenocarcinoma, the grade on final pathologic analysis was higher than that from intraoperative frozen section in 15 percent of patients, 1 percent of whom had a grade higher than 2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-pretreatment-evaluation-staging-and-surgical-treatment/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In contrast, another study (n = 784) found that clinically significant discordance between frozen section and final pathology evaluation occurred in only 1.3 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-pretreatment-evaluation-staging-and-surgical-treatment/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Lymph node evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One of the most important prognostic factors for endometrial carcinoma is the presence of extrauterine disease, particularly pelvic and paraaortic lymph node metastases.

Some data suggest that removal of the circumflex iliac nodes to the distal external iliac nodes increases the risk of lymphedema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-pretreatment-evaluation-staging-and-surgical-treatment/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p>Paraaortic node dissection consists of resection of nodal tissue over the distal vena cava from the level of the inferior mesenteric artery to the mid right common iliac artery and between the aorta and the left ureter from the inferior mesenteric artery to the left mid common iliac artery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-pretreatment-evaluation-staging-and-surgical-treatment/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Some experts extend the paraaortic lymph node dissection (LND) superiorly to the level of the renal veins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-pretreatment-evaluation-staging-and-surgical-treatment/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. </p><p>In our practice, the nodal chains that we assess when staging endometrial carcinoma include the left and right paraaortic and, in the pelvis, the left and right common, external and internal iliac and obturator chains.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6650587\"><span class=\"h3\">Controversies in lymph node assessment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is ongoing controversy over whether pelvic and paraaortic node sampling or complete LND should be performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-pretreatment-evaluation-staging-and-surgical-treatment/abstract/37-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">37-40</a>]. The status of both the pelvic and paraaortic lymph nodes should be assessed intraoperatively in all patients, as advised by the FIGO surgical and pathologic staging system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-pretreatment-evaluation-staging-and-surgical-treatment/abstract/19,41-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,41-43</a>]. However, the type and extent of LND were not specified.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6650486\"><span class=\"h4\">Assessment of paraaortic nodes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Paraaortic nodes may be positive in the absence of positive pelvic nodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-pretreatment-evaluation-staging-and-surgical-treatment/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. Some data suggest that paraaortic LND is associated with a survival benefit in women with intermediate or high-risk disease. This finding was reported in a retrospective cohort study of 671 women with endometrial carcinoma of all stages who underwent either pelvic LND or combined pelvic and paraaortic LND; median follow-up for both groups was approximately 7.5 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-pretreatment-evaluation-staging-and-surgical-treatment/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Eight-year disease-specific survival rates were significantly higher in the combined pelvic and paraaortic LND group compared with pelvic LND alone for women with intermediate or high-risk disease (84 versus 69 percent), but not for women with low-risk disease (94 versus 93 percent). In addition, it appears that the potential benefit associated with paraaortic LND increases with higher tumor grades. In a large series (n=1453) of women with endometrioid endometrial carcinoma, there were 10 paraaortic recurrences, distributed as follows: <span class=\"nowrap\">0/10</span> in grade 1 tumors; <span class=\"nowrap\">1/10</span> in grade 2; <span class=\"nowrap\">9/10</span> in grade 3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-pretreatment-evaluation-staging-and-surgical-treatment/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6649037\"><span class=\"h4\">Node sampling versus resection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lymph node sampling differs from lymphadenectomy in that the goal of sampling is to obtain a representative biopsy, while the intent of lymphadenectomy is to remove all node-bearing tissue in a specific anatomic distribution. When lymph node sampling is performed, data suggest that patients who underwent multiple site sampling had better survival compared to those who had limited site sampling, or no sampling at all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-pretreatment-evaluation-staging-and-surgical-treatment/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Based on this report, it would be reasonable to conclude that more accurate prognostic information may be obtained when nodes are dissected from several of the node chains draining the uterus. </p><p>Surgery limited to TAH-BSO with palpation of nodes with sampling of enlarged nodes for women with grade 1 or 2 disease that is presumed to be stage IA or B is advocated by some experts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-pretreatment-evaluation-staging-and-surgical-treatment/abstract/32,49-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,49-51</a>]. These women have a greater than 90 percent five-year survival rate following TAH-BSO alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-pretreatment-evaluation-staging-and-surgical-treatment/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>]. Of note, palpation or inspection has not been found to be a sensitive method for detecting metastases. This was illustrated in a classic report, in which fewer than 10 percent of node positive patients with endometrial carcinoma had grossly involved nodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-pretreatment-evaluation-staging-and-surgical-treatment/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. </p><p>This limited approach for presumed early stage disease is supported by data from two large randomized trials and a large retrospective cohort study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-pretreatment-evaluation-staging-and-surgical-treatment/abstract/32,49,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,49,54</a>]. The largest of these trials (n=1408), A Study in the Treatment of Endometrial carcinoma (ASTEC) trial, found no survival benefit of staging with versus without pelvic lymphadenectomy in women thought preoperatively to have stage I disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-pretreatment-evaluation-staging-and-surgical-treatment/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Of note, in the no lymphadenectomy group, suspicious nodes were removed.</p><p>However, this trial does not provide information regarding the usefulness of pelvic LND for guiding treatment after surgery since patients in the second phase of the trial were treated without taking into account lymph node status. In addition, since all patients underwent paraaortic node palpation and sampling, it does not address the benefit of paraaortic LND. The radiotherapy portion of this trial is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-low-risk-endometrial-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of low-risk endometrial cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Women who do not undergo at least sampling of pelvic and paraaortic lymph nodes at the time of surgery are incompletely surgically staged. </p><p>Some experts believe that lymph node sampling should be performed in all women with endometrial carcinoma, but not complete pelvic and paraaortic LND. When this approach is used, all clinically suspicious nodes are sampled, but in the absence of suspicious nodes, a representative (not random) sampling is performed. The benefit of this approach is that it gives information about nodal status while minimizing procedure-related morbidity. In particular, some experts believe that the morbidity associated with complete LND outweighs the benefits when the likelihood of nodal disease is very low, such as in low risk stage I disease. Lower extremity lymphedema and associated cellulitis are the primary posttreatment issues associated with pelvic and paraaortic LND. The reported risk of lymphedema varies widely (5 to 38 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-pretreatment-evaluation-staging-and-surgical-treatment/abstract/34,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,55</a>]. Risk of lymphedema appears to increase with the number of nodes removed (10 or more is associated with a risk of lymphedema of 3 to 10 percent) and with adjuvant radiation therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-pretreatment-evaluation-staging-and-surgical-treatment/abstract/34,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,55</a>].

Given the importance of lymph node involvement to staging and treatment decisions, lymph node assessment is best performed by experienced surgeons, such as gynecologic oncologists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-pretreatment-evaluation-staging-and-surgical-treatment/abstract/58-60\" class=\"abstract_t\">58-60</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1766958792\"><span class=\"h3\">Sentinel node biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sentinel lymph node biopsy for endometrial carcinoma has become more commonly performed, but its role is still not fully established. The National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines state that sentinel lymph node biopsy may be considered for the staging of apparent uterine-confined malignancy when there is no metastasis demonstrated by imaging studies or no obvious extrauterine disease at exploration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-pretreatment-evaluation-staging-and-surgical-treatment/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. </p><p>A study of over 28,000 women who underwent surgical staging for endometrial carcinoma from 2011 to 2015 reported that 32.9 percent had no nodal assessment, 62.3 percent had lymphadenectomy, and 4.8 percent had sentinel lymph node biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-pretreatment-evaluation-staging-and-surgical-treatment/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].

Successful mapping of at least one sentinel lymph node was achieved in 86 percent and the sensitivity of sentinel lymph node was 97.2 percent. </p><p>According to the sentinel lymph node hypothesis, tumor cells migrate from a primary tumor and colonize one or a few lymph nodes (ie, the sentinel lymph node) before involving other lymph nodes. Peritumoral injection of a dye or tracer permits identification of a sentinel lymph node in most patients, and its status accurately predicts the status of the remaining regional nodes.</p><p>The site of injection of the tracer for endometrial carcinoma is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-pretreatment-evaluation-staging-and-surgical-treatment/abstract/66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67</a>]. Studies have evaluated cervical, subserosal, and hysteroscopically-guided endometrial injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-pretreatment-evaluation-staging-and-surgical-treatment/abstract/68-72\" class=\"abstract_t\">68-72</a>]. The meta-analysis of 26 studies described above found that pericervical injection was associated with a significantly increased rate of detecting any sentinel node and that hysteroscopic injection was associated with a significantly decreased detection rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-pretreatment-evaluation-staging-and-surgical-treatment/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. </p><p>There is no consensus about the best surgical approach (open or laparoscopic) for sentinel lymph node biopsy or the utility of preoperative imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-pretreatment-evaluation-staging-and-surgical-treatment/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Further study is required to evaluate whether sentinel lymph node biopsy is clinically useful and, if so, the optimal site for tracer injection and the accuracy of lymphatic mapping in endometrial carcinoma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16620756\"><span class=\"h2\">Management of women with cervical involvement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Historically, it was thought that women with stage II endometrial carcinoma (tumor invades stromal connective tissue of the cervix but does not extend beyond uterus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F51307\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51307 \">table 1</a>)) had a high risk of parametrial involvement; this was based upon an assumption that endometrial carcinoma would follow a pattern of spread similar to cervical cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-pretreatment-evaluation-staging-and-surgical-treatment/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. Thus, these patients have been treated with radical hysterectomy at some institutions. However, it appears that lymphovascular space invasion is a better predictor of parametrial extension than cervical involvement. This was illustrated in the largest study, a retrospective series of 334 women with endometrial carcinoma who underwent radical hysterectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-pretreatment-evaluation-staging-and-surgical-treatment/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. Lymphovascular spread was present in all 28 women (8.4 percent) with parametrial spread. Most of these women (26 of 28) had lymphovascular space invasion in addition to one or more of the following findings: invasion of more than half the myometrial depth (19 women), cervical invasion (10), ovarian metastases (six), or pelvic or paraaortic lymph node metastases (19), or positive peritoneal cytology (13). Thus, for women with stage II endometrial carcinoma, we suggest performing a simple hysterectomy (extrafascial class I) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57850\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57850 \">table 4</a>) with lymphadenectomy rather than radical hysterectomy. The exceptions to this are women with gross cervical involvement in whom performing a simple hysterectomy would cut through the tumor (all gross disease should be removed) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> those in whom it is uncertain whether the primary is cervical or uterine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Cytoreduction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We suggest surgical cytoreduction in women who are found to have pelvic or intra-abdominal disease at exploration. Cytoreduction appears to confer a survival advantage to women with pelvic or intra-abdominal spread of endometrial cancer, but high quality data are lacking. The best available evidence is a meta-analysis of 14 retrospective case series that included 10 studies of primary disease and four studies of recurrent disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-pretreatment-evaluation-staging-and-surgical-treatment/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. A higher proportion of women with complete cytoreduction were found to be significantly associated with longer median survival. For women with primary disease, overall survival rates were: complete cytoreduction (30 to 51 percent) and optimal cytoreduction, defined in individual studies as &le;1 or &le;2 cm (15 to 51 percent). </p><p>Secondary cytoreduction is discussed in detail separately.

A meta-analysis of eight randomized trials with early-stage endometrial carcinoma compared staging with laparoscopy or laparotomy and found no effect on overall survival (three trials; 359 women; hazard ratio [HR] 1.14, 95% CI 0.62-2.10) or recurrence-free survival, but the analysis lacked sufficient statistical power to detect a difference in this outcome (four trials; 2975 women; HR 1.13, 95% CI 0.90-1.42) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-pretreatment-evaluation-staging-and-surgical-treatment/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of perioperative death, blood transfusion, or bladder, ureteric, bowel, or vascular injury. However, the rate of severe postoperative adverse events was lower in the laparoscopy group (relative risk 0.58, 95% CI 0.37-0.91). Laparoscopy resulted in less blood loss (mean difference, 106.82 mL less), and with longer operative duration and shorter hospital stay; however, no pooled analysis was done for the latter two outcomes. </p><p>A previous meta-analysis compared women with endometrial carcinoma who underwent complete surgical staging with laparoscopically assisted vaginal or total laparoscopic hysterectomy versus laparotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-pretreatment-evaluation-staging-and-surgical-treatment/abstract/68,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,79</a>]. Operative duration for laparoscopic procedures was longer (3.3 versus 2.2 hours), but resulted in fewer perioperative complications, decreased blood loss (267 mL less), and shorter hospital stays (three versus four days) and faster return to normal activity (28 versus 48 days). The number of pelvic and paraaortic lymph nodes resected was the same with both techniques. </p><p>A subsequent large, multinational randomized trial (n = 760) of women with stage I endometrioid endometrial carcinoma compared staging with total laparoscopic and total abdominal hysterectomy and found no difference in disease-free survival at 4.5 years (81.6 versus 81.3 percent) or overall survival (mortality: 7.4 versus 6.8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-pretreatment-evaluation-staging-and-surgical-treatment/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. This was the second largest trial to evaluate this question; a prior trial included 2616 women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-pretreatment-evaluation-staging-and-surgical-treatment/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>] and was included in the meta-analysis cited above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-pretreatment-evaluation-staging-and-surgical-treatment/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>].</p><p>In a case series from a single surgeon, the rate of conversion of laparoscopic endometrial carcinoma staging procedures to an open or vaginal approach in a series of 235 patients was three percent overall and seven percent in patients with a body mass index of 40 or higher [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-pretreatment-evaluation-staging-and-surgical-treatment/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. </p><p>An important potential limitation of laparoscopic endometrial carcinoma staging is the difficulty of using this technique to dissect the paraaortic nodes above the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA). A prospective series reported that 77 percent of patients with paraaortic nodal metastases have disease above the IMA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-pretreatment-evaluation-staging-and-surgical-treatment/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. As noted above, some experts extend the paraaortic LND superiorly to the level of the renal veins. To reach this level laparoscopically requires advanced skills, and possibly, special techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-pretreatment-evaluation-staging-and-surgical-treatment/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>Laparoscopic staging of endometrial carcinoma should only be performed by a surgeon with experience in laparoscopic hysterectomy and lymph node sampling. To minimize potential seeding of cancer cells of the peritoneal cavity, vaginal cuff, and port site during laparoscopic staging, some surgeons perform bilateral tubal coagulation as the first surgical step and also avoid use of uterine manipulators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-pretreatment-evaluation-staging-and-surgical-treatment/abstract/69,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">69,70</a>]. Because of these concerns, uterine morcellation typically is avoided; if the uterus is too large to remove vaginally, then an abdominal hysterectomy is preferred.

The advantages of robotic procedures were mainly in comparison with laparotomy. Blood loss was significantly lower with robotic surgery than laparotomy (an average of 186 mL less) and conventional laparoscopy (an average of 86 mL less, a difference that is unlikely be clinically significant). The rate of transfusion was not significantly reduced compared with either laparotomy (OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.1-1.2) or conventional laparoscopy (OR 0.5, 95% CI 0.1&ndash;2.2), but the study was underpowered to detect significant improvements of this magnitude. The rate of wound and other complications (stroke, ileus, lymphedema, nerve palsy, acute renal failure, lymphocyst, urinary retention) were significantly reduced for robotic surgery compared with laparotomy (wound: OR 0.1, 95%CI 0.04&ndash;0.4 and other complications: OR 0.3, 95% CI 0.1&ndash;0.6), but not conventional laparoscopy. The primary disadvantage of robotic procedures was longer operative duration (an average of 89 minutes longer than laparotomy). </p><p>Regarding LESS, use for surgical staging and lymphadenectomy for gynecologic cancers has been reported. As an example, 13 of 15 women with endometrial carcinoma and five of six women with ovarian cancer were staged with lymphadenectomy, when appropriate, using a LESS approach; the remaining procedures were converted to conventional laparoscopy or laparotomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-pretreatment-evaluation-staging-and-surgical-treatment/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. Median operative duration was 2.2 hours. </p><p>Another series evaluated use of LESS for staging of gynecologic malignancies with pelvic and paraaortic lymph node dissection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-pretreatment-evaluation-staging-and-surgical-treatment/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. Successful procedures were reported in 20 of 21 patients with a mean operative duration of 2.0 hours. Median pelvic and paraaortic node counts were 14 (range 7 to 19) and 6 (range 2 to 14), respectively. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Vaginal hysterectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vaginal hysterectomy is not recommended, in general, for endometrial carcinoma staging since it precludes examination of the abdomen and lymph nodes for metastases. However, this surgical approach may be appropriate for women who are poor candidates for major abdominal surgery (eg, obesity, medical comorbidities). In these populations, retrospective series have reported that vaginal hysterectomy is associated with a low rate of perioperative complications and 5 to 10 year disease-specific survival rates of 80 percent or higher [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endometrial-carcinoma-pretreatment-evaluation-staging-and-surgical-treatment/abstract/87,88\" class=\"abstract_t\">87,88</a>]. However, since stage is uncertain in these women, it is not possible to compare these data with survival rates for other women.</p><p>In women who undergo vaginal hysterectomy, BSO should also be performed.
