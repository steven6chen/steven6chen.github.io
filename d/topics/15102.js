The irAEs result from damage that occurs due to immune activation and inflammation induced by these drugs and can affect nearly every organ system.</p><p>This class of drugs works by blocking inhibitory molecules on T cells, antigen-presenting cells, and tumors, thus allowing an enhanced endogenous T-cell-mediated immune response to cancer. The efficacy of ICIs was first demonstrated in metastatic melanoma, but many indications have since been approved, including non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, and other advanced malignancies (see specific disease-related topic reviews). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-cancer-immunotherapy#H28828766\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of cancer immunotherapy&quot;, section on 'Checkpoint inhibitors'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunotherapy-of-advanced-melanoma-with-immune-checkpoint-inhibition\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunotherapy of advanced melanoma with immune checkpoint inhibition&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunotherapy-of-non-small-cell-lung-cancer-with-immune-checkpoint-inhibition\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunotherapy of non-small cell lung cancer with immune checkpoint inhibition&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunotherapy-of-renal-cell-carcinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunotherapy of renal cell carcinoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-relapsed-or-refractory-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma#H903423360\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of relapsed or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Targeted chemotherapy and immunotherapy'</a>.)</p><p>The rheumatologic complications of ICIs and their management will be reviewed here. The range of irAEs with non-rheumatologic manifestations (eg, colitis, endocrine disease, and others) and rheumatic disorders occurring due to other types of cancer treatment are described in detail separately.

Normally, when a T cell is activated, multiple mechanisms control the level of activation both centrally and peripherally [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatologic-complications-of-checkpoint-inhibitor-immunotherapy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Two main interactions that control T-cell activation are cytotoxic lymphocyte antigen protein 4 (CTLA-4, also called CD152) on T cells binding with <span class=\"nowrap\">CD80/86</span> (also called B7-1 and B7-2) on antigen-presenting cells, and programmed cell death receptor 1 (PD-1) binding to programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1, also known as B7-H1) or programmed cell death ligand 2 (PD-L2 [B7-H2]) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-cancer-immunotherapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of cancer immunotherapy&quot;</a>). By blocking these inhibitory pathways, checkpoint inhibitors allow for increased activation of T cells and a greater immune response against tumors.</p><p>The first approved ICI, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipilimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ipilimumab</a>, blocks the binding of CTLA-4 to its ligands <span class=\"nowrap\">CD80/86</span>. Subsequent ICIs have targeted PD-1 (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=pembrolizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pembrolizumab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nivolumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nivolumab</a>) or PD-L1 (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atezolizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atezolizumab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=avelumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">avelumab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=durvalumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">durvalumab</a>) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F115900\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115900 \">figure 1</a>).

Clinical manifestations of irAEs are diverse with respect to the organ systems involved, severity, and temporal relationship to ICI therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatologic-complications-of-checkpoint-inhibitor-immunotherapy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The specific immune pathways that are relevant for the pathogenesis of particular irAEs are still under investigation. There are no published correlative data for the pathogenesis of rheumatologic irAEs, but there are some data from other types of irAEs. In colitis, levels of interleukin (IL)-17 were correlated with more severe disease, suggesting a role for this cytokine and the T-helper 17 (Th17) cell response in pathogenesis. Histology from multiple affected organs has shown diverse inflammatory infiltrates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatologic-complications-of-checkpoint-inhibitor-immunotherapy/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The immune checkpoints targeted by ICIs are relevant for classic rheumatologic diseases, suggesting a possible overlap in mechanism. As an example, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abatacept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abatacept</a>, a fusion protein of the extracellular domain of cytotoxic lymphocyte antigen protein 4 (CTLA-4) and the Fc portion of immunoglobulin (Ig)G, has been an effective treatment for inflammatory arthritis, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA), juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), and psoriatic arthritis. Its mechanism can be thought of as the converse of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ipilimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ipilimumab</a> in that it blocks the activating interaction between CD28 and <span class=\"nowrap\">CD80/86,</span> rather than blocking the inhibitory interaction.</p><p>CTLA-4 and other immune checkpoint molecules have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatologic-complications-of-checkpoint-inhibitor-immunotherapy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Programmed cell death receptor 1 (PD-1) may be important to RA pathogenesis, as indicated by some mouse and human studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatologic-complications-of-checkpoint-inhibitor-immunotherapy/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H580950061\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rheumatologic immune-related adverse events (irAEs) have been less consistently reported in the published literature than other types of irAEs, and estimates vary substantially; in one systematic review, the rate of arthralgia in clinical trials of checkpoint inhibitors ranged from 1 to 43 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatologic-complications-of-checkpoint-inhibitor-immunotherapy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The known or suspected rheumatologic irAEs include inflammatory arthritis, sicca syndrome, inflammatory myopathy, vasculitis (including giant cell [temporal] arteritis [GCA] and single-organ vasculitis), polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), eosinophilic fasciitis, sarcoidosis, digital ischemia, and systemic sclerosis (scleroderma) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatologic-complications-of-checkpoint-inhibitor-immunotherapy/abstract/7-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-23</a>].</p><p>Reasons for the variation and sometimes very low frequency of reports are not entirely clear but may be related to a lack of recognition of musculoskeletal symptoms by treating providers or the fact that rheumatologic irAEs are almost never life-threatening and are thus not often graded as severe.</p><p>How commonly arthralgia actually represents a true inflammatory arthritis is also unclear. In oncology clinical trials, including those using ICIs, there are multiple ways in which a given clinical finding or symptom can be coded for data collection (eg, joint effusion, arthralgia, arthritis), making it difficult to identify a true association. For other rheumatologic irAEs, epidemiologic data are even more limited. Dry mouth or dry eyes were reported in 3 to 24 percent of patients in those trials, while myalgia was present in 2 to 21 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatologic-complications-of-checkpoint-inhibitor-immunotherapy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Myositis and vasculitis were not consistently reported in the published clinical trials, and most information concerning these entities is from case reports.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H197358105\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF EVALUATION AND MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical spectrum of rheumatologic immune-related adverse events (irAEs) with exposure to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) ranges widely, with presentations mirroring many classic rheumatologic diseases, although some characteristic features may be lacking, depending upon the syndrome and individual patient. It is common for patients with rheumatologic irAEs to have other non-rheumatologic irAEs; thus, obtaining a detailed history and performing a thorough physical examination are important, regardless of the presentation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=toxicities-associated-with-checkpoint-inhibitor-immunotherapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Toxicities associated with checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In patients with one of these syndromes, the severity of the irAE, future plans for cancer therapy, status of the tumor response to ICIs, and patient and oncologist preference must all be considered in deciding on treatment for rheumatologic irAEs. We discuss treatment options with both the patient and referring oncologist before determining the specific plan of action.</p><p>The clinical need and the relative risks and benefits of rheumatologic and oncologic treatment options influence the management approach. As examples, certain medications like <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a> or low-dose glucocorticoids may be used concurrently with ICI therapy and may be beneficial in patients with mild arthritis, while use of others, particularly those that interfere with T-cell function or the biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) that may be needed in patients with severe inflammatory arthritis, have not often been used concurrently with ICIs, though there are reports of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tocilizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tocilizumab</a> use in patients actively receiving ICIs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatologic-complications-of-checkpoint-inhibitor-immunotherapy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Close consultation with the patient's oncologist is important in deciding whether to continue or discontinue ICI therapy and the most appropriate interventions in a given patient.</p><p>Treatment approaches are based upon case reports and case series, but clinical trials have not been performed to compare treatment options. Our approaches are similar to those proposed by professional societies. (See <a href=\"#H2627495689\" class=\"local\">'Guidelines of major organizations'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1584415326\"><span class=\"h1\">INFLAMMATORY ARTHRITIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3230708120\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations and diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inflammatory arthritis, with joint pain, tenderness, swelling, and warmth, has been the most commonly reported rheumatologic immune-related adverse event (irAE) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatologic-complications-of-checkpoint-inhibitor-immunotherapy/abstract/9,18,19,23,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,18,19,23,25</a>]. The arthritis can develop at almost any time during immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy, from two weeks to over a year from ICI initiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatologic-complications-of-checkpoint-inhibitor-immunotherapy/abstract/9,18,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,18,23</a>]. Symptoms and findings can be protracted in some patients. Several different clinical presentations of inflammatory arthritis with different patterns of joint involvement and ranging from mild to severe have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatologic-complications-of-checkpoint-inhibitor-immunotherapy/abstract/9,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,18</a>]; joint damage with erosions can occur within months of developing symptoms in a subset of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatologic-complications-of-checkpoint-inhibitor-immunotherapy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. These presentations have included:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Small-joint polyarthritis, sometimes in a pattern similar to rheumatoid arthritis (RA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatologic-complications-of-checkpoint-inhibitor-immunotherapy/abstract/9,18,23,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,18,23,25</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Larger joint oligoarthritis with or without inflammatory back pain, including a pattern similar to reactive arthritis (ie, a large-joint, lower-extremity predominant arthritis with sterile urethritis and conjunctivitis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatologic-complications-of-checkpoint-inhibitor-immunotherapy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>New-onset psoriatic arthritis, which has been reported in a patient on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nivolumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nivolumab</a> with a family history of psoriasis, though no personal history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatologic-complications-of-checkpoint-inhibitor-immunotherapy/abstract/20,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,23</a>]</p><p/><p>The diagnosis is primarily made clinically, based upon the history and physical examination of a new-onset arthritis following the initiation of an ICI. A detailed history should be obtained to help determine if any features of arthritis or potentially associated features like skin psoriasis were present before the ICI was started. An inflammatory arthritis should be present on physical examination, and the pattern of involvement should be characterized. In patients without preceding symptoms and the absence of features to suggest a classic form of inflammatory arthritis, a diagnosis of ICI-induced arthritis can be made.</p><p>Laboratory studies can be helpful but are not critical for diagnosis. Most patients have been seronegative for rheumatoid factor (RF) and cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP), but a group of seropositive patients has also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatologic-complications-of-checkpoint-inhibitor-immunotherapy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. An elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) may be present, although the utility of these markers to identify inflammatory arthritis is compromised by the comorbid malignancy, which may also affect the ESR and CRP.</p><p>Plain radiographs of affected joints should be obtained at the time of the initial evaluation for arthritis but are less sensitive for early changes, as in other forms of inflammatory arthritis; however, these also serve as a baseline for comparison with later studies. Imaging with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound has shown synovitis, tenosynovitis, and bony erosive disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatologic-complications-of-checkpoint-inhibitor-immunotherapy/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. These findings may be helpful in distinguishing inflammation and synovitis from noninflammatory pain in patients in whom that determination remains uncertain.</p><p>Other conditions that may mimic ICI-related inflammatory arthritis should be included in the differential diagnosis.

Treatment should be individualized based upon the clinical findings and severity of the symptoms and findings related to the arthritis, as well as the need to optimize antineoplastic therapy; treatment recommendations and decisions should be made in close collaboration with the patient's oncologist. (See <a href=\"#H197358105\" class=\"local\">'General principles of evaluation and management'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1651867449\"><span class=\"h3\">Initial treatment of mild arthritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with mild forms of arthritis (without significant functional compromise), we suggest a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) or low-dose glucocorticoids. ICI therapy is usually continued in such patients.</p><p>Oral NSAIDs (eg, orally administered <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a> 375 to 500 mg twice daily, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a> 600 to 800 mg three times daily) are typically used, but some patients with very mild disease may benefit adequately from a topical NSAID (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diclofenac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diclofenac</a> gel). There is no evidence to indicate a preference for any specific NSAID. The drug should be used in the lowest dose necessary once a response is achieved and for the shortest duration needed. Comorbidities and relative contraindications to NSAID use, such as renal, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal (GI) disease, as well as advanced age, should be considered in the treatment decision, and patients should be monitored appropriately and with particular attention to GI symptoms, given the frequency of GI adverse effects with ICI therapy, including diarrhea and, less often, colitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonselective-nsaids-overview-of-adverse-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonselective NSAIDs: Overview of adverse effects&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=toxicities-associated-with-checkpoint-inhibitor-immunotherapy#H645573\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Toxicities associated with checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy&quot;, section on 'Diarrhea/colitis'</a>.)</p><p>In patients in whom NSAIDs should be avoided, or in whom a more rapid response is desired than expected with an NSAID, we use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (initially 10 to 20 mg daily), then assess the response after one to two weeks, adjusting the dose to minimize glucocorticoid exposure while controlling disease symptoms and findings.

Four of the seven patients with RA had flares, which were managed by glucocorticoids alone for all.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another series of 52 patients with preexisting autoimmune disease treated with programmed cell death receptor 1 (PD-1) inhibitors, nearly 40 percent had a flare of their autoimmune disease, but only two patients discontinued the checkpoint inhibitor due to the flares [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/rheumatologic-complications-of-checkpoint-inhibitor-immunotherapy/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In this study of anti-PD-1-treated patients, 7 out of 13 patients with RA had a flare requiring immunosuppression, while two out of two with Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome, three out of three with polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), and three out of eight with psoriasis required treatment. Of those in this study who had a flare of their autoimmune disease, eight had to temporarily interrupt the ICI treatment, and two had to permanently discontinue the ICI.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H37642494\"><span class=\"h2\">Maintenance treatment while on immune checkpoint inhibitors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with established rheumatic diseases should continue to be monitored closely by their treating rheumatologist when starting and continuing therapy with an ICI.

Precise epidemiology is unknown, but inflammatory arthritis appears to be the most common clinical presentation seen by rheumatologists. It is also common for patients with rheumatologic irAEs to have other non-rheumatologic irAEs. (See <a href=\"#H2855374222\" class=\"local\">'Immune checkpoint inhibitor mechanism of action'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3841094854\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis of rheumatologic complications'</a> above and <a href=\"#H580950061\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with a rheumatologic irAE, the severity of the irAE, future plans for cancer therapy, status of the tumor response to ICIs, the relative risks and benefits of rheumatologic and oncologic treatment options, and patient and oncologist preference must all be considered in determining the management approach. (See <a href=\"#H197358105\" class=\"local\">'General principles of evaluation and management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inflammatory arthritis can develop at almost any time during ICI therapy, and several different patterns of joint involvement and disease ranging from mild to severe have been reported; rheumatoid factor and anti-citrullinated peptide antibodies are often absent. (See <a href=\"#H3230708120\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations and diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with inflammatory arthritis, we take the following approach to treatment (see <a href=\"#H2859988928\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In patients with mild arthritis (without significant functional compromise), we suggest a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) or low-dose glucocorticoids. ICI therapy is usually continued in such patients. Oral NSAIDs (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a> 375 to 500 mg twice daily, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a> 600 to 800 mg three times daily) are typically used. In patients in whom NSAIDs should be avoided, or a more rapid response is desired than expected with an NSAID, we prefer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (initially 10 to 20 mg daily). In patients with only a few joints involved, we administer intraarticular glucocorticoid injections in affected joints, if feasible, which may reduce the need for other interventions. (See <a href=\"#H1651867449\" class=\"local\">'Initial treatment of mild arthritis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In patients with moderate or severe arthritis, with involvement of multiple joints and impairment of function, we suggest moderate- to high-dose oral glucocorticoids (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> 40 mg daily up to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> daily); higher doses are sometimes required. In patients who require these higher doses of glucocorticoids (eg, over 20 mg daily of prednisone or equivalent), the ICI is sometimes held temporarily until the prednisone can be tapered to a lower dose and the patient is doing well. (See <a href=\"#H3626402111\" class=\"local\">'Initial treatment of moderate or severe arthritis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In patients with mild to moderate, but persistent, inflammatory arthritis who cannot be weaned to a low dose (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> less than 7.5 to 10 mg daily) or entirely off glucocorticoids we suggest a conventional synthetic disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD), such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sulfasalazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sulfasalazine</a> (SSZ), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxychloroquine</a> (HCQ), or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (MTX) as used in RA. The decisions of whether the ICI can or should be held needs to be made on an individual basis together with the treating oncologist, especially in cases where glucocorticoids cannot be tapered. (See <a href=\"#H439266957\" class=\"local\">'Unable to adequately taper glucocorticoids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In selected patients with severe arthritis who are refractory to glucocorticoid therapy or unable to wean to low-dose glucocorticoids (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> less than 7.5 to 10 mg daily), we use a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitor. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tocilizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Tocilizumab</a> and other agents have also been used in such patients. Based upon the mechanism of action of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abatacept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abatacept</a>, we avoid its use in the treatment of irAEs, particularly in patients treated with anti-CTLA-4 ICIs. (See <a href=\"#H2214766023\" class=\"local\">'Severe arthritis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3547628272\" class=\"local\">'Other agents'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Salivary hypofunction and keratoconjunctivitis sicca resembling Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome have been reported in patients treated with ICIs. In many patients, the dry mouth symptoms have been predominant without concomitant dry eyes; parotid swelling has been rare. Most patients lack the autoantibodies to <span class=\"nowrap\">Ro/SSA</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">La/SSB</span>. The treatment approach is similar to that for Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome without ICI exposure. (See <a href=\"#H1718391220\" class=\"local\">'Sicca syndrome/other ocular disorders'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) may occur in isolation or with giant cell (temporal) arteritis (GCA) during ICI treatment; as with usual <span class=\"nowrap\">PMR/GCA,</span> patients with ICI-induced disease have been older adults. Other conditions seen include inflammatory myositis and several less common conditions. (See <a href=\"#H87812179\" class=\"local\">'Polymyalgia rheumatica/giant cell (temporal) arteritis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H590438825\" class=\"local\">'Inflammatory myopathies'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3924203986\" class=\"local\">'Others'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with preexisting autoimmune disease have been treated successfully with ICIs, but a significant proportion can have an exacerbation of their underlying autoimmune disease. For this reason, they should continue to be monitored by their treating rheumatologist.
