Infection with these organisms can occur in patients with or without HIV infection. The two principal forms of MAC infection in patients with HIV are disseminated disease and focal lymphadenitis. By contrast, isolated pulmonary infection is typically seen in immunocompetent patients. </p><p>Among HIV-infected patients, MAC infection is most commonly seen among those with a CD4 count &lt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span>. Dramatic declines in the rate of new MAC cases accompanied the use of prophylaxis against MAC infection early in the epidemic, and more recently, the widespread use of effective antiretroviral therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycobacterium-avium-complex-mac-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>The epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of MAC infection in HIV disease will be reviewed here. MAC infections in patients without HIV are discussed separately.

MAC organisms are ubiquitous in the environment, including water and soil [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycobacterium-avium-complex-mac-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology of nontuberculous mycobacterial infections&quot;, section on 'Mycobacterium avium complex'</a>.)</p><p>There is no need for isolation of hospitalized patients with MAC infection since person-to-person or common source transmission of MAC appears to be rare. In one report that evaluated 32 patients with AIDS and MAC from a daycare center in France over a 13-month period, the strains of organisms were heterogeneous by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycobacterium-avium-complex-mac-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Another series of 130 isolates from children, both HIV-infected and not infected, also failed to show a clonal origin for the strains, although HIV-infected children were more commonly infected with <em>M. avium</em> than controls (88 versus 38 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycobacterium-avium-complex-mac-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of MAC infection in patients with HIV increases as the CD4 count declines below 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span>. The risk does not appear to vary by gender, ethnicity, or route of transmission. </p><p>However, the risk may be different depending upon the geographic location. As an example, in one study rates of MAC disease were higher in the southern than in the northern United States and Canada (22 versus 14 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycobacterium-avium-complex-mac-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In addition, MAC infection has been reported to be more common in HIV-infected patients in the United States than in Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycobacterium-avium-complex-mac-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p>One international study found significantly higher rates of disseminated MAC in developed compared with developing countries (10 to 22 percent versus 2 to 3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycobacterium-avium-complex-mac-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In this study, risk factors for disseminated disease in the United States and Finland included:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low CD4 count</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of an indoor pool for swimming</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Previous bronchoscopy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Repeated consumption of raw or partially cooked fish or shellfish</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Therapy with granulocyte stimulating factor.</p><p/><p>Patients with disseminated MAC may also have a genetic predisposition to infection. In a nested case-control study from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort that compared 176 patients who had disseminated MAC with 176 matched controls, specific human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II alleles (DRB1, DQB, DM) were more commonly found in association with disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycobacterium-avium-complex-mac-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1732200261\"><span class=\"h2\">Effect on HIV infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The impact of MAC infection on HIV disease has been explored. In the era prior to the use of potent antiretroviral therapy (ART), a case-control study found a small, but significant increase in HIV RNA levels in patients with MAC bacteremia compared with controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycobacterium-avium-complex-mac-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. A mean increase of 0.4 log 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> was documented in cases compared with control patients matched for CD4 counts, prophylaxis against MAC, ART, and duration of follow-up. </p><p>It is well established that MAC disease was associated with a shortened survival in patients with AIDS prior to the era of potent ART. In one study, a diagnosis of MAC was associated with a threefold increased risk of death, independent of CD4 count [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycobacterium-avium-complex-mac-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The increased mortality may be explained by upregulation of HIV RNA or by direct effects of MAC infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycobacterium-avium-complex-mac-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p>Additional information on the interaction of MAC and HIV are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unlike some other opportunistic infections in patients with AIDS, <em>Mycobacterium avium</em> complex (MAC) infection is thought to result from recent acquisition rather than reactivation, since latent infection does not exist with this organism. The portals of entry for the organism appear to be the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract with bacteremia following dissemination via the lymphatics. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Transmission'</a> above.)</p><p>Virulence factors for MAC have not been established. One study suggested that differential virulence among strains, as assessed by cell invasion or macrophage replication assays, varies among colonizing strains as compared with those associated with disseminated disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycobacterium-avium-complex-mac-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The mechanisms of interaction among MAC, HIV-1 virus, and the immune system are also incompletely understood. In one study, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha levels were increased and the HIV macrophage-tropic receptor, CCR5, was upregulated by monocytes exposed in vitro to MAC organisms or antigens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycobacterium-avium-complex-mac-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The expression of the T cell-tropic receptor, CXCR4, was not affected. HIV-1 production was also increased in macrophage tissue culture cells previously exposed to MAC antigens. In lymph node tissue coinfected with MAC and HIV-1, increased levels of CCR5 were demonstrated in comparison to lymph nodes infected with HIV-1 alone.</p><p>Receipt of granulocyte stimulating factor was identified as a possible epidemiologic risk factor for disseminated MAC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycobacterium-avium-complex-mac-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, in one in vitro study, neutrophils harvested from AIDS patients treated with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) produced enhanced killing of <em>M. avium</em> compared with cells from patients treated with G-CSF plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifabutin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifabutin</a> or rifabutin alone (90 versus 59 and 11 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycobacterium-avium-complex-mac-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The two principal forms of <em>Mycobacterium avium</em> complex (MAC) infection in HIV are disseminated and localized disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycobacterium-avium-complex-mac-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Isolated pulmonary infection is typically seen in immunocompetent patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-nontuberculous-mycobacterial-infections-in-hiv-negative-patients#H407656780\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of nontuberculous mycobacterial infections in HIV-negative patients&quot;, section on 'Pulmonary disease'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Disseminated infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to the widespread use of potent antiretroviral therapy (ART), MAC most commonly presented as disseminated disease. Symptoms of disseminated MAC are generally nonspecific and include fever, night sweats, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. In one series of nine patients, fever &ge;39&ordm;C was found in 78 percent, weight loss in 100 percent, cough in 78 percent, and diarrhea in 44 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycobacterium-avium-complex-mac-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. While lymphadenopathy can occur in disseminated disease, it is more likely to be diffuse and less noticeable than in localized disease. (See <a href=\"#H2864155667\" class=\"local\">'Lymphadenitis'</a> below.)</p><p>Laboratory abnormalities in disseminated infection frequently include anemia and elevated alkaline phosphatase and lactate dehydrogenase. The diagnosis is typically confirmed by the isolation of MAC from the blood. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Localized disease</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2864155667\"><span class=\"h3\">Lymphadenitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms of localized adenitis include fever, leukocytosis, and focal inflammation in a lymph node (eg, cervical, intraabdominal, mediastinal). In patients with HIV infection, most cases of MAC lymphadenitis result from an immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycobacterium-avium-complex-mac-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-reconstitution-inflammatory-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Case series suggest that focal inflammatory lymphadenitis develops approximately four weeks after ART is initiated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycobacterium-avium-complex-mac-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/18,20-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,20-24</a>]. MAC lymphadenitis due to IRIS can present in patients without a prior diagnosis of MAC (the &quot;unmasking&quot; form), or can develop in those with previously diagnosed disseminated infection. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Disseminated infection'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H486291650\"><span class=\"h3\">Uncommon manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unusual presentations of localized MAC infection have been reported in the era of potent ART. As an example, spinal MAC has been described in patients with a more prolonged response to ART after having a nadir CD4 count &lt;50 <span class=\"nowrap\">cell/microL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycobacterium-avium-complex-mac-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/20,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,25</a>]. Other unusual manifestations include mastitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycobacterium-avium-complex-mac-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], necrotic subcutaneous nodules, osteomyelitis, bursitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycobacterium-avium-complex-mac-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], granulomatous hepatitis, paravertebral abscesses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycobacterium-avium-complex-mac-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], brain abscess [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycobacterium-avium-complex-mac-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], worsening lung infiltrates, and diffuse intestinal involvement presenting with abdominal pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycobacterium-avium-complex-mac-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1227648273\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiographic imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abdominal computed tomography (CT) is a valuable part of the initial diagnostic evaluation in patients with suspected localized disease. Such patients typically demonstrate <span class=\"nowrap\">mesenteric/abdominal</span> lymph node enlargement. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Localized disease'</a> above.)</p><p>CT imaging may also be helpful in the diagnostic evaluation of disseminated disease. Findings supportive of disseminated infection include lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> small bowel thickening. However, one retrospective study of 24 patients with AIDS and positive blood cultures for <em>Mycobacterium avium</em> complex (MAC) found this test to be relatively insensitive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycobacterium-avium-complex-mac-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, and splenomegaly were found in 42, 50, and 46 percent, respectively, and thickening of the small bowel wall was observed in only 14 percent of the scans. Most notably, the CT was normal in 25 percent of the patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3310501015\"><span class=\"h2\">Identifying the organism</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Disseminated disease</strong> &ndash; The diagnosis of MAC is typically made by isolation of the organism in culture, usually of the blood or lymph node. When the BACTEC culture system is used, the cultures usually become positive in 7 to 10 days. Species identification using DNA probes distinguishes MAC from <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Bone marrow culture can also yield the organism, sometimes before blood cultures turn positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycobacterium-avium-complex-mac-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. The organism can also be cultured from a liver biopsy specimen. However, blood cultures are usually the preferred initial diagnostic test as they are less invasive. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There is a limited role in obtaining cultures of respiratory secretions or stool to diagnose MAC. A prospective study documented that colonization of the respiratory and gastrointestinal tract had a sensitivity of approximately 20 percent and a positive predictive value of about 60 percent for detecting disseminated disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycobacterium-avium-complex-mac-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Localized disease</strong> &ndash; Blood cultures are almost always sterile in patients with localized disease. Thus, the diagnosis is usually confirmed by culture of a tissue aspirate, typically a lymph node. However, in some cases (eg, those already on MAC treatment), the culture may be negative. In this setting, histologic evaluation reveals well-formed granulomas with relatively few visible organisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycobacterium-avium-complex-mac-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with AIDS, treatment of <em>Mycobacterium avium</em> complex (MAC) infection involves combination antimicrobial therapy. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Antimicrobial regimen'</a> below.) </p><p>In addition, antiretroviral therapy (ART) should be initiated or modified to suppress viremia. The timing of ART initiation in those who are treatment na&iuml;ve is discussed below.

(See <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Duration of MAC therapy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Susceptibility testing should be performed on all MAC isolates. However, antimicrobial therapy should not be delayed pending these results. If resistance to macrolides is detected, the regimen can be modified.

In a study of 154 patients with AIDS and MAC bacteremia treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clarithromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clarithromycin</a> monotherapy, resistance emerged in 46 percent at a median of 16 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/mycobacterium-avium-complex-mac-infections-in-hiv-infected-patients/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].
