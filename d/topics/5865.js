Fertility clearly declines with advancing age, especially after the mid-30s, and women who conceive are at greater risk of pregnancy complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-advanced-maternal-age-on-pregnancy/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. However, studies have generally observed that most women over 45 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-advanced-maternal-age-on-pregnancy/abstract/5-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-10</a>] or over 50 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-advanced-maternal-age-on-pregnancy/abstract/1-3,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3,11</a>] have good pregnancy outcomes and are able to cope with the physical and emotional stresses of pregnancy and parenting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-advanced-maternal-age-on-pregnancy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p>The effects of a woman's age on pregnancy will be reviewed here.

In 2014, 9 percent of first births in the United States were to women &ge;35 years of age, which is a 23 percent increase from 2000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-advanced-maternal-age-on-pregnancy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Additionally, the mean age at first birth increased by nearly five years between 1970 and 2014, from 21.4 to 26.3 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-advanced-maternal-age-on-pregnancy/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. The mean age of first-time mothers in other developed countries has increased as well: Canada (mean age 29.6 years), Sweden (mean age 28.3 years), and the Netherlands (28.7 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-advanced-maternal-age-on-pregnancy/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p>The increased occurrence of births at older maternal ages is due to the increased population of women aged 35 to 45, as well as later marriage, second marriage, the availability of better contraceptive options, and wider opportunities for further education and career advancement. Maternal education is one of the strongest predictors of use of contraception, timing of childbearing, and the total number of children a woman will bear. College educated women tend to have low first birth rates when in their 20s, but higher first birth rates in their 30s, thus illustrating the trend of delayed childbearing related to educational achievement and career opportunities. In surveys, women have cited a desire to achieve career, educational, financial, and personal goals, as well as stability in a marital relationship, before planning pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-advanced-maternal-age-on-pregnancy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. &#160;</p><p>However, older women also have a high prevalence of contraceptive nonuse resulting in unintended pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-advanced-maternal-age-on-pregnancy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Although women under age 25 have the highest rate of unintended pregnancy, women &ge;35 years have the highest proportion of unintended pregnancies ending in abortion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-advanced-maternal-age-on-pregnancy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">EARLY PREGNANCY ISSUES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Older women are at risk for the same pregnancy complications as younger women, but their risk is higher for some of these problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Spontaneous abortion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Older women experience an increased rate of spontaneous abortion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F81823\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81823 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-advanced-maternal-age-on-pregnancy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. These losses are both trisomic and euploid and primarily result from a decline in oocyte quality; changes in uterine and hormonal function may also play a role. The vast majority of losses occur between 6 and 14 weeks of gestation.</p><p>In a large, well-documented series from Scandinavia, the overall rate of spontaneous abortion managed in a hospital was approximately 11 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-advanced-maternal-age-on-pregnancy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Assuming that only 80 percent of women with abortions were hospitalized, the calculated risk of spontaneous loss in each age group was: &lt;30 years of age (12 percent), 30 to 34 years (15 percent), 35 to 39 years (25 percent), 40 to 44 years (51 percent), and &ge;45 years (93 percent) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F70032\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70032 \">table 1</a>). The influence of maternal age on the spontaneous abortion rate was independent of parity and history of previous abortion, although these characteristics were also risk factors for pregnancy loss.</p><p>The First and Second Trimester Evaluation of Risk (FASTER) trial, which was designed to assess Down syndrome risk, also reported pregnancy outcomes for over 36,000 pregnancies according to maternal age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-advanced-maternal-age-on-pregnancy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Strengths of this series include its large size, complete medical records, and unselected population; however, women were enrolled at 10 to 14 weeks of gestation so abortions in very early pregnancy, the most common time for pregnancy loss, were excluded. Women with fetuses who had large cystic hygromas were also excluded; these women were also at high risk of spontaneous loss. The rates of spontaneous abortion after 10 weeks of gestation for women &lt;35 years, 35 to 39 years, and &ge;40 years were 0.8, 1.5, and 2.2 percent, respectively.</p><p>The risk of eventual spontaneous abortion in women of advanced age is significant despite demonstration of fetal cardiac activity by transvaginal ultrasound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-advanced-maternal-age-on-pregnancy/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. As an example, in one study of over 148,000 ART pregnancies, the pregnancy loss rate after demonstrated fetal cardiac activity at 7 weeks according to maternal age was: &lt;33 years (9.9 percent), 33 to 34 years (11.4 percent), 35 to 37 years (13.7 percent), 38 to 40 years (19.8 percent), 41 to 42 years (29.9 percent), and &gt;42 years (36.6 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-advanced-maternal-age-on-pregnancy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. This shows that the increased rate of pregnancy loss was not confined to blighted ova.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Ectopic pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ectopic pregnancy is a major source of maternal mortality and morbidity in early pregnancy. Maternal age &ge;35 years is associated with a four- to eight-fold increased risk of ectopic pregnancy compared with younger women (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F70032\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70032 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-advanced-maternal-age-on-pregnancy/abstract/21,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,26</a>]. This high risk of ectopic pregnancy likely reflects an accumulation of risk factors over time, such as multiple sexual partners, pelvic infection, and tubal pathology. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ectopic-pregnancy-epidemiology-risk-factors-and-anatomic-sites\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ectopic pregnancy: Epidemiology, risk factors, and anatomic sites&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Chromosomal abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Karyotype analysis from spontaneous abortions, pregnancy terminations, genetic amniocenteses, and live born and stillborn infants shows a steady increase in the risk of aneuploidy as a woman ages (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F75423\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75423 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F81354\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81354 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F50590\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50590 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-advanced-maternal-age-on-pregnancy/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. The most common aneuploidy is autosomal trisomy. The biological basis for this observation is that oocytes reach metaphase I during the fetal period (five months postfertilization) and remain aligned on the metaphase plate until the oocyte is stimulated to divide, just prior to ovulation. Age-related errors appear to increase the risk of nondisjunction leading to unequal chromosome products at completion of division. These age-related errors may be related to cumulative oxidative stress, depletion in the number of normal oocytes available for maturation, and shortening of oocyte telomeres [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-advanced-maternal-age-on-pregnancy/abstract/29-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-34</a>]. </p><p>Theoretically, preimplantation selection of chromosomally and morphologically normal embryos could increase the chances of successful implantation and ongoing pregnancy, as well as avoid chromosomally abnormal births. Despite the high number of aneuploid embryos which are excluded from transfer by this procedure, data from randomized trials and controlled studies have shown that preimplantation selection neither improve the implantation rate nor the rate of live birth, but decreases multiple gestation rates. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=preimplantation-genetic-screening#H5938611\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Preimplantation genetic screening&quot;, section on 'Advanced maternal age'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Gene abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are sparse data on the effect of advanced maternal age on single gene disorders and epigenetic events, other than in the setting of assisted reproduction. Epidemiologic studies have reported an association between advanced maternal and paternal age and risk of autism spectrum disorders in offspring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-advanced-maternal-age-on-pregnancy/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Although not proven as an independent risk factor for autism, parental age should be examined in large, population-based birth cohorts that have carefully examined potential confounders. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=autism-spectrum-disorder-terminology-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Autism spectrum disorder: Terminology, epidemiology, and pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'Parental age'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Congenital malformations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of having a child with a congenital anomaly may increase with increasing maternal age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-advanced-maternal-age-on-pregnancy/abstract/22,36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,36,37</a>]. Historically, an increase in congenital anomalies with advancing maternal age has been attributed to the recognized increase of aneuploidy with advancing maternal age and the association of aneuploid fetuses with structural anomalies. However, several analyses have suggested that the risk of nonchromosomal anomalies also increases as women age. Cardiac anomalies, in particular, seem to increase with maternal age independent of aneuploidy.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The US National Birth Defects Prevention Study (NBDPS) is a population-based case control study that assessed the association between birth defects and maternal age, adjusted for <span class=\"nowrap\">race/ethnicity,</span> body mass index, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> use, gravidity, education, smoking, and parental age difference [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-advanced-maternal-age-on-pregnancy/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The study included 20,377 case infants and 8169 control infants and excluded infants with recognized or strongly suspected chromosomal abnormalities or single gene disorders. Compared with the reference group of women 25 to 29 years of age, offspring of women &ge;40 years of age were at increased risk of several types of cardiac defects (aOR 2.2-2.9), as well as for esophageal atresia (aOR, 2.9; 95% CI 1.7-4.9), hypospadias (aOR, 2.0; 95% CI 1.4-3.0), and craniosynostosis (aOR, 1.6; 95% CI 1.1-2.4).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the FASTER trial, the rates of major congenital anomalies for offspring of women &lt;35, 35 to 39, and &ge;40 years of age were 1.7, 2.8, and 2.9 percent, respectively (odds ratios for women &ge;35 compared to women &lt;35 ranged from 1.4 to 1.7) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-advanced-maternal-age-on-pregnancy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Given the large size of this trial, the authors considered an OR &gt;2 to be clinically significant, and none of these mathematically significant ORs reached this level of clinical relevance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-advanced-maternal-age-on-pregnancy/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lastly, an in depth analysis of all pregnancy outcomes (livebirths, stillbirths, and terminations) within a geographically confined region of Texas revealed the risk for all nonchromosomal congenital anomalies increased with advancing maternal age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-advanced-maternal-age-on-pregnancy/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Fetuses of women 20 to 24 years of age had a congenital malformation rate of 3.5 percent, which was lower than the rate in women 35 to 39 years and &ge;40 years (4.4 and 5.0 percent, respectively). Cardiac anomalies were notably increased, as well as clubfoot and congenital diaphragmatic hernia.</p><p/><p>Results worldwide have not been consistent with all of these findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-advanced-maternal-age-on-pregnancy/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. Differences in study design, case definition, and potential confounders may play a role in these discrepancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-advanced-maternal-age-on-pregnancy/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">LATE PREGNANCY ISSUES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some obstetrical complications in older women appear to be related to the aging process alone, while others are largely related to coexisting factors such as multiple gestation, higher parity, and chronic medical conditions, which are less likely to be observed in younger women. Both may contribute to increased pregnancy-related maternal morbidity that is reported in older women. In a population-based study of nearly 830,000 singleton births from Washington State, women ages &ge;40 years had an eightfold increased risk of amniotic fluid embolism and threefold increased risk of obstetric shock compared with women age 25 to 29 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-advanced-maternal-age-on-pregnancy/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Women in the age 45 to 49 category had a 16-fold increased risk of renal failure and nearly fivefold increased risk of both obstetric intervention and admission to the intensive care unit. When the groups were stratified by age and compared with reference women age 25 to 29 years, the adjusted overall risk difference was 0.9 percent for women age 40 to 44 years, 1.6 percent for women age 45 to 49 years, and 6.4 percent for women age 50 or greater. For women &ge;50 years, the rate of severe maternal morbidity was greater than the rate of mortality or serious morbidity of their children. Of note, the adjusted risk analysis controlled for maternal race, education, smoking status, marriage status, insurance type, parity, body mass index, assisted conception, neonatal sex, congenital anomalies, and medical conditions including diabetes and hypertension.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Effects of coexisting medical conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of medical and surgical illnesses, such as cancer; cardiovascular, renal, and autoimmune disease; and obesity increases with advancing age. For this reason, women &ge;35 years of age can expect to experience two- to three-fold higher rates of hospitalization, cesarean delivery, and pregnancy-related complications than their younger counterparts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-advanced-maternal-age-on-pregnancy/abstract/22,42-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,42-50</a>]. Smoking has been associated with increased perinatal morbidity and stillbirth in all age groups, but the risk is particularly high in older smokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-advanced-maternal-age-on-pregnancy/abstract/51-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">51-53</a>].

Among older mothers, birthweight was slightly, but significantly, lower in every group (&lt;2500 g, &lt;1500 g, &lt;1250 g, &lt;1000 g) (OR 1.1 to 1.6), as was the rate of PTD (&lt;37, &lt;35, &lt;32, and &lt;30 weeks of gestation) (OR 1.1 to 1.3).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A population-based study from the United States reported adjusted odds ratios for delivering a LBW white infant increased progressively with each five-year increase in maternal age, reaching 2.3 (95% CI 1.6-3.4) in women &ge;40 years versus those aged 20 to 24 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-advanced-maternal-age-on-pregnancy/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].

A population based cohort study of over 12,000 neonates &lt;33 weeks of gestation admitted to Canadian NICUs observed a trend of higher rates of neonatal survival without morbidity with increasing maternal age (adjusted OR 1.047, 95% CI 1.001-1.095) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-advanced-maternal-age-on-pregnancy/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p>In contrast to the studies listed above, at least one study has reported that advancing maternal age may not independently increase the risk of low birth weight or preterm delivery. In a Finnish birth register study of over 124,000 children born between 1987 and 2000, there was no relationship between advanced maternal age and low birth weight or preterm birth when in-family models were evaluated (ie, children born to same mother at different maternal ages), although a small increased risk was reported for between-family models (ie, children born to different mothers at different ages), consistent with prior studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-advanced-maternal-age-on-pregnancy/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. One possible explanation is the presence of factors not accounted for in the model that increase the risk of both giving birth at an older age and increase the risk of low birth weight or preterm delivery. Further studies are needed to determine if this finding can be replicated and if the information applies to women beyond Finland. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Perinatal mortality</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26050205\"><span class=\"h3\">Fetal death</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Large studies worldwide consistently report that older women (&ge;35 years of age) are at significantly increased risk of stillbirth compared with younger women. A systematic review and meta-analysis of these studies calculated that maternal age older than 35 years was associated with a 65 percent increase in the odds of stillbirth (effect size 1.65, 95% CI 1.61-1.71) compared with younger women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-advanced-maternal-age-on-pregnancy/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. The relative risk of stillbirth increased with increasing maternal age (ie, higher at age 40 than at age 35). The increased risk of stillbirth is most notable after about 37 weeks of gestation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F75607\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75607 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-advanced-maternal-age-on-pregnancy/abstract/69,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">69,70</a>]. &#160;</p><p>The excess perinatal mortality experienced by older women is largely due to non-anomalous fetal deaths, which are often unexplained, even after controlling for risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, antepartum bleeding, smoking, and multiple gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-advanced-maternal-age-on-pregnancy/abstract/1,62,69,71-78\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,62,69,71-78</a>].

The risk of stillbirth for women under age 35, age 35 to 39 years old, and over 40 years old was 3.73, 6.41, and 8.65 per 1000 ongoing pregnancies, respectively.

In a United States cohort study of over 78,000 singleton births between 2003 and 2012, the proportion of women undergoing a primary cesarean delivery increased with age for both primiparous and multiparous women (women with a prior cesarean delivery were excluded from study) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-advanced-maternal-age-on-pregnancy/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. By years of age, the primary cesarean delivery rate was 20 percent for women ages 25 to 34 years, 26 percent for women 35 to 39 years, 31 percent for women 40 to 44 years, 36 percent for women 45 to 49 years, and 61 percent for women &ge;50 years. For comparison, the overall primary cesarean delivery rate for singleton births in the United States was approximately 22 percent during a similar time period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-advanced-maternal-age-on-pregnancy/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>].</p><p>The reasons for the high rate of operative delivery in older women are controversial, but include an increased prevalence of medical complications, induction of labor, and fetal malposition, as well as a lower threshold among both patients and physicians for performing a cesarean delivery. Maternal request for cesarean delivery is becoming more common, particularly among older gravidae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-advanced-maternal-age-on-pregnancy/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cesarean-delivery-on-maternal-request\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cesarean delivery on maternal request&quot;</a>.)</p><p>When specific indications for cesarean birth are evaluated, older women appear to have an increased risk of failure of labor to progress normally.

In contrast, a study in Israeli women reported that women with late-age births (birth at age 45 years or older) had an approximately 40 percent lower mortality risk compared with women whose last birth was before age 35 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/effects-of-advanced-maternal-age-on-pregnancy/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]. This discrepancy suggests that factors other than reproductive age are involved.
