They are frequently discussed together because:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PMR occurs in about 40 to 50 percent of people with GCA.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>GCA occurs in approximately 10 to 15 percent of people with PMR.</p><p/><p>The two disorders do not necessarily occur at the same time.</p><p>More detailed information about PMR and GCA is available elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-giant-cell-arteritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of giant cell arteritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">POLYMYALGIA RHEUMATICA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common symptoms of polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aching and stiffness in the morning, often for several hours or for a shorter period after rest during the day, located in the shoulders and upper arms, hips and thighs, and back of the neck. Some people have trouble getting dressed (eg, fastening a bra, putting on a shirt or jacket, or pulling on stockings). Difficulty raising the arms above the shoulders is a typical symptom.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Occasional swelling or stiffness of the small joints of the hands. Swelling in the wrist can lead to numbness, tingling, and pain in the hands (called carpal tunnel syndrome).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling of tiredness, poor appetite, weight loss, or fever.</p><p/><p>Symptoms of PMR usually come on rather abruptly over a period of weeks, sometimes days.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Polymyalgia rheumatica diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A combination of approaches is used to diagnose PMR, including a history, physical exam, and lab tests. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Most people who are diagnosed with PMR:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are older adults in their 60s or 70s. PMR virtually never occurs under the age of 50.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have persisting aching and morning stiffness (lasting 30 minutes or more) on both sides of the body, and involving at least two of the following three areas: neck or upper body, shoulders or upper arms, and hips or upper thighs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have an elevated level of inflammation, which can be measured with a blood test (the erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C-reactive protein).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Polymyalgia rheumatica treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PMR responds quickly to low doses of glucocorticoids (also called steroids), medications that reduce inflammation. Prednisone and prednisolone are two commonly used glucocorticoids. Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; such as ibuprofen or naproxen) are ineffective.</p><p>During your treatment, it is very important to call your doctor or nurse if you develop any new symptoms that could be caused by giant cell arteritis (GCA), such as a change in vision, headaches, jaw or arm pain or weakness, or a new cough. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Giant cell arteritis symptoms'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people feel better after the first few doses of a glucocorticoid. Your doctor or nurse will gradually decrease the dose every two to four weeks to find the minimum dose that is needed to prevent symptoms. Most people need to take glucocorticoids for one to two years, although some people require an even longer course of treatment.</p><p>Glucocorticoids can have serious side effects when taken for long periods of time. Side effects can include weight gain, weakening of the bones, and diabetes. Taking the lowest possible dose for the shortest possible time can help to reduce the chance of these side effects.</p><p>As the dose of the glucocorticoid is reduced, stiffness and pain can recur. Decreasing the dose slowly can minimize these symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">GIANT CELL ARTERITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Giant cell arteritis, also called GCA or temporal arteritis, is a type of blood vessel inflammation that damages medium- and large-sized arteries. The most commonly affected arteries are those that start in the neck and travel into the head and scalp.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">How are polymyalgia rheumatica and giant cell arteritis related?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Almost one-half of people with GCA have polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR). About 10 to 15 percent of people with PMR have GCA. It is not clear why the conditions often occur together.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Giant cell arteritis symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common symptoms include new headaches, jaw or arm pain or weakness, difficulty seeing clearly (especially out of one eye), or a new cough. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-giant-cell-temporal-arteritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of giant cell (temporal) arteritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other symptoms can include developing a fever (usually less than 101&ordm;F or 38&ordm;C), feeling tired, and weight loss.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache &ndash; The pain, which may be mild or severe, tends to be located over the temples but may be in the front or back of the skull (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F65142\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65142 \">figure 1</a>). Some people also notice tenderness in the scalp.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Jaw pain (claudication) &ndash; Nearly one-half of people with GCA suffer from jaw pain, which develops while chewing food. This is also called jaw claudication. Claudication develops because of inadequate blood flow to the muscles involved in chewing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vision loss &ndash; Up to 20 percent of people with GCA can develop partial or complete blindness. Changes in vision may be a first sign of GCA. Vision loss usually begins suddenly, with difficulty seeing out of one eye. If untreated, vision in the second eye can also be affected. It is rare, however, to become completely blind in both eyes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arm claudication &ndash; Arm claudication causes pain in the arm, especially when moving the arm. It can develop when the arteries to the arm are narrowed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Upper respiratory complaints &ndash; About 10 percent of people with GCA develop a dry cough or a sore throat.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thoracic aortic aneurysms &ndash; A thoracic aortic aneurysm occurs when the aorta, the main artery that carries blood from the heart, develops a weak spot and balloons outward. Aneurysms do not cause symptoms but can be life-threatening if they burst. While uncommon, this occurs somewhat more frequently in patients with GCA.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">People with GCA are sometimes tested for this type of aneurysm with a chest radiograph, echocardiography, or possibly with other imaging techniques. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-thoracic-aortic-aneurysm-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of thoracic aortic aneurysm in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Giant cell arteritis diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor or nurse will perform tests for GCA if you have some of the symptoms listed above. He or she will perform an exam and will order some blood tests. If the blood tests show signs of GCA, you will need a biopsy of one or both arteries in the temples (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F65142\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65142 \">figure 1</a>), or you may need imaging tests (eg, radiograph, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] or positron emission tomography [PET] scanning).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Giant cell arteritis treatment</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Glucocorticoid</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glucocorticoid (also called steroid) treatment in higher doses is usually recommended once the diagnosis of GCA is strongly suspected, even before it has been proven by biopsy.</p><p>If there is no evidence of arteritis on biopsy or on ultrasound and other imaging studies, and if your doctor is not convinced you have GCA, he or she will recommend stopping glucocorticoids (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-giant-cell-arteritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of giant cell arteritis&quot;</a>). Sometimes glucocorticoid treatment is continued, even if there is no confirmation of arteritis, especially if your doctor strongly suspects that you have GCA.</p><p>Many people continue taking glucocorticoids for several months or up to one to two years. The dose of glucocorticoids is tapered slowly and carefully so that symptoms of GCA do not recur.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Other treatments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other treatments for GCA have been tried, such as methotrexate or tocilizumab, but these treatments are only used as supplements to glucocorticoids. Only glucocorticoids have been shown to be effective for the treatment of GCA and, in particular, for the prevention of loss of vision, but newer treatments are being actively investigated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">LONG-TERM OUTLOOK</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Polymyalgia rheumatica</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most people, polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) tends to run its course over one to several years, and glucocorticoid therapy can eventually be stopped. In some patients, the disease can persist.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Giant cell arteritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Giant cell arteritis (GCA) also tends to run its course over one to several years, though occasionally headache and other symptoms can reappear during the first few months after it has been diagnosed. But it is important to remember that if vision is intact when GCA is diagnosed, and if higher-dose, daily glucocorticoid treatment is started immediately, the risk of future vision loss is very small. The dose of glucocorticoids can eventually be reduced and then stopped in many if not most patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your healthcare provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your medical problem.</p><p>This article will be updated as needed on our web site (<a href=\"http://www.uptodate.com/patients&amp;token=nygaOTnDuGxGrKiuwLIxjMIsa91xyzRx3QvmgfDh4FTTVfpiGy3XGWFyzaLmJXXU&amp;TOPIC_ID=576\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.uptodate.com/patients</a>).
