Most fetuses tolerate this process well, but some do not. The fetal heart rate (FHR) pattern helps to distinguish the former from the latter as it is an indirect marker of fetal cardiac and central nervous system responses to changes in blood pressure, blood gases, and acid-base status. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonstress-test-and-contraction-stress-test#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonstress test and contraction stress test&quot;, section on 'Physiologic basis of fetal heart rate changes'</a>.)</p><p>The rationale for intrapartum FHR monitoring is that identification of FHR changes potentially associated with inadequate fetal oxygenation may enable timely intervention to reduce the likelihood of hypoxic injury or death. Although virtually all obstetric societies advise monitoring the FHR during labor, the benefit of this intervention has not been clearly demonstrated and this position is largely based upon expert opinion and medicolegal precedent.</p><p>The procedure for intrapartum FHR monitoring, physiology behind FHR accelerations and decelerations, classification of FHR tracings, and use of ancillary tests to evaluate the fetus will be discussed here. Intrapartum management of category I, II, and III FHR tracing is reviewed separately.

Antepartum FHR monitoring (nonstress test, contraction stress test) is also reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonstress-test-and-contraction-stress-test\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonstress test and contraction stress test&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DOES INTRAPARTUM FHR MONITORING IMPROVE OUTCOME?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although some evidence suggests that intrapartum fetal monitoring is associated with a reduction in intrapartum death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fetal-heart-rate-assessment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], a reduction in long-term neurologic impairment has not been proven. All available data are derived from trials comparing continuous electronic monitoring with intermittent auscultation. There are no randomized trials of intrapartum fetal monitoring versus no intrapartum fetal monitoring.</p><p>For both low- and high-risk pregnancies, continuous electronic FHR monitoring is not clearly superior to intermittent auscultation with respect to preventing death or poor long-term neurologic outcome, and has a high false-positive rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fetal-heart-rate-assessment/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. A 2017 systematic review that compared continuous electronic FHR monitoring with intermittent auscultation (13 randomized trials, &gt;37,000 low- and high-risk pregnancies) reported the following major findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fetal-heart-rate-assessment/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No significant differences between techniques were noted for the following <span class=\"nowrap\">newborn/childhood</span> outcomes: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Acidemia (measured in cord blood) (relative risk [RR] 0.92, 95% CI 0.27-3.11)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Apgar score &lt;4 at five minutes (RR 1.80, 95% CI 0.71-4.59)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Neonatal intensive care unit admission (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.86-1.18)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (RR 0.46, 95% CI 0.04-5.03)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Perinatal mortality (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.59-1.24)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Neurodevelopmental impairment at &ge;12 months of age (RR 3.88, 95% CI 0.83-18.2)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cerebral palsy (RR 1.75, 95% CI 0.84-3.63)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although use of continuous electronic FHR monitoring resulted in fewer neonatal seizures (RR 0.50, 95% CI 0.31-0.80), there were no differences in long-term neurologic outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fetal-heart-rate-assessment/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Continuous electronic FHR monitoring resulted in more operative vaginal deliveries for abnormal FHR patterns or acidosis (RR 2.54 [95% CI 1.95-3.31]), fewer spontaneous vaginal births (RR 0.91, 95% CI 0.86-0.96), and more cesarean deliveries for abnormal FHR patterns or acidosis (RR 2.38, 95% CI 1.89-3.01). Overall risks of instrumental vaginal and cesarean delivery were also statistically increased (RR 1.15 and 1.63, respectively). Data for low-risk and high-risk subgroups, preterm pregnancies, and high-quality trials were consistent with these overall results.</p><p/><p>One important limitation of these findings is that none of the more contemporary trials (which included a substantially larger number of patients) demonstrated a significant difference in the rate of cesarean delivery between patients monitored continuously and those monitored by intermittent auscultation, in contrast to all four of the randomized trials published before 1980, which demonstrated significantly higher rates of cesarean delivery in continuously monitored patients. Another important limitation is that a statistical reduction in the perinatal death rate is difficult to demonstrate because death is a rare outcome. In the 2017 meta-analysis, even the pooled results from multiple randomized trials lacked sufficient power to permit a definitive conclusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fetal-heart-rate-assessment/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. However, a previous meta-analysis that specifically evaluated perinatal deaths attributed to fetal hypoxia in low- and high-risk pregnancies concluded that this outcome was significantly less common in continuously monitored patients than those monitored with intermittent auscultation <span class=\"nowrap\">(7/9398</span> versus <span class=\"nowrap\">17/9163;</span> 0.7 versus 1.8 per 1000; odds ratio 0.41, 95% CI 0.17-0.98; nine trials) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fetal-heart-rate-assessment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>A statistical reduction in the incidence of cerebral palsy with continuous intrapartum FHR monitoring is also difficult to prove for several reasons. Many cases of cerebral palsy are due to antepartum, rather than intrapartum, events. In such cases, intrapartum interventions are unlikely to change the course of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fetal-heart-rate-assessment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Most FHR abnormalities are not associated with fetal acidemia or hypoxemia, and most fetal acidemia and hypoxemia does not result in neurologic disability. In fact, one study calculated that 99.8 percent of &quot;abnormal&quot; FHR tracings are not associated with the later development of cerebral palsy, yielding a positive predictive value that is equal to, or lower than, the prevalence of cerebral palsy in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fetal-heart-rate-assessment/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Another potentially confounding factor is that a preexisting fetal neurologic disorder may be the cause, rather than the result, of an intrapartum FHR abnormality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fetal-heart-rate-assessment/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In many cases, the interventions that are undertaken in the setting of abnormal FHR tracings may alter the natural history of fetal oxygen deprivation, potentially decoupling fetal heart rate abnormalities from hypoxic neurologic sequelae such as cerebral palsy. Lastly, the degree of fetal oxygen deprivation that leads to long-term neurologic injury is close to that causing fetal death; thus, many severely depressed term fetuses may either survive intact or die, rather than survive with disability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fetal-heart-rate-assessment/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CANDIDATES FOR INTRAPARTUM FETAL MONITORING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Any pregnancy in which detection of a FHR abnormality would prompt intervention, such as conservative maneuvers to improve fetal oxygenation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cesarean delivery, is a candidate for intrapartum fetal monitoring.</p><p>Some degree of FHR monitoring during labor has become routine in the United States, even though the clinical benefit has not been established conclusively (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Does intrapartum FHR monitoring improve outcome?'</a> above).

Internal FHR monitoring is preferable when the externally-derived tracing is difficult to obtain or interpret because of poor technical quality. This may result from a number of conditions, including prematurity, maternal obesity, frequent maternal or fetal movement, uterine myomata, polyhydramnios, or multiple gestation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Noninvasive (external) electronic monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Noninvasive (external) FHR monitoring can be performed continuously or intermittently with a Doppler ultrasound device on the maternal abdomen. This device detects the motion of the fetal heart and uses this information to create a complex wave form. The computer then detects the peaks of successive waves to calculate a mechanical R wave-to-R wave (RR) interval. To minimize artifact caused by the inherent variation in the Doppler ultrasound signal, the computer calculates the FHR by averaging several consecutive RR intervals. This technology, called autocorrelation, reduces signal variation and produces a processed sound, which is not the actual fetal heartbeat. The FHR tracing derived from Doppler ultrasound using the autocorrelation technique closely resembles that derived from a fetal electrocardiogram (ECG), although baseline variability may be more apparent with the Doppler technique. An alternative technology (eg, Monica AN24) uses several electrodes placed on the maternal abdomen to detect the electrical fetal RR interval. Wireless monitors enable FHR monitoring while the women is ambulating [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fetal-heart-rate-assessment/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Invasive (internal) electronic monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A fetal ECG can be obtained by placing a bipolar spiral electrode into the fetal scalp transcervically; a second reference electrode is placed on the maternal thigh to eliminate electrical interference from maternal cardiac activity. A computer calculates the FHR based on the RR interval (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F65200\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef65200 \">waveform 1</a>). Artifact is minimal so the signal is clear and provides accurate measurement of the variability between successive heartbeats without the need for autocorrelation.</p><p>Application of artificial intelligence computer programs to fetal ECG signal processing has led to development of devices to overcome the limitations of FHR pattern interpretation by human observers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fetal-heart-rate-assessment/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. This has been made possible by technical improvements in signal acquisition and processing, and by algorithms for pattern interpretation based on standardization of visual pattern analysis and correlation with fetal scalp blood and umbilical artery pH determinations. As an example, the STAN monitor analyzes the fetal T wave and ST segment. However, this technology has not been widely adopted in the United States and remains investigational. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'ST analysis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H259487543\"><span class=\"h2\">Frequency and duration of monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Upon admission to the labor unit, the FHR is assessed for a minimum of 20 to 30 minutes, along with uterine activity and maternal vital signs. The goal is to identify fetuses who have or are at increased risk for abnormal intrapartum FHR patterns and who might benefit from continuous rather than intermittent intrapartum FHR monitoring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fetal-heart-rate-assessment/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This initial assessment and additional assessments during labor may also inform decisions regarding the use of uterine stimulants, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a> or prostaglandins. A 2017 systematic review of randomized trials found that the &quot;labor admission test&quot; did not reliably predict fetal ability to tolerate labor over time in low-risk pregnancies and did not reduce neonatal morbidity compared with&nbsp;intermittent auscultation&nbsp;of the FHR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fetal-heart-rate-assessment/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. There were insufficient data to draw conclusions about the value of the admission test in women with high-risk pregnancies.</p><p>A common practice in low-risk pregnancies with a normal initial FHR pattern is to continuously monitor the FHR when possible (ie, patient is not ambulating, bathing, moving around, etc) and review the FHR at least every 30 minutes in the active phase of the first stage of labor, and at least every 15 minutes in the second stage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fetal-heart-rate-assessment/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. High-risk pregnancies are monitored continuously and the FHR is usually reviewed at least every 15 minutes in the active phase of the first stage of labor, and at least every 5 minutes in the second stage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fetal-heart-rate-assessment/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The interpretation of the FHR should be documented in the intrapartum record.</p><p>As discussed above, intermittent auscultation is rarely used intrapartum in the United States (see <a href=\"#H4230002941\" class=\"local\">'Continuous monitoring versus intermittent auscultation: Recommendations of selected national organizations'</a> above). If intermittent auscultation is used in low-risk pregnancies, a standard approach is to determine, evaluate and record the FHR during and immediately after a uterine contraction at least every 30 minutes during the active phase of the first stage of labor and at least every 15 minutes during the second stage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fetal-heart-rate-assessment/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. If risk factors are present, the FHR is determined, evaluated and recorded preferably before, during, and after a uterine contraction at least every 15 minutes during the active phase of the first stage of labor and at least every 5 minutes during the second stage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSIOLOGIC SIGNIFICANCE OF SELECTED FHR CHARACTERISTICS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H858240689\"><span class=\"h2\">Baseline FHR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A normal baseline FHR is 110 to 160 bpm, and reflects lack of pathology or pathologic effects from factors that regulate FHR. These factors include intrinsic cardiac pacemakers (sinoatrial node, atrioventricular node), cardiac conduction pathways, autonomic innervation (sympathetic, parasympathetic), intrinsic humoral factors (catecholamines), extrinsic factors (medications), and local factors (calcium, potassium), which are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonstress-test-and-contraction-stress-test#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonstress test and contraction stress test&quot;, section on 'Physiologic basis of fetal heart rate changes'</a>.)</p><p>Baseline bradycardia may be associated with maternal beta-blocker therapy, hypothermia, hypoglycemia, hypothyroidism, or fetal heart block or interruption of fetal oxygenation.

Moderate baseline variability reflects the oxygenation of the central nervous system and reliably predicts the absence of damaging degrees of hypoxia-induced metabolic acidemia at the time it is observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fetal-heart-rate-assessment/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>].</p><p>However, the converse is <strong>not</strong> true: Minimal or absent variability alone is a poor predictor of fetal metabolic acidemia or hypoxic injury at the time it is observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fetal-heart-rate-assessment/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Other conditions potentially associated with minimal or absent variability include fetal sleep cycle, arrhythmia, medications, extreme prematurity, congenital anomalies, or preexisting neurologic injury. Most of the literature regarding decreased variability does not differentiate between absent variability (amplitude range undetectable) and minimal variability (amplitude range detectable but &le;5 bpm). Therefore, it is not possible to make definitive conclusions about the clinical significance of absent versus minimal variability.</p><p>The significance of marked variability is unknown.

In a large cohort study comparing neonatal outcomes of more than 380,000 spontaneous vaginal deliveries with those of more than 33,000 cesarean deliveries without labor, neonates exposed to uterine contractions of sufficient duration, frequency and intensity to result in vaginal delivery had no higher rates of mechanical brain injury (intracranial hemorrhage) than those with no exposure to labor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fetal-heart-rate-assessment/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2119553486\"><span class=\"h2\">Decelerations related to interruption of fetal oxygenation</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1241455043\"><span class=\"h3\">Late deceleration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most cases, a late deceleration is a reflex fetal response to transient hypoxemia during a uterine contraction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F65859\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65859 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F67464\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef67464 \">waveform 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F96432\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef96432 \">waveform 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F96977\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef96977 \">waveform 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F96980\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef96980 \">waveform 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F96978\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef96978 \">waveform 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fetal-heart-rate-assessment/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. When uterine contractions compress maternal blood vessels traversing the uterine wall, maternal perfusion of the intervillous space of the placenta is reduced. Reduced delivery of oxygenated blood to the intervillous space can reduce diffusion of oxygen into the fetal capillary blood in the chorionic villi, leading to a decline in fetal PO<sub>2</sub>. When fetal PO<sub>2</sub> falls below the normal range (approximately 15 to 25 mmHg in the umbilical artery), chemoreceptors initiate an autonomic reflex response. Initially, sympathetic outflow causes peripheral vasoconstriction, shunting oxygenated blood flow away from non-vital vascular beds and toward vital organs such as the brain, heart and adrenal glands. The resulting increase in fetal blood pressure is detected by baroreceptors, which trigger a parasympathetic reflex and slow the heart rate, reduce cardiac output, and return blood pressure to normal. After the contraction, fetal oxygenation is restored, autonomic reflexes subside, and the FHR gradually returns to baseline. This combined sympathetic-parasympathetic reflex response to transient interruption of fetal oxygenation has been confirmed in animal studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fetal-heart-rate-assessment/abstract/27-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-36</a>]. Interruption of the oxygen pathway to the fetus can occur at multiple maternal levels in addition to uterine contractions, such as the lungs (eg, maternal hypoxemia), heart (eg, poor cardiac output) or vasculature (eg, hypotension).</p><p>Rarely, fetal oxygenation is interrupted sufficiently to result in both severe hypoxemia and metabolic acidemia and, in turn, direct myocardial depression and late decelerations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fetal-heart-rate-assessment/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Late decelerations related to severe hypoxemia, metabolic acidemia, and myocardial depression are predictive of an increased risk for adverse neonatal outcome.

Before 32 weeks of gestation, accelerations with a rise of &ge;10 bpm and a duration of &ge;10 seconds almost always assure the absence of fetal acidemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fetal-heart-rate-assessment/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>In the absence of spontaneous FHR accelerations, the fetal scalp stimulation maneuver is easy to perform, inexpensive, readily available, and not uncomfortable. The examiner stimulates the fetal vertex by prodding it with the examining finger or an instrument, such as an Allis clamp, during a vaginal examination or by vibroacoustic stimulation at the maternal abdominal wall overlying the uterus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fetal-heart-rate-assessment/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. This should be performed when the FHR is at its baseline rate. Performance during a deceleration is not likely to terminate the deceleration, is not predictive of fetal acid-base status, and might exacerbate fetal compromise if parasympathetic tone increases in response to the stimulus.</p><p>When accelerations are induced in this setting, the fetal pH is &gt;7.20 in over 90 percent of cases, and when no accelerations occur, pH is &lt;7.20 in approximately 50 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fetal-heart-rate-assessment/abstract/65-69\" class=\"abstract_t\">65-69</a>].

Less traumatic techniques (vibroacoustic stimulation, digital scalp stimulation) are preferable to more traumatic techniques (fetal scalp puncture, Allis clamp scalp stimulation). For digital stimulation, the pooled likelihood ratio (LR) for acidemia with a negative test (ie, acceleration elicited) was 0.06 (95% CI 0.01-0.31). Failure to elicit an acceleration was not a definitive sign of acidemia.

Use of this device is based on the principle that fetal hypoxemia can result in elevation or depression of the ST segment. The monitor's software automatically identifies and analyzes changes in the T wave and the ST segment of the fetal ECG, which is obtained via a spiral electrode attached to the fetal scalp. The analysis is displayed in the lower section of the monitor's screen as a series of data points <span class=\"nowrap\">(&quot;T/QRS</span> crosses&quot;) and event markers. A visual alert (&quot;ST event&quot;) appears when ST changes occur. Studies have reported the STAN computerized interpretation of FHR monitoring system has 38 to 90 percent sensitivity and 83 to 100 percent specificity for detecting fetal acidemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fetal-heart-rate-assessment/abstract/70-72\" class=\"abstract_t\">70-72</a>].</p><p>Clinicians who choose to use ST analysis should be trained and credentialed in its use and interpretation. The STAN S31 fetal heart monitor has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration as an adjunct to assessment of abnormal FHR tracings in pregnancies over 36 weeks of gestation, in labor, with vertex presentation and ruptured fetal membranes. It is not indicated for monitoring initiated in the second stage of labor, since there may not be enough time to establish the baseline fetal ECG data required for automatic ST event signals. Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation (TENS) for analgesia during labor is another contraindication because TENS may interfere with acquisition of the fetal ECG signal.</p><p>Three meta-analyses concluded use of ST-analysis did not result in meaningful improvements in pregnancy outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fetal-heart-rate-assessment/abstract/73-75\" class=\"abstract_t\">73-75</a>]. As an example, in a 2016 systematic review and meta-analysis including seven randomized trials with a total of over 27,000 pregnancies, intrapartum fetal electrocardiogram analysis (PR to RR interval, ST segment) did not improve any neonatal outcome or decrease cesarean delivery rates compared with continuous electronic&nbsp;fetal&nbsp;heart rate&nbsp;monitoring&nbsp;alone, but fewer fetal scalp sampling procedures were performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fetal-heart-rate-assessment/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. The largest randomized trial in the review assigned over 11,000 women to &quot;open&quot; or &quot;masked&quot; monitoring with fetal ST-segment analysis and reported no significant between-group differences in the rate of cesarean delivery, any operative delivery, or the primary composite outcome (stillbirth, neonatal death, five-minute Apgar score &le;3, cord artery pH &le;7.05 and base deficit in extracellular fluid &ge;12, intubation in the delivery room, seizures, neonatal encephalopathy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fetal-heart-rate-assessment/abstract/65,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,72</a>].</p><p>These conclusions have been challenged in an editorial in which the authors asserted that, while the meta-analyses of ST-analysis did not confirm a significant reduction in perinatal death, neonatal seizures, or neonatal encephalopathy, these outcomes are so uncommon that it is unlikely a study large enough to prove no benefit statistically will ever be performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fetal-heart-rate-assessment/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. They also argued that reductions in the rates of fetal blood sampling, operative vaginal delivery and metabolic acidemia are not irrelevant, despite the lack of reduction in hard outcomes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h3\">Fetal scalp blood sampling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fetal scalp blood sampling is an intrapartum procedure intended to assess the presence and degree of fetal acidemia by analyzing fetal capillary blood. An amnioscope with a light source is used to expose the fetal scalp, which is cleansed of blood, mucous, and amniotic fluid. The scalp is smeared with silicone gel so that a droplet of blood forms when the scalp is punctured with a 2-mm blade. The blood is collected in long, heparinized capillary tubes. The test requires that the cervix is dilated at least 2 to 3 cm, can be difficult to perform, and can be uncomfortable for the parturient. It is contraindicated when the mother is known to have a serious transmissible infection, such as HIV or hepatitis, and in fetuses at increased risk of a bleeding diathesis. Rare complications described in case reports include infection, hemorrhage, and leakage of cerebrospinal fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fetal-heart-rate-assessment/abstract/77-79\" class=\"abstract_t\">77-79</a>].</p><p>Both pH and lactate measurements require the same laboratory facilities for microsample analysis. Less blood is needed for measurement of lactate than pH, otherwise one test does not clearly perform better than the other [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fetal-heart-rate-assessment/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. Intrapartum fetal scalp blood sampling to measure pH or lactate has not been clearly proven to reduce emergency cesarean deliveries or operative vaginal births or to improve long-term perinatal outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fetal-heart-rate-assessment/abstract/81,82\" class=\"abstract_t\">81,82</a>]. For this reason and many others, including quality control issues, cost, patient discomfort, sample failure rates up to 10 percent, and unavailability of sampling kits, fetal scalp blood sampling is performed rarely in the United States and elsewhere.

In the setting of an abnormal FHR pattern, fetal SpO2 &lt;30 percent for greater than 10 minutes has been associated with an increased risk of fetal acidemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fetal-heart-rate-assessment/abstract/72,73,85-88\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,73,85-88</a>].</p><p>However, in a 2014 systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials comparing the outcome of pregnancies in which both fetal pulse oximetry and cardiotocography results were available for intrapartum clinical management with the outcome of controls in which only cardiotocography results were available (n = seven trials, 8013 women), fetal pulse oximetry had no statistical effect on the overall rate of cesarean delivery or the rate of maternal or infant outcomes evaluated; the rates were similar in both groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fetal-heart-rate-assessment/abstract/69,89\" class=\"abstract_t\">69,89</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3093960451\"><span class=\"h2\">Use of decision aids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although recognition and management of category I and III tracings is relatively straightforward, the potential for development of progressive fetal hypoxia, metabolic acidosis, and metabolic acidemia varies widely across the different types of category II tracings. In part for this reason, investigators have proposed various algorithmic approaches to recognition, interpretation, and management of FHR tracings beyond category I. These approaches have had some success in achieving earlier recognition of tracings associated with metabolic acidemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fetal-heart-rate-assessment/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. However, their ability to improve neonatal outcome <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> reduce unnecessary interventions remains unproven, thus a change in the standard clinical approach described above is not warranted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fetal-heart-rate-assessment/abstract/91,92\" class=\"abstract_t\">91,92</a>].</p><p>The following are examples of some decision aids:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A five-tier FHR classification system has been proposed to identify fetuses at risk of developing acidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fetal-heart-rate-assessment/abstract/93-95\" class=\"abstract_t\">93-95</a>]. The system focuses on baseline FHR, variability, and decelerations to stratify the risk of evolution to acidemia. Depending on risk level, the system suggests different interventions, such as conservative measures or delivery. The five-tier has not been validated in a large prospective or randomized trial and no data are available to indicate that it improves neonatal outcome or reduces operative intervention.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An online risk assessment calculator is available for management of category II tracings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fetal-heart-rate-assessment/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>].

Based on information entered by the clinician, the calculator suggests observation or delivery. The algorithm on which the calculator is based has been reported to facilitate earlier recognition of some, but not all, FHR tracings associated with metabolic acidemia without increasing the rate of operative intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fetal-heart-rate-assessment/abstract/18,90\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,90</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The performance of the calculator has not been assessed in a clinical trial.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two randomized trials (FM-ALERT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fetal-heart-rate-assessment/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>] and INFANT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fetal-heart-rate-assessment/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]) have evaluated the use of continuous intrapartum fetal monitoring with computerized interpretation and real-time alerts.

Compared with usual care, the intervention did not increase recognition of abnormal FHR patterns, did not increase the rate of spontaneous vaginal delivery, and did not improve neonatal outcome (composite or individual endpoints such as pH &lt;7.05, metabolic acidosis, seizures, neonatal encephalopathy, hospital stay). Developmental assessment at age two years was similar for both groups.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3840714325\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTROVERSIAL THEORIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is clear consensus that normal intrapartum FHR monitoring, when accompanied by normal Apgar scores, normal umbilical artery blood gas results, or both, is inconsistent with an acute intrapartum hypoxic-ischemic event sufficient to cause hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy (HIE) and cerebral palsy (CP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fetal-heart-rate-assessment/abstract/19,97\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,97</a>]. Intrapartum HIE that is sufficient to cause CP requires significant interruption of fetal oxygenation, usually manifested by significant FHR abnormalities (eg, category III tracing), metabolic acidemia (reflected by low umbilical artery pH and elevated base deficit), and immediate newborn depression (usually reflected by low Apgar scores). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-neonatal-encephalopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and pathogenesis of neonatal encephalopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Contrary to this consensus, one group has proposed that the standard markers of intrapartum fetal hypoxia described above need not be present in order to establish that an intrapartum event was the cause of later neurologic impairment and that impairment can be due to the effects of mechanical forces of labor on the fetal head [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fetal-heart-rate-assessment/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>]. Although mechanical forces of labor cause pressure on the fetal head, injury by this hypothetical mechanism has no scientific basis: It has never been reported, and a 2017 systematic review concluded that fetal intracranial pressure is well protected from extracranial forces and available data do not support intrapartum extracranial pressure as a cause of fetal brain injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fetal-heart-rate-assessment/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>]. </p><p>Another group has proposed a risk-scoring system, dubbed the &quot;Fetal Reserve Index (FRI),&quot; for interpretation and management of FHR patterns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intrapartum-fetal-heart-rate-assessment/abstract/100-102\" class=\"abstract_t\">100-102</a>]. The FRI is a weighted calculation of eight risk categories, including 10 maternal risk factors (eg, chronic debilitating disease, short stature), 9 obstetric risk factors (eg, placental abruption, malpresentation), and 12 fetal risk factors (eg, meconium passage, chorioamnionitis). Their criteria for abnormal FHR patterns and uterine activity are defined differently from standard National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and international definitions. This system has never been validated; furthermore, the authors&rsquo; lack of standard criteria for diagnosing cases of HIE, lack of appropriate controls, and multiple obvious sources of potential bias preclude reasonably founded conclusions regarding safety or utility of the FRI.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H139235489\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

There is some evidence that intrapartum fetal monitoring is associated with a reduction in intrapartum death. However, conclusive evidence of a reduction in long-term neurologic impairment is lacking. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Does intrapartum FHR monitoring improve outcome?'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electronic fetal monitoring has a high false-positive rate for predicting adverse neonatal outcomes and may increase the rate of operative delivery.

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Does intrapartum FHR monitoring improve outcome?'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two commonly used modalities for intrapartum FHR monitoring are continuous electronic FHR monitoring and intermittent auscultation. Contemporary evidence indicates that neither test performs better than the other, provided that intermittent auscultation is performed as prescribed in randomized trials. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Does intrapartum FHR monitoring improve outcome?'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4230002941\" class=\"local\">'Continuous monitoring versus intermittent auscultation: Recommendations of selected national organizations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicolegal precedent in the United States mandates some form of intrapartum FHR monitoring. For most high-risk pregnant women, continuous electronic FHR monitoring is recommended. For low-risk women, either intermittent or continuous electronic FHR monitoring is reasonable, but frequent intermittent monitoring is cumbersome and difficult for most institutional nursing services to achieve. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Candidates for intrapartum fetal monitoring'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4230002941\" class=\"local\">'Continuous monitoring versus intermittent auscultation: Recommendations of selected national organizations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intrapartum FHR monitoring is usually not performed when detection of a FHR abnormality would not prompt any intervention (eg, conservative maneuvers to improve fetal oxygenation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cesarean delivery).
