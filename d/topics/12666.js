Management of men with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) involves the sequential use of these approaches, with the goals of prolonging survival, minimizing complications, and maintaining quality of life.</p><p>Treatment options for patients with CRPC and the proper sequencing of the approaches are presented here. </p><p>The management of men with castration-sensitive prostate cancer is discussed separately.

However, some men with prostate cancer have overt metastases either at presentation or as their first sign of recurrence following definitive therapy. In the vast majority of cases, such metastases are predominantly osteoblastic lesions in the axial skeleton; such metastases may vary from asymptomatic to symptomatic.</p><p>Systemic therapy options for men in whom the only evidence of disseminated disease is an elevated PSA are the same as those for men with overt metastases.

For those whose disease is manifested only by an elevated serum PSA, the natural history of disease may be very prolonged, which has significant implications for the timing and choice of therapy.

The presence of CRPC does not imply that disease is totally independent of androgens and resistant to further therapies directed at blocking androgen stimulation. (See <a href=\"#H3593183340\" class=\"local\">'Castration resistance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For men with CRPC, we suggest that androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) be continued while additional systemic therapy is being used (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2013946805\" class=\"local\">'Continuation of ADT'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with advanced prostate cancer whose initial hormonal therapy included both a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist and an antiandrogen, we suggest withdrawing the antiandrogen and observing for evidence of response before initiating an alternative systemic therapy treatment (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alternative-endocrine-therapies-for-castration-resistant-prostate-cancer#H442096182\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Alternative endocrine therapies for castration-resistant prostate cancer&quot;, section on 'Antiandrogen withdrawal'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subsequent systemic therapy for CRPC should sequentially incorporate modalities that have been demonstrated to improve overall survival; the choice of a specific therapy should be guided by patient-specific factors, as well as the patient population studied in clinical trials (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F85716\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85716 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H129375075\" class=\"local\">'Systemic therapy options'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Factors that should be considered in choosing a specific therapy include the site and extent of disease, rate of disease progression, symptomatology, comorbidities, regulatory status and availability of the modality, side effects of the treatment, and contraindications. Potential options include interference with androgenic stimulation of tumor growth (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=abiraterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abiraterone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enzalutamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">enzalutamide</a>), cellular immunotherapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sipuleucel-t-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sipuleucel-T</a>, taxane chemotherapy (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=docetaxel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">docetaxel</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cabazitaxel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cabazitaxel</a>), and the bone-targeting radioisotope <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radium-223-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">radium-223</a>. (See <a href=\"#H129375075\" class=\"local\">'Systemic therapy options'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Older approaches that may have a role in selected cases include antiandrogens, antiandrogen withdrawal, suppression of adrenal steroidogenesis with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketoconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketoconazole</a> or steroids, estrogens, and progesterones. (See <a href=\"#H2271887436\" class=\"local\">'Other endocrine approaches'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alternative-endocrine-therapies-for-castration-resistant-prostate-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Alternative endocrine therapies for castration-resistant prostate cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Osteoblastic lesions in the axial skeleton are the predominant site of metastases in the majority of cases. For men with bone metastases, the use of an osteoclast inhibitor is an important adjunct to systemic therapy to reduce the risk of skeletal complications (pathologic fracture, epidural spinal cord compression). In addition, external beam radiation or radiopharmaceuticals may provide important symptom palliation for men with severe pain at one or more sites due to bone metastases.
