The prevention (whether primary or secondary) and treatment of CAD are generally similar in patients with and without RA, but are influenced by factors particular to RA and similar disorders. Efforts have been made to try to quantify the increase in risk in patients with RA, which results from multiple interacting factors (See <a href=\"#H145323642\" class=\"local\">'Risk estimation'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coronary-artery-disease-in-rheumatoid-arthritis-pathogenesis-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-implications#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coronary artery disease in rheumatoid arthritis: Pathogenesis, risk factors, clinical manifestations, and diagnostic implications&quot;, section on 'Pathogenesis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=coronary-artery-disease-in-rheumatoid-arthritis-pathogenesis-risk-factors-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnostic-implications#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Coronary artery disease in rheumatoid arthritis: Pathogenesis, risk factors, clinical manifestations, and diagnostic implications&quot;, section on 'Risk factors'</a>.)</p><p>Some issues of particular concern in RA that may affect cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Effects of systemic inflammation on CAD</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Issues related to concomitant use of low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> with nonaspirin nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as nonselective NSAIDs or cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 selective inhibitors</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Benefits and adverse effects of glucocorticoids and other RA therapies, including nonbiologic and biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs)</p><p/><p>Screening for cardiovascular disease is discussed separately.

Qrisk2, a general-population CV risk calculator applied in the United Kingdom [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-disease-in-rheumatoid-arthritis-implications-for-prevention-and-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], was found to overestimate CV risk in a cohort of RA patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-disease-in-rheumatoid-arthritis-implications-for-prevention-and-management/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. There are insufficient data to guide tailoring of treatment targets based on rheumatologic disease status, other than the evidence that patients with rheumatologic and inflammatory disorders, including RA, are at greater risk than the general population.</p><p>A method for risk adjustment in patients with RA has been proposed by the EULAR expert panel, which they suggest may be used in patients fulfilling at least two of the following three criteria: a positive rheumatoid factor <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibody, disease duration greater than 10 years, and extraarticular disease manifestations. In such patients, the panel suggested multiplying commonly used risk calculators, such as the Systematic COronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE) method (often used in Europe) or the Framingham risk model (often used in the United States), by a factor of 1.5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-disease-in-rheumatoid-arthritis-implications-for-prevention-and-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>However, the EULAR recommendation for use of the multiplier was based upon expert opinion, without validation in multiple cohorts, and we do not use it in clinical practice as a basis for making treatment decisions. The use of multivariate risk models for the estimation of cardiovascular risk in individual patients is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiovascular-disease-risk-assessment-for-primary-prevention-our-approach\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiovascular disease risk assessment for primary prevention: Our approach&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Another method developed for CV risk estimation specifically for RA patients is the expanded CV risk prediction score for RA (ERS-RA). The score includes four RA-related variables that contributed, together with traditional risk factors, to more accurate risk estimation compared with the use of traditional risk factors alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-disease-in-rheumatoid-arthritis-implications-for-prevention-and-management/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. These included disease activity (Clinical Disease Activity Index &gt;10 versus &le;10), disability (modified Health Assessment Questionnaire disability index &gt;0.5 versus &le;0.5), daily <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> use (any versus none), and disease duration (&ge;10 versus &lt;10 years). Although developed and internally validated using data from a large North American registry, the model requires external validation; however, the data confirm and reinforce the importance of taking into account RA-specific clinical factors in addition to traditional risk when estimating CV risk.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">General prevention measures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We recommend a primary prevention strategy in patients with RA that is comparable to that widely recommended in the general population to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events and cardiovascular deaths, consistent with expert guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-disease-in-rheumatoid-arthritis-implications-for-prevention-and-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H145323454\" class=\"local\">'Blood pressure control'</a> below and <a href=\"#H145323534\" class=\"local\">'Exercise'</a> below and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Lipid lowering with statins'</a> below and <a href=\"#H145323261\" class=\"local\">'Low-dose aspirin'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H145323454\"><span class=\"h3\">Blood pressure control</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blood pressure in patients with RA may be increased to a modest degree by several of the medications used to treat the arthritic disorder, including NSAIDs (both nonselective and COX-2-selective), glucocorticoids, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leflunomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leflunomide</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-disease-in-rheumatoid-arthritis-implications-for-prevention-and-management/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Thus, for those in whom these agents are necessary, monitoring blood pressure before and after starting such medications, with initiation or adjustment of antihypertensive therapy to maintain optimal blood pressure control, is suggested as a means of reducing the risk of CVD. Early initiation of DMARDs in most patients may avoid the need for regular use of NSAIDs and reduce the need for glucocorticoids.

High-intensity weightbearing exercises may not be appropriate for patients with preexisting structural damage of lower extremity joints. Less intense or non-weightbearing exercises are alternatives for such patients.

There is widespread agreement that clinicians should have a high degree of alertness to monitor patients with RA for CVD and to manage risk factors aggressively. The use of statins for lipid management in the primary and secondary prevention of CVD is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-elevated-low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol-ldl-c-in-primary-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of elevated low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) in primary prevention of cardiovascular disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol-ldl-c-in-secondary-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Given the low rate of serious side effects from statins, their capacity to reduce lipids and cardiovascular risk, and evidence of antiinflammatory effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-disease-in-rheumatoid-arthritis-implications-for-prevention-and-management/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], it may be reasonable to have a lower threshold for initiating these drugs in patients with active RA than in those without the disease. However, despite these potential benefits, their use should not be considered a substitute either for cardiovascular risk factor modification through lifestyle changes and other interventions or for use of indicated DMARDs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-disease-in-rheumatoid-arthritis-implications-for-prevention-and-management/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Although relatively limited data are available concerning the efficacy and safety of statins in patients with RA, one population-based cohort study of patients with RA receiving DMARD therapy found that all-cause mortality was reduced 21 percent in patients receiving statins compared with similar patients not on these agents (hazard ratio 0.79, 95% CI 0.68-0.91; absolute mortality risk of 32.6 versus 42.<span class=\"nowrap\">6/1000</span> patient-years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-disease-in-rheumatoid-arthritis-implications-for-prevention-and-management/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. These benefits were similar to those seen in randomized trials in the general population. Another study demonstrating benefits for cardiovascular disease in patients with RA, as well as other inflammatory joint diseases, found that intensive statin therapy (with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rosuvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rosuvastatin</a>) induced atherosclerotic regression in carotid plaque and significantly reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-disease-in-rheumatoid-arthritis-implications-for-prevention-and-management/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanisms-of-benefit-of-lipid-lowering-drugs-in-patients-with-coronary-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanisms of benefit of lipid-lowering drugs in patients with coronary heart disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Despite its recognition as an emerging risk factor for CAD, RA is not considered a class I indication for lipid lowering as a primary prevention strategy for CVD in the United States. Some experts have proposed that the diagnosis of RA may constitute a risk equivalent similar to type 2 diabetes mellitus and that patients with RA should routinely be placed on lipid-lowering therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-disease-in-rheumatoid-arthritis-implications-for-prevention-and-management/abstract/11,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,14</a>]. This issue remains controversial, as statins are not free of side effects, and their effect in slowing progression of atherosclerosis in RA has not been adequately tested. Despite the lack of recognition of RA as a formal risk factor for CAD, lipid lowering with a statin can be an effective primary prevention strategy for CVD in selected patients in the general population, including healthy individuals with normal lipid levels and an elevated serum C-reactive protein (CRP). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-primary-prevention-of-coronary-heart-disease-and-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of primary prevention of coronary heart disease and stroke&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There is limited evidence for an antiinflammatory effect of statins in RA. A randomized trial involving 116 patients examined the lipid-lowering and antiinflammatory efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atorvastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atorvastatin</a> in patients with active RA and a mean serum LDL cholesterol levels of approximately 125 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (3.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-disease-in-rheumatoid-arthritis-implications-for-prevention-and-management/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Treatment with atorvastatin (40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> was well-tolerated and was associated with significantly greater reductions in LDL cholesterol levels compared with placebo (54 versus 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [1.4 versus 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L])</span> and in markers of inflammation such as serum CRP, the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and indices of disease activity such as the disease activity score in 28 joints (DAS28). However, the trial was not designed to assess cardiovascular outcomes, and further research is required to determine whether statins may have a role in treating joint inflammation in patients with RA or whether statin therapy should be used solely to improve cardiovascular outcomes in patients with RA who do not have traditional cardiovascular risk factors. Additional trials testing the effects of statins on cardiovascular endpoints in patients with RA are needed. These trials will need to address the relationship between disease activity, lipid levels, inflammation, and cardiovascular risk in RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronary-artery-disease-in-rheumatoid-arthritis-implications-for-prevention-and-management/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H145323261\"><span class=\"h3\">Low-dose aspirin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> in patients with RA for cardiovascular prevention does not differ from patients in the general population without RA, but may affect the use of NSAIDs employed for treating the arthritis.
