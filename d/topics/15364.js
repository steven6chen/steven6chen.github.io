People get the infection from foods that contain the bacteria. People can also get the infection from touching certain animals, such as chickens, ducks, and turtles.</p><p>Salmonella infection is common. It is not serious for most people. But sometimes the bacteria get into the bloodstream. If this happens, people with certain conditions could get very sick. These include people with:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AIDS &ndash; This is an illness that makes the body's infection-fighting system, called the &quot;immune system,&quot; very weak.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cancer &ndash; People who recently had a treatment called &quot;chemotherapy&quot; have a higher risk of getting very sick.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sickle cell disease &ndash; This is an illness that affects the red blood cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An organ transplant (such as a new heart, lung, or kidney)</p><p/><p>Other people who can get very sick include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>People taking high doses of steroid medicines or other medicines that weaken the immune system</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Babies who were born too early or with immune system problems</p><p/><p>If you have heart disease or a man-made joint, there is a small chance that salmonella bacteria will attach to your blood vessels or the man-made joint. This could make you sicker than most people.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14463118\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of salmonella infection?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea or vomiting</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever &ndash; This usually lasts 2 or 3 days.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diarrhea that can be watery or bloody &ndash; This usually lasts 4 to 10 days. If you have diarrhea for more than 10 days, a different condition could be causing your symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Belly pain</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14463133\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>See your doctor or nurse if you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have severe belly pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cannot eat or drink</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vomit blood or have blood in your bowel movements</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have a fever higher than 100.4&deg;F (38&deg;C)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14463148\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for salmonella infection?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor or nurse can order tests on a sample of your bowel movement to check for salmonella bacteria. But it can take 2 or 3 days to get the test results. If you have a high risk of getting very sick from salmonella infection, your doctor or nurse might not wait for your test results before starting treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14463163\"><span class=\"h1\">How is salmonella infection treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It usually goes away on its own, so most people do not need treatment. But if you get very sick, you might be treated in the hospital. Doctors can give antibiotics through an &quot;IV,&quot; a thin tube that goes into a vein.</p><p>If you have a high risk of getting very sick from salmonella infection, your doctor might prescribe antibiotic pills. You might need them for 2 weeks or even several months. The antibiotics help get rid of the infection and keep it from coming back.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14463178\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes.
