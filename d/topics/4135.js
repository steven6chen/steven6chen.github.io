Because of the molecular and structural differences between dronedarone and amiodarone, in particular the deletion of the iodine molecules which are present in amiodarone, researchers have hypothesized that dronedarone will have fewer thyroid and pulmonary effects than amiodarone. Clinical trials have shown the clinical use and short-term safety (up to 21 months) of dronedarone for the maintenance of sinus rhythm following cardioversion in patients with AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-uses-of-dronedarone/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The efficacy and tolerability of dronedarone in children and adolescents aged &lt;18 years have not been established.</p><p>A review of the pharmacology of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dronedarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dronedarone</a>, its clinical uses, adverse effects, and drug interactions will be presented here. The clinical uses and toxicities of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> and the choice of antiarrhythmic agents in the management of AF are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-uses-of-amiodarone\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical uses of amiodarone&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-monitoring-and-management-of-side-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Amiodarone: Monitoring and management of side effects&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antiarrhythmic-drugs-to-maintain-sinus-rhythm-in-patients-with-atrial-fibrillation-recommendations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antiarrhythmic drugs to maintain sinus rhythm in patients with atrial fibrillation: Recommendations&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17494085\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISMS OF ACTION AND PHARMACOKINETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dronedarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Dronedarone</a> is a class III antiarrhythmic agent and a potent blocker of multiple intracardiac ion channels with many electrophysiological properties in common with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56600\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56600 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-uses-of-dronedarone/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Like amiodarone, dronedarone has antiadrenergic (ie, beta blocking) properties and inhibits multiple transmembrane potassium currents, including the delayed rectifier current, the ultra-rapid delayed rectifier current, the inward rectifier current, and the transient outward current. In addition, dronedarone blocks inward depolarizing sodium and L-type calcium currents. </p><p>Limited pharmacokinetic data are available for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dronedarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dronedarone</a> and are derived primarily from data in the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) prescribing information and from data in the FDA briefing document [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-uses-of-dronedarone/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Dronedarone is approximately 70 to 94 percent absorbed after oral administration, but its absolute bioavailability is only approximately 15 percent due to significant first pass metabolism. Peak plasma concentrations are achieved within three to six hours. However, there is a significant food effect which increases plasma dronedarone concentrations between two- and threefold when the drug is taken with<sup> </sup>food [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-uses-of-dronedarone/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Following the initiation of dronedarone 400 mg twice daily, steady-state plasma concentrations<sup> </sup>are reached within four to eight days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-uses-of-dronedarone/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The clearance of<sup> </sup><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dronedarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dronedarone</a> is principally nonrenal, with a terminal half-life<sup> </sup>of approximately 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-uses-of-dronedarone/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This is markedly shorter than the half-life of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a>, which has an effective half-life of up to 50 days. Dronedarone is highly bound to plasma proteins and is not associated with significant tissue accumulation. Therefore, it has been postulated that systemic side effects secondary to long-term usage of the drug, such as liver toxicity, pulmonary fibrosis, or thyroid dysfunction will be minimized in comparison to amiodarone. However, long-term toxicity data are not yet available.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dronedarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Dronedarone</a> has been shown to increase serum creatinine by 10 to 15 percent, a change which appears to resolve once the drug is discontinued [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-uses-of-dronedarone/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. A phase I trial of dronedarone (400 mg twice daily for seven days) in 12 healthy males reported a decrease in creatinine clearance of 18 percent (compared with placebo) without adverse effects on glomerular filtration rate or renal plasma flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-uses-of-dronedarone/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Partial inhibition of tubular organic cation transporters has been suggested as a mechanism to explain the decrease in creatinine clearance. </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dronedarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Dronedarone</a> reduced the rate of stroke and transient ischemic attack in patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) in the ATHENA trial, with some suggestion that this cannot be explained by its antiarrhythmic effect alone and may involve alternative mechanisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-uses-of-dronedarone/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In a report of patient samples from the ATHENA trial, dronedarone exerted direct inhibitory effects on parameters of hemostasis and platelet reactivity at plasma concentrations typically achieved after routine clinical dosing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-uses-of-dronedarone/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. These actions appear to be independent of the drug's antiarrhythmic properties and suggest a previously unknown pleiotropic effect. The active metabolite of dronedarone, SR35021A, demonstrates direct anticoagulant and antiplatelet effects&nbsp;in&nbsp;vitro&nbsp;at plasma concentrations typically achieved during conventional therapeutic dosing. These antithrombotic effects are likely to have contributed to the reported beneficial effects of dronedarone on ischemic events in patients with paroxysmal AF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-uses-of-dronedarone/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Further studies are needed to better understand the mechanisms involved and to gauge the magnitude of these pleiotropic effects of dronedarone in patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17494101\"><span class=\"h1\">METABOLISM AND DRUG INTERACTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dronedarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dronedarone</a> 400 mg twice daily (taken with morning and evening meals) is approved for the maintenance of normal sinus rhythm in patients with a history of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. Dronedarone is metabolized by the CYP3A4 system in the liver and has many potential drug interactions. As dronedarone primarily undergoes hepatic metabolism, its clearance may also be altered in patients with hepatic impairment. No dose adjustment is required in patients with renal insufficiency.</p><p>The pharmacokinetics of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dronedarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dronedarone</a> in patients with severe hepatic impairment have not been assessed; however, administration of dronedarone to patients with severe hepatic impairment is contraindicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-uses-of-dronedarone/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Currently, there are no dose adjustment recommendations for patients with moderate hepatic impairment; however, data provided from the manufacturer indicate that patients with moderate hepatic impairment achieve higher dronedarone values with the potential to rise to supra-therapeutic concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-uses-of-dronedarone/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Although no statistically significant between-group difference in dronedarone exposure was observed in patients with moderate hepatic impairment and healthy volunteers who both received dronedarone 400 mg twice daily for seven days, patients with moderate hepatic impairment exhibited numerically higher dronedarone exposure values and a highly variable coefficient of variation (&gt;70 percent), indicating the potential for supra-therapeutic concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-uses-of-dronedarone/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Dronedarone has many electrophysiological properties in common with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a>, including its antiadrenergic (ie, beta blocking) properties and the ability to inhibit multiple transmembrane potassium, sodium, and calcium currents. (See <a href=\"#H17494085\" class=\"local\">'Mechanisms of action and pharmacokinetics'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-uses-of-amiodarone\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical uses of amiodarone&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In contrast to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a>, which has an effective half-life of up to 50 days, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dronedarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dronedarone</a> has a half-life<sup> </sup>of approximately 24 hours. In addition, dronedarone is highly bound to plasma proteins and is not associated with the significant tissue accumulation seen with amiodarone. Therefore, it has been postulated that systemic side effects secondary to long-term usage of the drug, such as liver toxicity, pulmonary fibrosis, or thyroid dysfunction will be minimized in comparison to amiodarone. However, long-term toxicity data are not yet available. (See <a href=\"#H17494085\" class=\"local\">'Mechanisms of action and pharmacokinetics'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-monitoring-and-management-of-side-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Amiodarone: Monitoring and management of side effects&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because of its hepatic metabolism, there are numerous potential drug interactions with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dronedarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dronedarone</a>. Concomitant use of dronedarone with some medications (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketoconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ketoconazole</a>, class I antiarrhythmic drugs) is contraindicated, while its use with other medications (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>, statins) may require dose adjustment.

However, dronedarone may be preferred in certain patient populations.

Hepatic function testing should be performed at the time of dronedarone initiation and repeated once or twice within the first six months and yearly thereafter. An electrocardiogram should be performed annually and at the time of any clinical change (ie, recurrent arrhythmia). (See <a href=\"#H17494713\" class=\"local\">'Maintenance of sinus rhythm'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dronedarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Dronedarone</a> should <strong>NOT</strong> be prescribed exclusively as a rate control medication given the availability of other agents for this purpose and the results of the PALLAS trial, which demonstrated an increase in cardiovascular mortality when dronedarone was used solely as a rate controlling agent. (See <a href=\"#H17494777\" class=\"local\">'Ventricular rate control in AF'</a> above and <a href=\"#H752786\" class=\"local\">'Effect on cardiovascular mortality'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dronedarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Dronedarone</a> is only rarely effective for the chemical cardioversion of AF or atrial flutter to sinus rhythm (less than 10 percent of patients). As such, dronedarone should <strong>NOT</strong> be used for this purpose. However, as there is a potential for cardioversion during drug initiation, standard precautions should be taken to minimize the risk of thromboembolic events (ie, therapeutic anticoagulation for at least three weeks or a transesophageal echocardiogram for assessment of left atrial thrombus). (See <a href=\"#H17494720\" class=\"local\">'Chemical cardioversion of AF'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dronedarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Dronedarone</a> is usually well tolerated. Common side effects include crampy abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea, and rash. Rare but potentially life-threatening side effects include heart failure, QT prolongation, and liver toxicity. Preliminary unpublished data from the PALLAS trial show an increased risk of cardiovascular events including death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and systemic embolism when dronedarone was administered to patients with chronic AF. There is a paucity of data regarding potential long-term side effects. Liver and lung toxicity have been reported, and routine surveillance for these adverse events is recommended. (See <a href=\"#H155067\" class=\"local\">'Adverse effects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients who have developed recurrent AF despite antiarrhythmic therapy, it may be necessary to switch antiarrhythmic drugs. Because of the potential for QT prolongation and torsades de pointes, concomitant use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dronedarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dronedarone</a> and class I or III antiarrhythmic drugs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56600\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56600 \">table 1</a>) that prolong the QT interval is contraindicated, and at least five half-lives should be allowed between changes in antiarrhythmic agents with the exception of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a>. While there are no specific recommendations concerning the transition from amiodarone to dronedarone, dronedarone can usually be started immediately after amiodarone discontinuation unless there is clinically significant bradycardia or QT prolongation.
