SUI occurs when an increase in intraabdominal pressure exceeds urethral closure pressure, resulting in the involuntary leakage of urine. This may occur with exertion, sneezing, or coughing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-transobturator-midurethral-slings/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>Management options for SUI include conservative and surgical treatments. Midurethral slings are a relatively new treatment option, but have become the procedure of choice for many women. The first midurethral sling, introduced in 1996, was placed by passing trocars with mesh through the retropubic space [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-transobturator-midurethral-slings/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Retropubic midurethral slings are still commonly used, but transobturator slings were introduced in 2001 with the goal of avoiding some of the complications of retropubic insertion (eg, bladder perforation, vascular injury, bowel injury) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-transobturator-midurethral-slings/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Transobturator slings are placed by passing trocars with mesh through obturator canal and avoiding the retropubic space completely. </p><p>Transobturator midurethral sling procedures are reviewed here. Retropubic midurethral slings and the approach to choosing a procedure for SUI in women are discussed separately.

These procedures vary by the location of the sling and by the sling material. Collectively, these slings are referred to as suburethral slings, which is a sling that is inserted through a small vaginal incision and attached to another structure in the pelvis for the purpose of supporting the urethra. Suburethral slings may be either bladder neck and midurethral slings.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Midurethral sling &ndash; A suburethral sling that is placed at the level of the midurethra in a tension-free manner. These slings are made of synthetic mesh.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Retropubic midurethral slings</strong> (eg, tension-free vaginal tape [TVT]) are inserted through the retropubic space and exit through the abdominal wall in the suprapubic area (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F59114\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59114 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Transobturator midurethral slings</strong> are inserted through the two obturator foramens and exit through the skin of the groin area (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F52240\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52240 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Single incision midurethral slings </strong>(eg, MiniArc) differ from full-length retropubic and transobturator slings in two ways: they are shorter (approximately 8 cm rather than 40 cm) and they require only a vaginal incision, and not an abdominal incision. Different types of these slings may be placed in a retropubic (anchored to the urogenital diaphragm) or transobturator fashion (anchored to the obturator internus muscle).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bladder neck sling &ndash; A suburethral sling that is placed at the level of the proximal urethra and bladder neck (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F76965\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76965 \">figure 3</a>). This procedure is usually performed using both vaginal and abdominal incisions. These slings can be made of either biologic materials (including the patient's own tissue) or synthetic mesh. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Bladder neck slings are also referred to as proximal urethral slings. Alternatively, they are referred to as pubovaginal slings when the arms of the sling material are affixed to the anterior rectus fascia rather than the pubic bone or Cooper's ligament [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-transobturator-midurethral-slings/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H941616\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF ACTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Midurethral slings involve the introduction of a polypropylene tape (approximately 1 cm in width) covered in a plastic sheath beneath the midportion of the urethra. Transobturator slings, similar to their retropubic counterpart, function as a backboard, which offers resistance beneath the urethra during increases in intraabdominal pressure, but not at rest. Ultrasound data suggest that continence is achieved by compression of the urethra between the sling and the pubic symphysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-transobturator-midurethral-slings/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p>In transobturator procedures, the sling traverses the skin in the groin, the obturator foramen, posterior to the adductor longus tendon, and a midurethral vaginal incision (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F52240\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52240 \">figure 2</a>). The sling lies under the midportion of the urethra at a less acute angle than the retropubic technique and is, therefore, thought to be less likely to cause obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-transobturator-midurethral-slings/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Once the plastic sheaths are removed, the tape is held in place without suture by its interface with the patient&rsquo;s tissue. The friction which initially secures the mesh is eventually reinforced with tissue fibrosis into the mesh. Porcine models demonstrate that 74 percent of the final strength has already been achieved by two weeks postoperatively and maximum strength of tissue in-growth into polypropylene mesh occurs at three months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-transobturator-midurethral-slings/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H941728\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGICAL CANDIDATES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1196142\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications and special considerations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Indications and special considerations are the same for transobturator as for retropubic midurethral slings.

Plans for future pregnancy are a relative contraindication. Since pelvic support may be disrupted during pregnancy, and particularly following a vaginal birth, most physicians recommend delaying surgical management of SUI until childbearing has been completed.

The risk of hematoma formation is probably more with retropubic approaches than with transobturator approaches, so women with bleeding diatheses (eg, Von Willebrand&rsquo;s) may be better served with administration of preoperative control measures (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=desmopressin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">desmopressin</a>) and a transobturator approach.</p><p>Preexisting synthetic mesh in the path of trocar placement may result in difficulty with proper sling placement, but a previous midurethral sling is not a contraindication to placement of another midurethral sling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-transobturator-midurethral-slings/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

However, this analysis was limited by insufficient statistical power.</p><p>One disadvantage of the outside-in approach is that it results in a larger vaginal incision and has a higher rate of vaginal perforation (in a trial of 341 women, 17 versus 3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-transobturator-midurethral-slings/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]), based upon data from randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-transobturator-midurethral-slings/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. On the other hand, some data suggest that the inside-out approach is more likely to cause groin pain, but this finding has varied across studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-transobturator-midurethral-slings/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. One possible explanation for a higher incidence of postoperative pain with the inside-out approach is based upon a cadaveric study, which found that the trocars of the TVT-O device were passed closer to nerves and vessels than the TOT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-transobturator-midurethral-slings/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>In our practice, we perform the inside-out procedure, because it requires small incisions and is also easier to teach to trainees.

Injection in the vaginal sulci through the vagina is another adaptation that has been reported; some surgeons aggressively hydrodissect the anterior vaginal sulci to displace the sulci posteriorly to theoretically reduce the risk of vaginal perforation.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H281890\"><span class=\"h2\">Sling placement</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12261838\"><span class=\"h3\">Inside-out</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are multiple different products on the market that utilize similar techniques.

Place Allis clamps on the lateral edges of the incision to provide exposure by retracting the vaginal mucosa laterally.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The inside-out technique may be performed with smaller incisions, since a finger does not need to be introduced into the tract, as it does for an outside-in technique.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dissecting the tract for the trocar and mesh</strong> &ndash; Use the Metzenbaum scissors to perform a minimal dissection lateral to the midurethra, between the vaginal mucosa and the pubocervical fascia. The scissors are aimed towards the obturator foramen behind the inferior pubic ramus. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A winged guide (provided in the TVT Transobturator kit) can then be introduced into the tract to guide the trocars into the obturator region. Many surgeons use the winged guide to perforate the obturator membrane.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Inserting the trocars </strong>&ndash; Insert the trocars through the obturator foramen, posterior and medial to the obturator vessels. The trocars traverse the periurethral endopelvic fascia, obturator internus muscle, obturator membrane, obturator externus muscle, and exit out through the skin. The trocar should pass just posterior to the adductor longus tendon. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Trocars should be passed while hugging the pubic rami. The obturator canal (obturator nerve and vessels) is located at the opposite, anterolateral margin of the obturator foramen, approximately 3.5 to 4.0 cm lateral to the zone of safe needle passage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-transobturator-midurethral-slings/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Exit through the marked groin incisions, 2 cm lateral to the genitofemoral folds at the level of the clitoris.

Although the risk of bladder perforation is lower than in retropubic sling procedures, bladder and urethral perforations have been reported for transobturator procedures. The morbidity of the urinary tract injury is reduced with intraoperative recognition and appropriate repositioning of the trocar. (See <a href=\"#H492568\" class=\"local\">'Bladder or urethral injury'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A 70 degree cystoscope should be used and the bladder filled adequately to allow complete examination of the urethra and bladder surface [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-transobturator-midurethral-slings/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Adjusting sling tension</strong> &ndash; To ensure that the sling is tension-free and does not compress the urethra while the patient is at rest, many surgeons insert an instrument (eg, Kelly clamp, needle driver, number 8 Hegar dilator) between the sling and the urethra while adjusting the sling tension.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">An intraoperative urinary (cough) stress test may be performed at this time if the patient is under local anesthesia. If leakage occurs, the sling is tightened slightly. Performing the urinary stress test during sling placement is discussed separately.

The surgeon should assess the entire plastic sheath to confirm that it has been completely removed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Trim the mesh at the groin incisions.

We perform abdominal and vaginal examinations to ensure that the incisions have adequately healed and to check for vaginal mesh erosion.

We check a postvoid residual volume to assess whether the patient has been adequately emptying her bladder.

Midurethral sling placement is the procedure of choice for treatment of SUI in many women. Midurethral sling can be placed either through the retropubic or transobturator spaces. (See <a href=\"#H12261729\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contraindications for transobturator midurethral sling placement include current pregnancy or urinary tract infection. Plans for a future pregnancy are a relative contraindication. (See <a href=\"#H1196420\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are two variations of transobturator midurethral sling procedures: inside-out (trocars are passed from a midurethral vaginal incision to exit through bilateral groin incisions) and outside-in (trocars are passed from bilateral groin incisions to exit through a midurethral vaginal incision). The evidence is insufficient to recommend the choice of one of these procedures rather than the other, and surgeons should use the procedure with which they are most comfortable. (See <a href=\"#H1196365\" class=\"local\">'Choosing a type of transobturator sling'</a> above.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women who are planning primary midurethral transobturator sling placement should undergo preoperative evaluation to confirm the diagnosis of SUI, exclude other etiologies of urinary incontinence, and assess surgical risk. (See <a href=\"#H941851\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative evaluation and preparation'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-preoperative-evaluation-for-a-primary-procedure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of stress urinary incontinence in women: Preoperative evaluation for a primary procedure&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend antibiotic prophylaxis for surgical site infection for midurethral sling placement (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-retropubic-midurethral-slings#H297929\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of stress urinary incontinence in women: Retropubic midurethral slings&quot;, section on 'Antibiotic prophylaxis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest use of local anesthesia with conscious sedation or regional anesthesia rather than general anesthesia for midurethral sling placement (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). General anesthesia may be used if it is strongly preferred by the patient or if it is required for a concomitant procedure. (See <a href=\"#H941851\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative evaluation and preparation'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-retropubic-midurethral-slings#H579368\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of stress urinary incontinence in women: Retropubic midurethral slings&quot;, section on 'Anesthesia'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Common complications of midurethral transobturator sling placement include voiding dysfunction, mesh erosion, or groin pain. (See <a href=\"#H12261852\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Voiding dysfunction following sling placement may be treated initially with bladder catheterization or urethral dilation. Persistent symptoms may require sling release, which may result in recurrent SUI. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-retropubic-midurethral-slings#H22194935\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of stress urinary incontinence in women: Retropubic midurethral slings&quot;, section on 'Postoperative catheter management'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-stress-urinary-incontinence-in-women-retropubic-midurethral-slings#H4702658\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of stress urinary incontinence in women: Retropubic midurethral slings&quot;, section on 'Sling release'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long-term data show an SUI cure rate of approximately 73 percent following transobturator midurethral sling placement.
