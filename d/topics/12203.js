Dental and tongue injuries are discussed separately.

A common mechanism involves a toddler or preschool child falling with an object in the mouth or having an item pushed into their mouth by a playmate or caregiver. Typically reported objects include writing instruments (eg, pen, pencil), toothbrushes, Popsicle sticks, lollipops, eating utensils, and drinking straws [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oropharyngeal-trauma-in-children/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Infrequently, the trauma may result from a blind finger sweep by a caregiver during a choking episode [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oropharyngeal-trauma-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The oropharynx consists of the following structures:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Soft palate, uvula above</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tongue below</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dentition and cheeks anterolaterally</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tonsils and tonsillar pillars posterolaterally</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Posterior pharyngeal wall</p><p/><p>The carotid sheath, which contains the internal carotid artery, internal jugular vein, and vagus nerve, lies immediately posterolateral to the tonsils and tonsillar pillars (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F76329\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76329 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>The retropharyngeal space resides between the vertebral bodies of the cervical spine and the posterior pharynx. The parapharyngeal space describes the region of the neck lateral to the oropharynx and includes the carotid sheath. These potential spaces extend into the mediastinum and, when violated, allow air and bacteria to gain access.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Internal carotid artery injury (ICA)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lateral oropharyngeal injury that is posterior to the molars may compress the ICA against the lateral process of a cervical vertebra, creating an intimal tear (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F76329\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76329 \">figure 1</a>). Thrombus formation at the site of arterial injury can extend up into the anterior and middle cerebral arteries over several hours to several days. During this time period, the patient remains asymptomatic (ie, lucid interval). With progression of the clot, the patient develops symptoms of stroke (eg, contralateral hemiparesis, ipsilateral facial droop, and aphasia). In rare cases, hemorrhagic stroke and death have occurred.</p><p>Alternatively, injury to the ICA may cause a dissecting aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm with similar neurologic sequelae.</p><p>Rarely, ICA injury may cause immediate massive bleeding which requires emergency intubation and neck exploration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Deep neck space infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Seeding of bacteria from the oropharynx into the <span class=\"nowrap\">retropharyngeal/parapharyngeal</span> spaces or introduction of organisms from a retained foreign body may cause retropharyngeal infection and abscess. If unrecognized, the infection may extend into the mediastinum. In addition, infection and thrombosis of the internal jugular vein (ie, Lemierres syndrome or jugular vein suppurative thrombophlebitis) may cause severe neck pain and fever. Any of these infections (eg, retropharyngeal abscess, mediastinitis, jugular vein suppurative thrombophlebitis) may cause severe illness with sepsis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=retropharyngeal-infections-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Retropharyngeal infections in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deep-neck-space-infections#H990947896\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Deep neck space infections&quot;, section on 'Complications'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deep-neck-space-infections#H990948208\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Deep neck space infections&quot;, section on 'Complications'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial evaluation should focus on the mechanism of injury, wound characteristics, and the child's neurologic status. Once these factors are known, then radiograph imaging and management proceed based on the patient's estimated risk of deep structure injury.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mechanism of injury can be graded as mild, moderate, or severe. For example, a 10 kg child who falls slowly from a kneeling position with a rounded object in the mouth is at low risk of serious injury. A 40 kg child who falls while running full speed with a sharpened pencil in the mouth is at higher risk. Oropharyngeal trauma with major sequelae is suggested by the following features:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Focal neurologic changes (internal carotid artery [ICA] injury)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever, neck pain, torticollis, or drooling in a patient presenting more than 24 hours post oropharyngeal trauma (retropharyngeal or other deep neck infection) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deep-neck-space-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Deep neck space infections&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest pain and fever (mediastinitis)</p><p/><p>Oropharyngeal injuries resulting from major trauma (eg, air bag deployment when a child has an object in his or her mouth, gunshot wound) warrant management as zone III penetrating neck injuries with an aggressive approach to airway protection and injury identification (eg, angiography, endoscopy, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> surgical exploration). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penetrating-neck-injuries-initial-evaluation-and-management#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Penetrating neck injuries: Initial evaluation and management&quot;, section on 'Emergency management'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Victims of major trauma require an initial primary survey for life-threatening injuries before the emergency provider focuses on oropharyngeal injury. Rarely, hemorrhage from a major oral laceration compromises the airway and necessitates emergent endotracheal intubation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trauma-management-approach-to-the-unstable-child\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trauma management: Approach to the unstable child&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-difficult-pediatric-airway\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The difficult pediatric airway&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the stable patient, the clinician should focus on wound assessment, associated oropharyngeal injury (eg, dentition, jaw), and neurologic examination.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Wound characteristics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thorough examination of the posterior pharynx in a young child often requires the gentle use of a tongue blade and bite block in conjunction with analgesia as needed. A suction device should be immediately available during the examination. Rarely, sedation or general anesthesia is required to adequately examine the oropharynx in an uncooperative child. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procedural-sedation-in-children-outside-of-the-operating-room\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Procedural sedation in children outside of the operating room&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Careful wound assessment includes the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depth &ndash; Small superficial lacerations or scratches (&lt;2 cm long) with clear wound margins and a visible base are of less concern than puncture wounds with a sharp object (eg, pencil). However, depth of a lesion is often difficult to determine. Injury to deeper structures may be present even with apparently minor wounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oropharyngeal-trauma-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Length &ndash; Lacerations over two centimeters in length or associated with a hanging flap usually need repair, but the location, appearance of the laceration, and whether it seems to &quot;fall back together&quot; is more important than the specific length in deciding whether to close the wound. The decision is important because almost all laceration repairs in this region require general anesthesia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Location &ndash; Lateral wounds, especially of the tonsillar pillars, have a greater risk of ICA injury than midline wounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oropharyngeal-trauma-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Injuries to the soft palate are more associated with potential complications than wounds to the hard palate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Foreign body &ndash; A protruding foreign body or concern for a retained foreign body requires additional imaging to demarcate extent of injury and localize involved anatomic structures.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Associated physical findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Any evidence of focal neurologic deficits on complete neurologic examination should prompt emergent imaging and surgical consultation. Nonspecific findings of lethargy or gait disturbance also warrant aggressive evaluation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F73310\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73310 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Neck auscultation over the common carotid artery may demonstrate a bruit on the side associated with the oropharyngeal laceration.</p><p>The teeth should be examined for fracture, subluxation, and avulsion. Tongue lacerations may also be present. Malocclusion and pain with motion indicate jaw injury. Other clinical manifestations of these injuries are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-dental-injuries-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of dental injuries in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-repair-of-tongue-lacerations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and repair of tongue lacerations&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=jaw-fractures-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Jaw fractures in children&quot;</a>.).</p><p>Trismus and drooling in association with fever suggests a retropharyngeal abscess. Subcutaneous emphysema with crepitance may accompany retropharyngeal trauma with air dissecting into the mediastinum. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deep-neck-space-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Deep neck space infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Oral injuries to the lips or unexplained by the history raise suspicion for physical abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oropharyngeal-trauma-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In addition, caregivers have scratched the posterior pharyngeal wall to produce hematemesis as a form of medical child abuse (Munchausen syndrome by proxy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oropharyngeal-trauma-in-children/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-child-abuse-recognition#H3275964756\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical child abuse: Recognition&quot;, section on 'Oral injuries'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-child-abuse-munchausen-syndrome-by-proxy#H4177211750\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical child abuse (Munchausen syndrome by proxy)&quot;, section on 'Perpetrator actions'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immediately after injury, blood testing (complete blood count [CBC], chemistries) is only indicated if there is significant hemorrhage. In these rare situations, the child should receive a hematocrit, platelet count, type and cross, and coagulation studies (prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, international normalized ratio).</p><p>Patients coming to attention with fever and concern regarding a deep neck infection should undergo a complete blood count with differential and blood culture. Measurement of inflammatory markers (eg, erythrocyte sedimentation rate or C reactive protein) is helpful in suggesting the presence of a serious infection and in monitoring response to treatment in patients with deep neck infections. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=retropharyngeal-infections-in-children#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Retropharyngeal infections in children&quot;, section on 'Laboratory evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiographic imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of imaging is to select those children at increased risk of serious sequelae and to detect foreign bodies. Significant controversy surrounds the approach to radiographic imaging in children with oropharyngeal trauma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F60522\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef60522 \">algorithm 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Approach to diagnosis and management'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Plain radiographs of the neck and chest</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plain radiographs may detect subcutaneous air, pneumomediastinum, retropharyngeal widening from abscess or hematoma, and radiopaque foreign bodies. Patient cooperation is not necessary to obtain an adequate study. However, plain radiographs lack sensitivity relative to computed tomography angiography (CTA) or contrast enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oropharyngeal-trauma-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. For this reason, plain radiographs are not generally recommended, except specifically to exclude a radiopaque retained foreign body.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Carotid ultrasound with oculoplethysmography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some specialists have used serial monitoring of carotid flow with ultrasound as a noninvasive method of observing patients while avoiding ionizing radiation. However, this approach warrants patient hospitalization and requires patient cooperation or sedation. In addition, ultrasound findings may not correlate well with blood vessel injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oropharyngeal-trauma-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Computed tomography angiography (CTA)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Observational studies suggest that CTA has good sensitivity for air and subcutaneous foreign bodies and is superior to plain radiographs in patients with oropharyngeal trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oropharyngeal-trauma-in-children/abstract/2,3,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,9</a>].</p><p>Although data does not exist for children with arterial injury after oropharyngeal trauma, systematic reviews have found that CTA has a variable sensitivity and specificity for detecting posttraumatic carotid artery injury in adults with blunt neck trauma. CTA is inferior to contrast enhanced MRA in noninvasive detection of carotid artery defects in adults. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-carotid-artery-stenosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of carotid artery stenosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Despite questions about its ability to detect ICA injury, CTA is more widely available than contrast enhanced magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) and does not always require general anesthesia. CTA is also noninvasive, although the typical child will require sedation. For these reasons, many otolaryngologists (ear, nose, and throat surgeons) utilize CTA as a primary modality in their diagnostic approach in children with oropharyngeal trauma instead of contrast enhanced MRA. Carotid arterial angiography (CAA) is reserved for patients with neurologic deficit or significant ongoing hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oropharyngeal-trauma-in-children/abstract/2,3,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,9</a>] or a mechanism of injury so severe that it warrants management as zone III penetrating neck injury. If CTA suggests trauma immediately adjacent to the major vascular structures (eg, when the wound track can be seen to project immediately adjacent to the carotid), CAA should usually be obtained. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Carotid artery angiography (CAA)'</a> below.) </p><p>However, the potential for CTA to miss a significant ICA injury remains a concern as does the radiation exposure. Thus, the role of CTA versus contrast enhanced MRA in children with oropharyngeal trauma warrants further study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oropharyngeal-trauma-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Little data exist concerning the use of MRA in children with oropharyngeal trauma. Its use is limited by availability and patient factors, including the need for general anesthesia when used in young children and the inability to image patients with metallic implants.</p><p>In adults, contrast enhanced MRA provides good visualization of carotid artery defects with high sensitivity and specificity relative to digital subtraction intraarterial angiography. Contrast enhanced MRA may be preferable to CTA in the older child who can remain still without the need for general anesthesia. Technological advances that shorten MRA test duration to the point that general anesthesia is unnecessary might favor its use for oropharyngeal trauma in children in the future. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-carotid-artery-stenosis#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of carotid artery stenosis&quot;, section on 'MR angiography'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h3\">Carotid artery angiography (CAA)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Digital subtraction CAA remains the gold standard for radiologic imaging of children with ICA injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oropharyngeal-trauma-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, the risk of complications from this procedure is significant. In adults, CAA has a 4 percent risk of embolic stroke and a 1 percent risk of death. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-carotid-artery-stenosis#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of carotid artery stenosis&quot;, section on 'Conventional cerebral angiography'</a>.)</p><p>CAA is typically reserved for children with neurologic deficit after oropharyngeal trauma, ongoing hemorrhage, a truly major mechanism of injury, or evidence of ICA injury on other imaging (eg, CTA, contrast enhanced MRA). Given the low frequency of these findings, CAA is rarely performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oropharyngeal-trauma-in-children/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Although there are no direct data on this point, the risk of CAA in young children or toddlers is probably correlated with the experience of the center in performing angiography in children. If in doubt as to the risk of the study, the ED physician should discuss directly with the radiologist who will be performing the study.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An observational study over a six year time period from a children's hospital reported that 52 of 107 children with oropharyngeal trauma had a CTA while none had a CAA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oropharyngeal-trauma-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. No neurologic sequelae were reported.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An observational study of 23 children seen over six years at a children's hospital reported that 21 had one or more imaging studies; CTA was performed in 18 children, plain neck radiographs in 9, and CAA in 3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oropharyngeal-trauma-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. CAA followed an abnormal CTA (air near the carotid sheath) in one case and showed vessel spasm without thrombus. CAA was normal in the remaining two children; one was performed despite a normal CTA because of a carotid bruit on examination and the other study was the only imaging performed. No neurologic sequelae were seen.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION AND MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although every emergency clinician encounters oropharyngeal trauma, major complications are rare enough that prospective studies have not been feasible. Recommendations are therefore based on observational studies and expert opinion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oropharyngeal-trauma-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial stabilization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Victims of major trauma require an initial primary survey for life-threatening injuries before the emergency provider focuses on oropharyngeal injury. Rarely, hemorrhage from a major oral laceration compromises the airway and necessitates emergent endotracheal intubation.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penetrating-neck-injuries-initial-evaluation-and-management#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Penetrating neck injuries: Initial evaluation and management&quot;, section on 'Emergency management'</a>.)</p><p>In addition, these patients warrant immediate consultation of an otolaryngologist (ear, nose, and throat surgeon) with pediatric expertise in concert with neurosurgical or vascular surgeons. If capability to manage these patients does not exist at the admitting hospital, then the patient should be stabilized and transferred expeditiously to an appropriate institution. Further treatment is guided by CAA results and may include anticoagulation, surgical exploration of the neck, or carotid thrombus endarterectomy.

Concerning findings on CTA include ICA abnormality, subcutaneous air near the carotid sheath, or significant tissue disruption adjacent to the carotid sheath. MRA shows similar findings but may also have the ability to show ICA injury with greater sensitivity and specificity. Patients with an abnormal CTA or MRA should receive a digital subtraction CAA.

The frequency of operative care is approximately 6 to 11 percent of children with oropharyngeal trauma based on three observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oropharyngeal-trauma-in-children/abstract/3,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,11,12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h3\">Tetanus prophylaxis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oropharyngeal wounds are considered tetanus prone and require tetanus prophylaxis, as needed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61087\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61087 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h3\">Empiric antibiotic therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preliminary evidence suggests that the infection rate is low following oropharyngeal trauma. As an example, in an observational study of 116 children with isolated penetrating palate trauma of whom 67 were prescribed antibiotics, one patient developed an infection within seven days of the injury (infection rate 1 percent [95% CI 0-5 percent]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/oropharyngeal-trauma-in-children/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. However, no trials have evaluated the benefit of prophylactic antibiotics in children with penetrating oropharyngeal trauma, and deep neck infection (eg, retropharyngeal or parapharyngeal abscess) remains a concerning complication for deep wounds.

Rarely, internal carotid artery (ICA) injury or deep space neck infection may complicate oropharyngeal trauma. Key physical findings help categorize oropharyngeal trauma as minor, moderate, or severe (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F80771\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80771 \">table 3</a>).
