The organs in the urinary tract are the:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kidneys &ndash; The kidneys make urine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ureters &ndash; The ureters are thin tubes that carry urine from the kidneys to the bladder.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bladder &ndash; The bladder stores urine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urethra &ndash; The urethra is the tube that carries urine out of the body.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10257736\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes a urinary tract infection?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A urinary tract infection (or &quot;UTI&quot;) is usually caused by bacteria. Normally, bacteria are not in the urinary tract. But if they travel up the urethra and get into the bladder or kidneys, they can cause a UTI.</p><p>Children can have a higher chance of getting a UTI if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Their urinary system didn't form normally before birth.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Their bladder doesn't work normally.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They are boys and are not circumcised. Boys who are circumcised have had surgery to remove the skin that covers the tip of the penis.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10257751\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a UTI?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms depend on the child's age and ability to talk.</p><p>Children younger than 2 years old, and children who cannot talk, can have one or more of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever &ndash; This might be a child's only symptom.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vomiting or diarrhea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acting fussy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not feeding well</p><p/><p>Children age 2 years and older who are able to complain can have:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain or a burning feeling when they urinate</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A need to urinate more often than usual</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain in the lower belly or on the sides of the back (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F54658\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54658 \">figure 2</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10257766\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for a UTI?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. To check for a UTI, the doctor or nurse will do tests on your child's urine. To give a urine sample, your child will need to urinate into a container at the doctor's office.</p><p>If your child is not toilet trained, the doctor or nurse can get a sample of urine from your child's bladder. One way to do this is for the doctor or nurse to put a thin tube in your child's urethra and up into the bladder to drain a sample of urine. Then he or she will remove the tube and test the urine.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10257781\"><span class=\"h1\">How are UTIs treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UTIs are treated with antibiotic medicines. These medicines kill the bacteria causing the infection.</p><p>Your child's symptoms should begin to improve within 1 to 2 days of starting the medicine. It is important to have your child take the medicine exactly as directed. If he or she doesn't, the infection could come back.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10257796\"><span class=\"h1\">When should I call the doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Call the doctor or nurse if your child's symptoms don't get better or get worse, or if your child is not able to take the medicine.</p><p>You should also call if your child gets symptoms of another UTI in the future.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10257811\"><span class=\"h1\">What if my child gets UTIs a lot?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your child gets UTIs a lot, your child's doctor might recommend that your child take an antibiotic every day. This can help prevent him or her from getting more UTIs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10257826\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=fever-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Fever in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=deciding-about-circumcision-in-baby-boys-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Deciding about circumcision in baby boys (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-in-the-urine-hematuria-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Blood in the urine (hematuria) in children (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-infections-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Urinary tract infections in children (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
