For selected patients who have significant residual kidney function, some expert clinicians advocate that, under certain circumstances, the hemodialysis dose can be adjusted for the clearance provided by native kidney function. In such patients, the target clearance (ie, <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V)</span> is the sum of clearances provided by hemodialysis and native kidney function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incorporating-residual-kidney-function-into-the-dosing-of-intermittent-hemodialysis/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. As a result, the hemodialysis dose is lower than that which is typically prescribed. This method of prescribing a lower hemodialysis dose depending on the clearance provided by residual kidney function is called incremental hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incorporating-residual-kidney-function-into-the-dosing-of-intermittent-hemodialysis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The amount of prescribed hemodialysis can be decreased by reducing the hemodialysis time (for example, by time per session or by number of sessions) or by altering operating conditions such as dialyzer size and type, dialysate flow rate, or blood flow rate. The dose of hemodialysis must then be increased over time as residual kidney function declines in order to avoid uremia.</p><p>This topic review provides methods of providing incremental hemodialysis, including methods of estimating the hemodialysis dose based upon residual kidney function clearance. </p><p>Calculation of the standard hemodialysis dose is discussed elsewhere.

Historically, clinicians have always incorporated residual kidney function into a peritoneal dialysis prescription [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incorporating-residual-kidney-function-into-the-dosing-of-intermittent-hemodialysis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>However, the practice has not been widely used for hemodialysis dosing, since the intermittent nature of hemodialysis makes incorporation of residual renal function into dosing difficult. In addition, residual kidney function may decrease rapidly once patients are started on thrice-weekly hemodialysis. It was believed to be impractical to adjust the hemodialysis dose for rapidly declining residual kidney function among hemodialysis patients. By contrast, residual kidney function is preserved for a longer time among patients starting peritoneal dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incorporating-residual-kidney-function-into-the-dosing-of-intermittent-hemodialysis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>As a result, while there are extensive practical experience and outcomes data regarding incremental dosing of peritoneal dialysis, there are little experience and little published data on incremental dosing of hemodialysis. Many clinical trials that have examined peritoneal dialysis dosing incorporated residual kidney function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incorporating-residual-kidney-function-into-the-dosing-of-intermittent-hemodialysis/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. By contrast, major clinical trials of hemodialysis dosing, such as the Hemodialysis (HEMO) study, did not incorporate residual kidney function into hemodialysis dosing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incorporating-residual-kidney-function-into-the-dosing-of-intermittent-hemodialysis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>A few studies indirectly examined the relative safety of decreasing the initial hemodialysis dose among patients starting hemodialysis with significant residual kidney function and the relative harm that thrice-weekly hemodialysis might impart on native kidney function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incorporating-residual-kidney-function-into-the-dosing-of-intermittent-hemodialysis/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. The best study reported 15-year outcomes of 650 patients from one unit who were prescribed a target net clearance (ie, <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V)</span> of 1.2 per treatment session and incorporated residual kidney function into this dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incorporating-residual-kidney-function-into-the-dosing-of-intermittent-hemodialysis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Residual kidney function was measured every one to three months. Residual kidney function declined from 3.1&plusmn;1.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>, measured three months after starting hemodialysis, to 0.9&plusmn;1.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/1</span>.73 m<sup>2</sup>, measured at five years. Patients who had residual kidney function incorporated into their hemodialysis dose had better survival than patients who had insufficient residual kidney function to incorporate into the hemodialysis dose. Twice-weekly hemodialysis was only used for the first few months of therapy, and patients receiving twice-weekly hemodialysis had a target <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> of 2 per session.</p><p>The major observation from this study is that, independent of dose, hemodialysis patients with residual kidney function have superior outcomes compared with individuals without residual kidney function. It is not clear if survival of patients with residual kidney function would have been even better if they had received a standard dose of hemodialysis. However, the study did not show <strong>decreased</strong> survival among patients who were prescribed a lower dose and thus provides some reassurance regarding the safety of incorporating residual kidney function into the net target clearance and decreasing the clearance provided by hemodialysis.</p><p>As noted above, the amount of prescribed hemodialysis can be decreased by reducing the hemodialysis time (for example, by time per session or by number of sessions per week) or by altering operating conditions such as dialyzer size and type, dialysate flow rate, or blood flow rate. Some studies have suggested that decreasing the number of sessions per week may be associated with better preservation of residual kidney function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incorporating-residual-kidney-function-into-the-dosing-of-intermittent-hemodialysis/abstract/2,11-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,11-16</a>]. Such a strategy also minimizes fistula punctures, which could result in less fistula trauma, damage, morbidity, and ultimately mortality.</p><p>As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a large, retrospective, cohort study, patients undergoing twice-weekly hemodialysis had a slower rate of kidney function decline compared with a matched cohort with comparable baseline residual renal function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incorporating-residual-kidney-function-into-the-dosing-of-intermittent-hemodialysis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study from Spain compared the change in residual kidney function between 61 twice-weekly hemodialysis patients, 83 peritoneal dialysis patients, and 49 patients on thrice-weekly hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incorporating-residual-kidney-function-into-the-dosing-of-intermittent-hemodialysis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Patients in each group had similar baseline estimated GFR (eGFR). Patients who had twice-weekly hemodialysis or were on peritoneal dialysis had a smaller median loss of eGFR compared with those who were hemodialyzed thrice weekly (-0.18 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/month</span> versus -0.33 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min/month,</span> respectively).</p><p/><p>The maintenance of residual kidney function is a potential benefit of incremental hemodialysis since residual kidney function has been associated with improved survival.

The KDOQI guidelines recommended that, for hemodialysis schedules other than thrice weekly, there should be a target standard <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> of 2.3 per week, with a minimum delivered weekly <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> dose of 2.1 using a method of calculation that includes the contributions of ultrafiltration and residual kidney function. This is a very conservative position, based on expert opinion only. Should a lower dose be attained, frequent clinical evaluation for symptoms of under-dialysis must occur.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H726344611\"><span class=\"h1\">WHICH PATIENTS MAY BE CANDIDATES FOR INCREMENTAL HEMODIALYSIS?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We do not believe that there are sufficient data to recommend the use of incremental hemodialysis in all incident patients. As noted above, there are no randomized, controlled outcome studies that have shown that starting hemodialysis with less than a full dose results in comparable survival to patients who have the same level of residual kidney function and start dialysis with a full hemodialysis dose. As noted above, observational studies of patients on twice-weekly hemodialysis have not shown increased mortality, but did not investigate the use of reduced dose delivery with incremental hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incorporating-residual-kidney-function-into-the-dosing-of-intermittent-hemodialysis/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>].

The presence of residual kidney function is not recognized in quality measures reporting for patients on hemodialysis. Thus, if one decreases the time per session as a method of incremental hemodialysis in patients undergoing thrice-weekly hemodialysis, the center could potentially be penalized for not meeting quality measures. However, if one instead decreases the number of sessions to two treatments per week, it will not affect quality measures, because <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> on twice-weekly hemodialysis is not reported as a quality measure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H726344617\"><span class=\"h1\">THE PRESCRIPTION OF INCREMENTAL HEMODIALYSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no standard method for calculating the incremental hemodialysis dose, and no method has been linked to improved patient outcomes. The calculation is theoretical and requires an understanding of the rates at which urea (as a marker of solute) is cleared by the kidney and by intermittent hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incorporating-residual-kidney-function-into-the-dosing-of-intermittent-hemodialysis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Intermittent hemodialysis results in a marked decline in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) over the duration of the treatment, followed by a steady postdialysis increase in BUN. In contrast, residual kidney function provides continuous urea removal. Thus, one must combine the intermittent hemodialysis dose of hemodialysis with the continuous urea removal from residual kidney function. In 1998, theoretical calculations were published that allow one to combine clearances from residual kidney function and hemodialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incorporating-residual-kidney-function-into-the-dosing-of-intermittent-hemodialysis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>The most precise method for calculating the incremental hemodialysis dose incorporates clearance provided by residual kidney function and accounts for ultrafiltration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F105636\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef105636 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/incorporating-residual-kidney-function-into-the-dosing-of-intermittent-hemodialysis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In order to use this equation, residual kidney function must be determined. Residual kidney function is measured as the urea clearance. Using urea clearance to measure kidney function conforms to the standard practice of using the BUN concentrations and urea removal rates to measure peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis dose. Urea clearance generally underestimates the true glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and thus provides an appropriately conservative estimate of the contribution of residual kidney function.</p><p>There are several methods to measure urea clearance. One method is to obtain a postdialysis serum BUN measurement and predialysis serum BUN measurement of two consecutive hemodialysis treatments and measure a 24-hour urine volume and urine urea concentration during the interdialytic interval. Urea clearance is calculated using the mean of the postdialysis and predialysis BUN as the plasma urea concentration, the urine volume, and urine urea concentration:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p>Urea clearance= [[Urine urea <span class=\"nowrap\">(mg/dL)</span> x urine volume <span class=\"nowrap\">(mL/24</span> hours)] x 24 <span class=\"nowrap\">hours/1440</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">minutes]/]/plasma</span> urea <span class=\"nowrap\">(mg/dL)</span> urea clearance (in <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min)</span></p></div></div><p>An alternative method to measure urea clearance in hemodialysis patients is to obtain a 24-hour urine collection at the end of the weekend hemodialysis interval and use a BUN that is obtained at the start of the next hemodialysis treatment. However, this method tends to underestimate the actual clearance since the post-weekend BUN is likely the highest of the week and is in the denominator of the equation.</p><p>The weekly residual <span class=\"nowrap\">Kt/V</span> (K<sub>r</sub><span class=\"nowrap\">t/V)</span> is calculated from urea clearance.

(See <a href=\"#H633394444\" class=\"local\">'Background'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are not sufficient data to prefer the use of incremental hemodialysis, as there are no good outcome studies that have shown that starting hemodialysis with less than a full dose results in comparable survival to patients who have the same level of residual kidney function and start hemodialysis with a full hemodialysis dose. Observational studies of patients on twice-weekly hemodialysis have not shown increased mortality. (See <a href=\"#H633394444\" class=\"local\">'Background'</a> above and <a href=\"#H726344611\" class=\"local\">'Which patients may be candidates for incremental hemodialysis?'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Incremental hemodialysis may theoretically improve quality of life and help to preserve the hemodialysis access, although these have not been demonstrated (although more frequent hemodialysis has been associated with increased hemoaccess problems). In addition, several observational studies suggest that, compared with thrice-weekly hemodialysis, twice-weekly hemodialysis may preserve residual kidney function, but the evidence is not strong. (See <a href=\"#H633394444\" class=\"local\">'Background'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients must be carefully selected for incremental hemodialysis. Potential candidates should have limited interdialytic weight gain, easily controlled serum potassium and phosphorus, no cardiovascular or pulmonary disease that is exacerbated by interdialytic fluid gains, and good nutritional status. Patients must understand that hemodialysis dose will be increased over time and be willing to do so. (See <a href=\"#H726344611\" class=\"local\">'Which patients may be candidates for incremental hemodialysis?'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A major weakness of the incremental approach to hemodialysis is that residual kidney function must be checked regularly. The residual kidney function generally declines over time on hemodialysis. In order to have adequate clearance, the hemodialysis dose must be increased as residual kidney function decreases. (See <a href=\"#H740573629\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring residual kidney function'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several methods are available for combining residual kidney function and hemodialysis dose mathematically. These methods have been developed based on theory and have not been tested in clinical practice. We err on the side of increased hemodialysis when using these approaches.
