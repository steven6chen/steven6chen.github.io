A number of environmental causes have been implicated, including several bacteria, viruses, toxins, and drugs, which are described below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/7-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-11</a>]. Some of the most compelling evidence for an environmental factor has been derived from epidemiologic studies, which have demonstrated geographic clustering, clustering of cases across time, and seasonal variation in the diagnosis of PBC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p>As examples, the incidence of PBC has been estimated to be 200 to 251 per million in South Wales and Northeast England, less than 25 per million in Canada and Australia, and almost zero in Sub-Saharan Africa and India [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/12-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-16</a>]. A limitation of these studies is that the varying incidence rates may in part be due to genetic differences in the populations and to differences in study methodology. However, that an environmental factor may be involved was strongly implicated in a study from a well-defined geographical population cohort in Northern England [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>] and around toxic waste sites in New York City [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Analysis of cases demonstrated unequivocal clustering in well-demarcated geographic regions.</p><p>The unanswered question in PBC is what causes or triggers the T-cell attack on small bile duct epithelial cells? Current data suggest that PBC is an autoimmune disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Like other better characterized autoimmune diseases, there appear to be at least two distinct requirements for PBC to develop: genetic susceptibility; and a triggering event that initiates the autoimmune attack on bile duct cells.</p><p>The prevalence of PBC in families with one affected member is estimated to be 100-fold greater than that in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. However, the disorder is not inherited in any simple recessive or dominant pattern. Familial occurrences of the disease have included sisters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], brothers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], brothers and sisters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], and parent and child [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In addition, unaffected family members are more likely than controls to have impaired T-cell regulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>] and increased numbers of circulating autoantibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. However, there is not a significant increase in antimitochondrial antibody, the serologic marker of PBC, in healthy family members if purified recombinant mitochondrial autoantigens are used in the assay [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Antimitochondrial antibodies'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H130787338\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic susceptibility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There have been extensive genomewide association studies (GWAS) in patients with PBC, and a number of associations have been documented. However, while such associations are of considerable interest, they have not yet been translated into useful clinical testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>]. There is a weak association between PBC and haplotype HLA-DR8 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>] and the HLA-DPB1 gene in some populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. Accumulated data suggest that there may be an inherited abnormality of immune regulation, perhaps an inability to suppress an inflammatory attack on small bile ducts once it is initiated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/31,34,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,34,36</a>]. One study found an association of PBC with a variant in the CTLA4 gene, which encodes a co-inhibitory immunoreceptor involved in self-tolerance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Another report found a significant association with genetic variants at the HLA class II, IL12A, and IL12RB2<em> </em>loci (which have a role in interleukin-12 immunoregulatory signaling) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The importance of IL12 has been underscored in animal models and in a case report of a child with congenital IL12 deficiency who developed PBC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Other susceptibility loci that have been identified include SPIB (which encodes for a transcription factor involved in B-cell receptor signaling and T-cell lineage decisions), IRF5 (which encodes for interferon regulatory factor 5), TNPO3 (which encodes for transportin 3), and MMEL1 (which encodes for a metallo-endopeptidase) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]. Interestingly, IRF5 and TNPO3 have also been implicated in the pathogenesis of systemic lupus erythematosus, systemic sclerosis and Sjogrens syndrome, suggesting that there is a genetic overlap in PBC and these disorders. The concordance of PBC in identical twins is approximately 50 percent, somewhat higher than the concordance of autoimmunity in identical twins with lupus and rheumatoid arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>].</p><p>Why the disease primarily affects women is unclear. A plausible theory relates to immunological tolerance, a component of which depends upon genes located on the X chromosome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. One study suggested that women with PBC were more likely to have monosomy of the X chromosome (a marker reflecting haploinsufficiency for specific X-linked genes) compared with healthy controls or those with hepatitis C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">MOLECULAR MIMICRY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Molecular mimicry refers to a phenomenon where antigens evoking an immune response have enough similarity to endogenous proteins to incite an autoimmune reaction. Such a mechanism has been widely proposed to initiate autoimmunity in patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC). Several candidate inciting agents (including bacteria, viruses and various chemicals) have been proposed, but none has been proven definitively.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An infectious etiology for triggering PBC has been suspected, although a specific etiologic agent has not been unequivocally identified. Several agents have been implicated; some have been disproven while others remain topics of investigation.</p><p>It is possible that infection and the presence of antimitochondrial antibodies (AMA) (see <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Antimitochondrial antibodies'</a> below) may be pathogenetically linked. A study comparing peripheral blood mononuclear cells from patients with PBC with controls found that patients with PBC had a much higher number of inducible IgM-producing B-cells and that each B-cell produced a greater quantity of IgM protein compared with controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. Induction of the B-cells was achieved by stimulation with unmethylated CpG DNA motifs (non-proteinaceous repeated sequences found frequently in bacteria). The authors hypothesized that patients with PBC are hyperresponsive with respect to IgM production and that the heightened IgM production may reflect how various microorganisms interact with the immune system in patients with PBC. Interestingly, there is a significant increase in AMA-specific plasmablasts in the blood of patients with PBC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Retroviruses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preliminary data from one laboratory suggested that infection with a retrovirus may be associated with PBC in some patients. However, these data have not been replicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. </p><p>Biochemical improvement from combination antiretroviral treatment was observed in an open-label pilot study (also from the same group), a finding that has not yet been confirmed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].

Furthermore, no benefit from treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetracycline</a> was observed in a pilot open-label study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Escherichia coli</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antibodies reacting against the mitochondrial human pyruvate dehydrogenase complex crossreact with the <em>E. coli</em> pyruvate dehydrogenase complex implicating <em>E. coli</em> infection (particularly urinary tract infection) in the pathogenesis of PBC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/53-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">53-57</a>]. A problem with this theory is that antibodies against the <em>E. coli</em> are often in lower titers than against the human complex, and the <em>E. coli</em> antibodies are more frequent in patients with advanced disease (rather than being present in patients with early-stage disease, which would be more supportive of a role as an inciting agent).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">N. aromaticivorans</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Novosphingobium aromaticivorans</em> (<em>N. aromaticivorans</em>) is a ubiquitous gram-negative organism that metabolizes organic compounds and estrogens. Two of its proteins share homology with the E2 component of pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDC-E2), the major epitope recognized by antimitochondrial antibodies. A role for the bacteria in the pathogenesis of PBC was suggested in a pilot study in which 100 percent of 77 PBC patients (who were anti-PDC-E2 positive) had high antibody titers against the organism compared to none of 195 controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].

These observations provide increasing evidence that exposure to <em>N. aromaticivorans</em> is associated with the development of PBC, the clinical implications of which are uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Lactobacillus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A case report described a patient who developed PBC after receiving intramuscular vaccination with a vaccine containing several <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lactobacillus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lactobacillus</a> species to treat recurrent vaginosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. The patient had AMA-M2 antimitochondrial antibodies that reacted against the major PBC-specific mitochondrial auto-epitope (ie, pyruvate dehydrogenase complex E2) but reacted even more strongly against <em>Lactobacillus delbrueckii</em>.

Chronic impairment of bile flow leads to portal and parenchymal inflammation, liver cell necrosis, scarring, and eventually to cirrhosis and liver failure. The clinical progression, however, requires years, and at present there are no clear prognostic factors that predict the rate of liver failure in a given patient. Furthermore, it is likely that there are various immunological mechanisms at play during the progression of disease (ie, there may be different pathways involved in the inflammatory response, the destruction of bile ducts, and the development of fibrosis).
