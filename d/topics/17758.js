Early stage (IA to IIA) disease consists of papules, patches, or plaques, with limited, if any, lymph node involvement and no visceral involvement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F75768%7EHEME%2F53711\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75768 graphicRef53711 \">table 1A-B</a>). Patients with limited skin involvement plus the more aggressive histopathologic findings of folliculotropism or transformed large cell variants and those with blood involvement are treated as more advanced disease. (See <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'Special scenarios'</a> below.)</p><p>The management of early stage MF will be discussed here. The management of more advanced stage MF and the more aggressive leukemic variant, S&eacute;zary syndrome, is presented separately as are the clinical presentation, diagnosis, staging, and prognosis of MF and S&eacute;zary syndrome.

Patients with stage IA disease who also have greater than 5 percent circulating atypical (S&eacute;zary) cells (ie, those with B1 disease), histologic evidence of the folliculotropic variant, or large cell transformed MF are treated with more aggressive therapy. (See <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'Special scenarios'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients with stage IA disease are treated with skin-directed therapies. A randomized trial demonstrated that early aggressive therapy with combination chemotherapy plus total skin electron beam radiation therapy does not appear to improve survival when compared with the use of sequential topical regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-ia-to-iia-mycosis-fungoides/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Skin directed therapies include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Topical corticosteroids</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Topical chemotherapy (nitrogen mustard or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carmustine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carmustine</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Topical retinoids</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imiquimod-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imiquimod</a></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Local radiation (x-ray or electron beam)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Phototherapy (UVB or PUVA)</p><p/><p>Despite decades of experience in the treatment of MF, well-designed, prospective, controlled clinical studies comparing the efficacy of various therapies are lacking.</p><p>For most patients with stage IA MF, we recommend the use of skin-directed therapies rather than systemic therapies. The choice among skin-directed therapies is made based upon the physician's experience with these methods, patient characteristics, and side effect profiles. In general, topical corticosteroids are the preferred initial treatment option in our practice. Other clinicians prefer the initial use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechlorethamine-nitrogen-mustard-topical-gel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">topical nitrogen mustard</a>. If a skin-directed therapy fails to obtain an adequate or complete response, or is poorly tolerated, a rotation to an alternative skin-directed therapy is attempted before progressing to systemic therapies. In general, patients with stage IA will have multiple courses of skin-directed therapies over their lifetime before, if ever, receiving a systemic therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19277711\"><span class=\"h2\">Topical corticosteroids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Topical corticosteroids are effective in early stage MF with the majority of patients obtaining a complete response (CR). The choice of steroid strength depends upon the body area affected and the severity of the skin symptoms and signs, but generally high potency or super-high potency corticosteroids are used (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62402\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62402 \">table 3</a>). A response is typically seen within three months. While there have been some patients who have responded after this time, patients who have no response by the third month should be offered alternative therapies.</p><p>A prospective study of class I corticosteroids in 79 patients with stage T1 (51 patients) or T2 patch or plaque MF followed for a median of nine months reported an overall response rate of 94 percent with 63 percent CRs in patients with T1 disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-ia-to-iia-mycosis-fungoides/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Further follow-up of approximately 200 patients treated with class I corticosteroids at this same institution reported a continued greater than 90 percent response rate in patients with T1 disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-ia-to-iia-mycosis-fungoides/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19277718\"><span class=\"h3\">Administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Topical corticosteroids are available in ointments, creams, solutions, foams, and gels. Ointments may be more effective than creams, but some patients prefer the cosmetic appearance of creams. Ointments are preferable for areas of dry skin while foams, solutions, or gels may be more suitable for lesions on the scalp. Gels are useful for treating hairy regions, but are generally too drying for routine use otherwise. Topical corticosteroids are applied once or twice daily to all affected areas. Caution should be used when applying topical corticosteroids near the eye. Plastic film occlusion may enhance the effectiveness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-ia-to-iia-mycosis-fungoides/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Topical steroids should be discontinued when the lesions are completely cleared. Maintenance regimens are not used with topical steroids due to the concern of skin atrophy. Treatment may be restarted if lesions recur.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19277725\"><span class=\"h3\">Toxicities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The long-term use of topical corticosteroids may result in skin atrophy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> striae formation. As the potency of the steroid increases, the risk of these complications increases as well. High-potency corticosteroids can result in systemic absorption if applied to large skin surfaces and there have been cases of clinically evident adrenal suppression and Cushing's syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-systemic-glucocorticoids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of systemic glucocorticoids&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Topical nitrogen mustard (mechlorethamine, HN2)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechlorethamine-nitrogen-mustard-topical-gel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Topical nitrogen mustard</a> (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechlorethamine-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mechlorethamine</a> hydrochloride, HN2) produces clinical response in 70 to 80 percent in patients with limited <span class=\"nowrap\">patch/plaque</span> (T1) disease, with a median time to skin clearance of six to eight months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-ia-to-iia-mycosis-fungoides/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>]. When treatment is discontinued, most patients will relapse in the skin at some point, but most will respond to a second course of therapy. Approximately 20 to 25 percent of patients treated with topical HN2 will have a durable CR lasting greater than 10 years. Topical HN2 has also been used safely in pediatric patients with MF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-ia-to-iia-mycosis-fungoides/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HN2 is available in a gel, an ointment base, or as a powder to be mixed with tap water and applied daily.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nitrogen mustard topical gel is the only <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechlorethamine-nitrogen-mustard-topical-gel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">topical nitrogen mustard</a> preparation approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of MF; it is available in a 0.016% formulation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nitrogen mustard ointment is prepared by the pharmacist at an initial concentration of 10 to 20 mg of HN2 per 100 grams of Aquaphor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For the aqueous preparation, patients prepare the solution themselves at a concentration of 10 to 20 mg per 100 mL of tap water and apply it to their skin with a cloth or brush.</p><p/><p>In a randomized trial, the gel preparation was noninferior to nitrogen mustard ointment as determined by response rates using the Composite Assessment of Index Lesion Severity (59 versus 48 percent) and the Modified Severity-Weighted Assessment Tool (47 versus 46 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-ia-to-iia-mycosis-fungoides/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The choice is often dependent upon convenience, patient preference, or cost issues (ointment preparation uses less HN2 for a similar response). </p><p>Patients themselves do not have to wear protective gloves when applying the HN2, although they are advised to wash their hands afterwards. The HN2 penetrates the thick epidermis of the palms only slowly. When others help the patient apply the HN2, they should use gloves.</p><p>The preparation is initially applied to the entire skin except the genitalia once daily. Areas of disease activity not initially detected may become evident secondary to an inflammatory reaction provoked by the HN2. After a period of several weeks, treatment may then be limited to the affected region. Alternatively, the topical HN2 can be applied initially to the affected anatomical region(s) alone, and then followed clinically for any new areas of involvement. If there is no response by three months, the concentration of the topical HN2 should be increased every few months until the response is satisfactory, up to concentrations of 30 to 40 mg percent, especially if it is to be applied to small areas. Alternatively, the frequency of application may be increased to twice daily.</p><p>Treatment is continued on a daily basis until complete skin clearance, followed by a variable duration of maintenance therapy. The standard duration of maintenance therapy used at Stanford is one to two months. There is no evidence that more prolonged maintenance therapy is beneficial.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Toxicities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary complication of topical HN2 therapy is an acute or delayed hypersensitivity reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-ia-to-iia-mycosis-fungoides/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. If a hypersensitivity reaction occurs, a variety of topical or systemic desensitization programs may be used. The aqueous preparation is associated with a much higher incidence of hypersensitivity reactions compared with the ointment preparation (&gt;30 versus &lt;5 percent). In 12 patients with a history of hypersensitivity to topical aqueous HN2, only 3 developed contact dermatitis to the ointment-based preparation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-ia-to-iia-mycosis-fungoides/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Other side effects include hypo- or hyperpigmentation of treated areas. Secondary squamoproliferative lesions have developed primarily in patients treated with multiple sequential topical therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-ia-to-iia-mycosis-fungoides/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. There does not appear to be an increased risk of development of secondary skin cancers in patients who have used topical HN2 as monotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-ia-to-iia-mycosis-fungoides/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In addition, there is minimal systemic absorption of topically applied HN2, thus systemic complications such as bone marrow suppression or infertility have not been observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-ia-to-iia-mycosis-fungoides/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Topical carmustine (BCNU)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carmustine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carmustine</a> (BCNU) appears to have similar efficacy to topical HN2 with a total response rate of 98 percent (86 percent complete) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-ia-to-iia-mycosis-fungoides/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Complete responses generally require 8 to 20 weeks of treatment. Responses appear to be long-lived with approximately 90 percent of patients with T1 disease with disease control at three years.</p><p>Topical BCNU is generally not advised for patients with greater than 3 percent skin involvement because systemic absorption can lead to hematologic toxicities. Given the available alternatives, topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carmustine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carmustine</a> is rarely used in practice.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>BCNU can be mixed in an alcohol solution or incorporated into an ointment with a petrolatum base at a concentration of 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/100</span> g petrolatum.

Local reactions are common; the majority of patients will develop erythema, often accompanied by a burning sensation, at the areas of application and accentuated in the body folds, groin, and axillae. Erythema usually subsides within a few weeks, but may require localized treatment with cool compresses, cool baths, topical corticosteroids, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> emollients. Patients may also develop skin thinning, hyperpigmentation, and telangiectasias in areas where the drug is applied. Most telangiectasias will resolve.

Complete clearance may take 12 to 16 weeks, and the median response duration (on continuous or maintenance therapy) from start of therapy is estimated at two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-ia-to-iia-mycosis-fungoides/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Since topical bexarotene is a skin irritant, its use is generally limited to patients with involvement of less than 15 percent of their body surface area.</p><p>Retinoids have been used primarily in patients with refractory or advanced disease as part of a combination regimen or as adjuvant therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-ia-to-iia-mycosis-fungoides/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. A phase III trial of topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bexarotene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bexarotene</a> in 50 patients with refractory or persistent early stage disease reported responses in 62 and 50 percent of those with stage IA or stage IB disease, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-ia-to-iia-mycosis-fungoides/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

More frequent application, up to four times a day, can be used, if tolerated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Toxicities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bexarotene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bexarotene</a> is generally well tolerated. The most common adverse effects are a mild to moderate irritant dermatitis, pruritus, burning pain at the application site, and skin inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-ia-to-iia-mycosis-fungoides/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Systemic and topical forms of bexarotene are absolutely contraindicated in pregnancy. All retinoids can also increase sun sensitivity. The use of sun-protective clothing <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sunscreen is recommended, particularly when prolonged sun exposure is anticipated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiation therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MF is extremely sensitive to radiation therapy, and ionizing radiation in the form of x-rays is one of the most effective treatments for localized MF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-ia-to-iia-mycosis-fungoides/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Previously, low energy x-rays (approximately 100 kvp) were used for the treatment of isolated lesions. Unfortunately, short- and long-term toxicities limit its use. Electron beam therapy, now widely available, is usually more appropriate, since electrons of appropriate energy can be used to confine the dose of radiation to the superficial layers of the skin to avoid damage to deeper tissues.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Electron beam therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Total skin electron beam therapy (EBT) should be reserved for patients with progressive and extensive skin disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-ia-to-iia-mycosis-fungoides/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Overall response rates approach 100 percent and complete responses range from 40 to 98 percent depending upon the extent of skin involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-ia-to-iia-mycosis-fungoides/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. As many as half of patients with limited disease and a quarter of those with extensive disease will remain free of disease at five years. A long-term follow-up study at Stanford demonstrated that, despite a superior complete response rate with total skin EBT over topical HN2, there did not appear to be a difference in the overall survival outcomes in patients with stage IA disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-ia-to-iia-mycosis-fungoides/abstract/6,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,23</a>]. Side effects include desquamation, xerosis, and erythema of the skin. (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'TSEBT toxicities'</a> below.)</p><p>For the rare patient with a single lesion (unilesional) or localized MF, local EBT can result in efficient disease clearance and permanent disease control [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-ia-to-iia-mycosis-fungoides/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Local EBT is delivered to individual lesions with a peripheral margin up to two centimeters, but the exact area treated may be dependent upon the location and proximity to sensitive tissues. </p><p>The usual total dose for local treatment is 8 to 12 Gy administered in one to six fractions. The total dose of radiation used in trials has ranged from 8 to 30 Gy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-ia-to-iia-mycosis-fungoides/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>].

In a retrospective, single center study, a single fraction radiation dose of 4 to 9 Gy produced a complete response in 255 of 270 individual lesions (94 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-ia-to-iia-mycosis-fungoides/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Following local EBT, there are usually not recurrences within the treatment field, but new lesions can develop outside of the field. Local EBT may be followed by a topical maintenance regimen such as topical HN2 or topical corticosteroids.</p><p>Treatment-related toxicity is dependent upon the dose of radiation used and the location of the tumor.

Since cumulative doses of ultraviolet light are associated with an increased risk of certain skin neoplasms, phototherapy may not be appropriate in patients with a history of extensive squamoproliferative skin neoplasms, basal cell carcinomas, or melanoma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psoralen-plus-ultraviolet-a-puva-photochemotherapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Psoralen plus ultraviolet A (PUVA) photochemotherapy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uvb-therapy-broadband-and-narrowband\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;UVB therapy (broadband and narrowband)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It is common practice to use UVB for most patch disease, reserving PUVA for thicker <span class=\"nowrap\">patch/plaque</span> lesions.

Although a tapering schedule followed by a maintenance phase is widely used in clinical practice for patients achieving a complete response with PUVA, there is only limited evidence supporting the efficacy of maintenance regimens in prolonging remission. A review of one prospective and two retrospective studies found that short-term maintenance phototherapy seems not effective in reducing the risk of relapse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-ia-to-iia-mycosis-fungoides/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].

Narrow-band UVB uses a 311 nm wavelength, while broad-band UVB a 290 to 320 nm wavelength. Narrow-band UVB has demonstrated superior efficacy and decreased toxicity when compared with broad-band, but not PUVA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-ia-to-iia-mycosis-fungoides/abstract/38,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,43</a>]. Narrow-band UVB has demonstrated complete response rates of 83 percent in patients with patch-type stage IA disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-ia-to-iia-mycosis-fungoides/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. Due to its shallow penetration into the dermis, UVB is most appropriate for thin skin lesions. </p><p>Treatment is administered in a dermatology office three to five times per week with gradual incremental dose delivery. Improvement is generally seen after 20 to 40 treatments. After a complete response is achieved, the frequency of therapy is tapered very slowly during the maintenance period and then discontinued [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-ia-to-iia-mycosis-fungoides/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. The tapering schedule is non-standardized and differs by institution. As an example of a slow taper, after a complete response or plateau in response, treatments may be decreased from three times a week to twice weekly for one to two months, then decreased to once weekly for one to two months, followed by discontinuation of therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">PUVA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with limited <span class=\"nowrap\">patch/plaque</span> (T1) disease treated with PUVA achieve complete response rates as high as 90 percent. The usual time to skin clearance is two to six months and the likelihood of clearance is related to the extent of skin involvement. Some patients may obtain a long-term durable response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-ia-to-iia-mycosis-fungoides/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>PUVA treatment (320 to 400 nm wavelength) is administered three times a week until skin clearance is achieved, after which the frequency of treatment is tapered very slowly, in a similar fashion to that done with UVB, to as infrequently as once every two weeks. If lesions recur during maintenance therapy, the treatment frequency is increased. Maintenance therapy should be discontinued within one year in order to minimize the risks of cutaneous carcinogenesis. When maintenance therapy is discontinued, the majority of patients will relapse. However, patients who relapse are likely to respond to retreatment.</p><p>PUVA treatment consists of a timed exposure to UVA light in a phototherapy unit (PUVA box) administered approximately 1.5 to 2 hours after an oral dose of psoralen. In general, the entire body is treated except for the eyes and genitalia, which are shielded routinely. Other selected areas can be shielded to minimize undesired photodamage. Certain &quot;shadowed&quot; areas such as the scalp, perineum, axillae, and other skin fold areas will not receive adequate exposure.</p><p>Acute complications of PUVA treatment include erythema, pruritus, blistering, skin dryness, and nausea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-ia-to-iia-mycosis-fungoides/abstract/40,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,45</a>]. Potential long-term complications include increased risk of cataracts (requiring the use of UVA-opaque goggles during therapy and glasses after therapy). Patients must shield their skin and eyes from the sun for at least 24 hours after ingestion of psoralen. Patients who undergo long-term continuous treatment with PUVA are at risk for developing secondary cutaneous carcinomas or melanomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-ia-to-iia-mycosis-fungoides/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. Among patients treated for MF, this risk is greatest for patients who have undergone long-term treatment with multiple skin damaging skin-directed therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-early-stage-ia-to-iia-mycosis-fungoides/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h1\">STAGE IB/IIA DISEASE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stage IB disease includes those patients with patches, plaques, or papules that involve 10 percent or more of the total skin surface with no involvement of lymph nodes or viscera (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F75768%7EHEME%2F53711\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75768 graphicRef53711 \">table 1A-B</a>).

Thus, the management of these patients labeled with large cell transformation must be individualized according to the clinical behavior.

Early stage (IA to IIA) disease consists of papules, patches, or plaques, with limited, if any, lymph node involvement and no visceral involvement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F75768%7EHEME%2F53711\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75768 graphicRef53711 \">table 1A-B</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F75528\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75528 \">table 2</a>).

A choice among these is largely dependent on the extent and severity of disease.

Systemic biologic therapies, such as retinoids or interferons, histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, or low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> are used if skin-directed therapies fail, if skin symptoms are <span class=\"nowrap\">extensive/severe,</span> or if patients have a worse prognostic profile such as folliculotropic MF, large cell transformation, or early blood involvement.
