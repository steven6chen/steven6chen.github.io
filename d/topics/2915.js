When larger amounts of fluid accumulate (pericardial effusion) or when the pericardium becomes scarred and inelastic, one of three pericardial compressive syndromes may occur:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac tamponade &ndash; Cardiac tamponade, which may be acute or subacute, is characterized by the accumulation of pericardial fluid under pressure. Variants include low pressure (occult) and regional cardiac tamponade.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Constrictive pericarditis &ndash; Constrictive pericarditis is the result of scarring and consequent loss of elasticity of the pericardial sac. Pericardial constriction is typically chronic, but variants include subacute, transient, and occult constriction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Effusive-constrictive pericarditis &ndash; Effusive-constrictive pericarditis is characterized by underlying constrictive physiology with a coexisting pericardial effusion, usually with cardiac tamponade. Such patients may be mistakenly thought to have only cardiac tamponade; however, elevation of the right atrial and pulmonary wedge pressures after drainage of the pericardial fluid points to the underlying constrictive process.</p><p/><p>In both cardiac tamponade and constrictive pericarditis, cardiac filling is impeded by an external force. The normal pericardium can stretch to accommodate physiologic changes in cardiac volume. However, after its reserve volume is exceeded, the pericardium markedly stiffens. An important pathophysiologic feature of both cardiac tamponade and constrictive pericarditis is greatly enhanced ventricular interaction or interdependence, in which the hemodynamics of the left and right heart chambers are directly influenced by each other to a much greater degree than normal.</p><p>The physiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of cardiac tamponade will be reviewed here. Issues related to constrictive pericarditis and the evaluation and management of pericardial diseases that do not compromise hemodynamics are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=constrictive-pericarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Constrictive pericarditis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pericardial-effusion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and treatment of pericardial effusion&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-pericarditis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute pericarditis: Clinical presentation and diagnostic evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In cardiac tamponade, the primary abnormality is compression of all cardiac chambers due to increased pericardial pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tamponade/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The pericardium has some degree of elasticity; but once the elastic limit is reached, the heart must compete with the intrapericardial fluid for the fixed intrapericardial volume. As cardiac tamponade progresses, the cardiac chambers become smaller, and chamber diastolic compliance is reduced. The following consequences result from this constrained cardiac filling:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Progressive changes in systemic venous return &ndash; Venous return is normally bimodal with peaks during ventricular systole and early diastole. The effusion produces compression throughout the cardiac cycle, with cardiac volume becoming minimal during ejection. Thus, as cardiac tamponade becomes more severe, venous return is progressively shifted to systole as the peak associated with early diastolic filling diminishes. When cardiac tamponade is very severe, total venous return falls, the cardiac chambers shrink, and cardiac output and blood pressure fall.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Respiratory variation in venous return &ndash; Inspiratory decline in thoracic pressure is transmitted through the pericardium to the right side of the heart and the pulmonary vasculature. As a result, systemic venous return to the right heart increases with inspiration, and pulmonary venous return to the left heart decreases with inspiration. In cardiac tamponade, the rigid pericardium prevents the free wall from expanding. The ensuing distension of the right ventricle is limited to the interventricular septum, which along with relative underfilling of the left ventricle causes the septum to bulge to the left, reducing left ventricular compliance and contributing to further decreased filling of the left ventricle during inspiration. This concept is referred to as &quot;ventricular interaction&quot; or &quot;ventricular interdependence.&quot; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulsus-paradoxus-in-pericardial-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulsus paradoxus in pericardial disease&quot;</a>.)<br/><br/>These changes will occur once pericardial pressure becomes substantially higher than ventricular diastolic pressures. However, in less severe disease, the degree to which they occur is related in part to the rate of pericardial fluid accumulation and to pericardial compliance, both of which are related to the underlying cause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tamponade/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute bleeding (eg, due to trauma) into a relatively stiff pericardium can rapidly lead to cardiac tamponade. As intrapericardial volume increases, there is an initial small increase in intrapericardial pressure followed by an almost vertical ascent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F75068\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75068 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>By comparison, chronic accumulation of a pericardial effusion (eg, due to renal failure or malignancy) allows the pericardial compliance to increase gradually. As a result, intrapericardial pressure increases more slowly until a critical point is reached when an almost vertical ascent is again seen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F75068\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75068 \">figure 1</a>). In this setting, cardiac tamponade may not occur until two liters or more have accumulated.</p><p/><p>Very little fluid needs to accumulate to produce cardiac tamponade once the pericardium can no longer stretch [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tamponade/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. At this point, the initial removal of fluid during pericardiocentesis produces the largest reduction in intrapericardial pressure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The causes of cardiac tamponade include all of the causes of pericardial effusion or hemorrhage into the pericardium (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F67851\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67851 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F78847\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78847 \">table 2</a>) as well as iatrogenic etiologies. In one series, cardiac tamponade occurred in 14 percent of patients with idiopathic pericarditis and 61 percent of those with neoplastic, tuberculous, or purulent pericarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tamponade/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-of-pericardial-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology of pericardial disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pericardial-disease-associated-with-malignancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pericardial disease associated with malignancy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberculous-pericarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tuberculous pericarditis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Cardiac tamponade has been described in less than one percent of patients with an acute myocardial infarction treated with fibrinolytic therapy; the risk may be lower in patients treated with percutaneous coronary intervention. The two major mechanisms are left ventricular free wall rupture and hemorrhagic pericarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tamponade/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Cardiac tamponade is a frequent complication of type A aortic dissection, occurring in 19 percent of patients in an international registry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tamponade/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pericardial-complications-of-myocardial-infarction#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pericardial complications of myocardial infarction&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation and diagnosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-aortic-dissection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of acute aortic dissection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In a 15-year, single-center experience of 5222 catheter ablations of atrial fibrillation (3483 patients), cardiac tamponade complicated 51 procedures (1 percent). No clinical factors were associated with cardiac tamponade, but it occurred less often after cryoablation than radiofrequency ablation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tamponade/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presentation of patients with cardiac tamponade largely depends upon the length of time over which pericardial fluid accumulates and the clinical situation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute cardiac tamponade occurs within minutes, due to trauma, rupture of the heart or aorta, or as a complication of an invasive diagnostic or therapeutic procedure. This generally results in a picture resembling cardiogenic shock that requires urgent reduction in pericardial pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tamponade/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-penetrating-thoracic-trauma-in-adults#H6092649\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of penetrating thoracic trauma in adults&quot;, section on 'Pericardial tamponade'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subacute cardiac tamponade occurs over days to weeks and can be associated with neoplastic, uremic, or idiopathic pericarditis. Symptoms include dyspnea, chest discomfort or fullness, peripheral edema, and fatigability.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low pressure (occult) cardiac tamponade, a subset of subacute cardiac tamponade, occurs in patients who are severely hypovolemic.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regional cardiac tamponade occurs when a loculated, eccentric effusion or localized hematoma produces regional cardiac tamponade in which only selected chambers are compressed. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute cardiac tamponade</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute cardiac tamponade is sudden in onset, may be associated with chest pain, tachypnea, and dyspnea, and is life-threatening if not promptly treated. The jugular venous pressure is markedly elevated and may be associated with venous distension in the forehead and scalp. The heart sounds are often muted. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Physical findings'</a> below and <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> below.)</p><p>Hypotension is common due to the decline in cardiac output. Patients in cardiogenic shock typically have cool extremities, peripheral cyanosis, and decreased urine output. As noted above, the pericardial effusion in such patients is usually small because the pericardium is stiff (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F75068\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75068 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Subacute cardiac tamponade</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Subacute cardiac tamponade is usually a less dramatic process than acute cardiac tamponade. Patients may be asymptomatic early in the course, but once intrapericardial pressure reaches a critical value, they complain of dyspnea, chest discomfort or fullness, peripheral edema, fatigability, or other symptoms referable to increased filling pressures and limited cardiac output.</p><p>The physical examination in subacute severe cardiac tamponade may reveal hypotension with a narrow pulse pressure, reflecting the limited stroke volume. However, patients with preexisting hypertension may remain hypertensive due to increased sympathetic activity in the setting of cardiac tamponade.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Low pressure cardiac tamponade</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who are severely hypovolemic because of traumatic hemorrhage, hemodialysis or ultrafiltration, or overdiuresis at presentation may have low pressure cardiac tamponade in which the intracardiac and pericardial diastolic pressures are only 6 to 12 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tamponade/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The hemodynamic significance of these effusions can be demonstrated on echocardiography by right heart chamber collapse and respiratory variations in transvalvular flows. A fluid challenge with a rapid infusion of one liter of isotonic saline in the catheterization laboratory will usually elicit typical cardiac tamponade hemodynamics.</p><p>The clinical characteristics of low pressure cardiac tamponade were illustrated in a series of 279 patients from a single institution who underwent combined pericardiocentesis and cardiac catheterization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tamponade/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Patients were considered to have cardiac tamponade if intrapericardial pressures were equal to right atrial pressure prior to pericardiocentesis. Among 143 patients with cardiac tamponade, low pressure cardiac tamponade was diagnosed in 29 patients who had an initial intrapericardial pressure &lt;7 mmHg and a right atrial pressure after pericardiocentesis &lt;4 mmHg.</p><p>The following findings were noted:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Echocardiographic abnormalities (eg, size of the pericardial effusion, right sided chamber collapse, and exaggerated respiratory changes in mitral and tricuspid valve flow) were similar in frequency and magnitude to patients with classic cardiac tamponade. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Echocardiography'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The spectrum of etiologies was similar to patients with classic cardiac tamponade. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical findings commonly associated with cardiac tamponade (eg, elevated heart rate, jugular venous distention, and pulsus paradoxus) were significantly less common in low pressure cardiac tamponade than in classic cardiac tamponade. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Physical findings'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Regional cardiac tamponade</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A loculated, eccentric effusion or localized hematoma can produce regional cardiac tamponade in which only selected chambers are compressed. As a result, the typical physical, hemodynamic, and echocardiographic signs of cardiac tamponade are often absent, including pulsus paradoxus, diastolic pressure equalization, and chamber compression in standard apical and parasternal views.</p><p>Regional cardiac tamponade is most often seen after pericardiotomy or myocardial infarction. Clinical suspicion should be heightened in these settings. Establishing the diagnosis is challenging and may require additional echocardiographic views (eg, subcostal or transesophageal) and other advanced imaging techniques (eg, computed tomography).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSICAL FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of findings may be present on physical examination, depending upon the type and severity of cardiac tamponade, although none of the findings alone are highly sensitive or specific for the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tamponade/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The findings associated with Beck's triad, namely&nbsp;low arterial blood pressure, dilated neck veins, and muffled heart sounds, are present in only a minority of cases of&nbsp;acute cardiac tamponade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tamponade/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Physical findings such as sinus tachycardia, even in the absence of frank hypotension, may indicate significant hemodynamic compromise from cardiac tamponade and serve as an indication for immediate pericardiocentesis. In contrast, Kussmaul's sign (the absence of an inspiratory decline in jugular venous pressure) is not usually seen in cardiac tamponade. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Sinus tachycardia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sinus tachycardia is seen in almost all patients, allowing for at least partial maintenance of cardiac output. One exception is when the underlying disease is associated with bradycardia, as with a pericardial effusion and subacute cardiac tamponade associated with hypothyroidism. Tachycardia also may not be seen in patients with early cardiac tamponade even though they have signs of a hemodynamically significant effusion, such as an elevated jugular venous pressure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Elevated jugular venous pressure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The jugular venous pressure is almost always elevated in cardiac tamponade and may be associated with venous distension in the forehead and scalp. The x descent is preserved, while the y descent is attenuated or absent because of the limited or absent late diastolic filling of the ventricle. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=examination-of-the-jugular-venous-pulse\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Examination of the jugular venous pulse&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Pulsus paradoxus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pulsus paradoxus, defined as an abnormally large decrease in systolic blood pressure (&gt;10 mmHg) on inspiration, is a common finding in moderate to severe cardiac tamponade and is the direct consequence of ventricular interdependence. The limitation on outward expansion of the right ventricle as blood flows in during inspiration, along with relative underfilling of the left ventricle during inspiration, results in bulging of the interventricular septum into the left ventricle. Both the bulging of the interventricular septum and the reduction in left ventricular filling contribute to a large decrease in stroke volume (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F55709\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef55709 \">waveform 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F63439\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef63439 \">waveform 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F70731\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef70731 \">waveform 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tamponade/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. However, not all patients with cardiac tamponade have pulsus paradoxus (eg, those with chronic hypertension leading to elevated ventricular diastolic pressures or those with a co-existent atrial septal defect). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pulsus-paradoxus-in-pericardial-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pulsus paradoxus in pericardial disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Pericardial rub</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A pericardial rub may be heard in patients with cardiac tamponade due to inflammatory pericarditis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F56608\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef56608 \">movie 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tamponade/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Other imaging techniques, such as computed tomography (CT) and cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR), are not usually necessary for the diagnosis of a pericardial effusion if echocardiography is available.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Electrocardiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The electrocardiogram (ECG) in cardiac tamponade typically shows sinus tachycardia and may also show low voltage. If pericarditis is present, the ECG findings typical of that disorder are also seen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F77572\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef77572 \">waveform 4</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-treatment-of-pericardial-effusion#H4463173\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and treatment of pericardial effusion&quot;, section on 'ECG findings'</a>.)</p><p>Electrical alternans is characterized by beat-to-beat alterations in the QRS complex and, in some cases, other electrocardiographic waves that reflect the swinging of the heart in the pericardial fluid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F72525\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef72525 \">waveform 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F66715\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef66715 \">movie 2</a>). Electrical alternans is relatively specific but not very sensitive for cardiac tamponade; rarely, this phenomenon is seen with very large pericardial effusions alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tamponade/abstract/1,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ecg-tutorial-miscellaneous-diagnoses#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ECG tutorial: Miscellaneous diagnoses&quot;, section on 'Electrical alternans'</a>.)</p><p>It has been suggested that low QRS voltage in patients with a pericardial effusion is actually a specific manifestation of cardiac tamponade, not of the effusion. This possibility was illustrated in a study of 43 patients with a pericardial effusion; cardiac tamponade was present in 23 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tamponade/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Low QRS voltage (defined as maximum QRS amplitude &lt;0.5 mV in the limb leads) was found in 14 of the 23 patients with cardiac tamponade (61 percent) but in none with effusion without cardiac tamponade. The low voltage resolved within one week after treatment of cardiac tamponade by either pericardiocentesis or anti-inflammatory medications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Chest radiograph</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A chest radiograph showing an enlarged cardiac silhouette with clear lung fields may be seen in slowly developing cardiac tamponade (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F57640\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef57640 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tamponade/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Cardiomegaly is not usually seen in acute cardiac tamponade since at least 200 mL of pericardial fluid must accumulate before the cardiac silhouette enlarges [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tamponade/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In general, however, the findings on a chest radiograph are neither sensitive nor specific for the diagnosis of cardiac tamponade.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Echocardiography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although cardiac tamponade is a clinical diagnosis, two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography play major roles in the identification of pericardial effusion and in assessing its hemodynamic significance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tamponade/abstract/2,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,10</a>]. The use of echocardiography for the evaluation of all patients with suspected pericardial disease was highly recommended by a 2003 task force of the American College of Cardiology (ACC), the American Heart Association (AHA), and the American Society of Echocardiography (ASE) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tamponade/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The 2015 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Guidelines recommend echocardiography as the initial imaging technique to assess the hemodynamic impact of a pericardial effusion and a judicious clinical evaluation that includes echocardiographic findings to guide the timing of pericardiocentesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tamponade/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In patients who do not have cardiac tamponade on initial assessment, but in whom the suspicion is high, repeat echocardiography during clinical follow-up may be appropriate to detect early signs of developing cardiac tamponade in the presence of large or rapidly accumulating effusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tamponade/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>In most cases of cardiac tamponade, a moderate to large effusion is present, and swinging of the heart within the effusion may be seen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F66715\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef66715 \">movie 2</a>). Echocardiographic findings suggesting hemodynamic compromise are the result of transiently reversed right atrial and right ventricular diastolic transmural pressures. Cardiac chamber collapse typically occurs before clinical hemodynamic failure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-pericardium\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Echocardiographic evaluation of the pericardium&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The following are the major echocardiographic signs of cardiac tamponade, which may not be seen in all patients due to other underlying conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tamponade/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chamber collapse &ndash; Collapse of any cardiac chamber, but usually the right sided chambers, occurs when intrapericardial pressure exceeds intracardiac pressure within a particular chamber [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tamponade/abstract/10,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,18</a>]. Both the right atrium and right ventricle are compliant structures.

Echocardiography is critically important in making this distinction, as it may identify other cardiac pathology consistent with congestive heart failure or constrictive pericarditis. In addition, patients with cirrhosis typically have jaundice and abnormalities of hepatic synthetic function (eg, elevated prothrombin time).

This becomes apparent during pericardiocentesis in patients initially considered to have uncomplicated cardiac tamponade. In such cases, the right atrial pressure remains abnormal after removal of the pericardial effusion due to constriction by the visceral pericardium. In a study of 205 consecutive patients undergoing pericardiocentesis, effusive-constrictive disease was diagnosed in 16 percent; although baseline clinical and laboratory findings were generally similar, early diastolic mitral septal annular velocities were significantly higher, and respirophasic septal shifts and hepatic vein flow reversal were more common in the effusive-constrictive than the non-effusive-constrictive group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tamponade/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

Effusions which progressively enlarge, lead to worsening symptoms suggestive definite cardiac tamponade, or which are otherwise refractory to a conservative approach should be treated with pericardial fluid drainage.

Pericardiocentesis is technically more challenging, with more associated risk, if there is less than 1 cm of effusion.

The cause of this complication is unknown. It has been reported in association with concurrent left ventricular dysfunction, a setting in which the acute increase in venous return can promote pulmonary edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tamponade/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. However, pulmonary edema can occur in patients without apparent myocardial disease, suggesting that other mechanisms must be important. Acute dilation of the right ventricle following pericardiocentesis is also rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tamponade/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Ultimately, however, the risk to the patient of ongoing cardiac tamponade is generally greater than the risk of either of these potential complications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21697578\"><span class=\"h2\">Additional therapies</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Volume repletion &ndash; Patients with cardiac tamponade may require volume expansion with agents such as blood, plasma, dextran, or saline, but only as a temporizing measure until therapeutic pericardial fluid drainage can be performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tamponade/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The effects of volume replacement were shown to be variable in a study of 49 patients with a large pericardial effusion and hemodynamic criteria for cardiac tamponade who were given 500 mL of intravenous normal saline over 10 minutes; cardiac index increased by &gt;10 percent in 47 percent of patients, remained unchanged in 22 percent, and decreased in 31 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tamponade/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Volume expansion significantly increased intrapericardial pressure, right atrial pressure, and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. Systolic blood pressure &lt;100 mmHg was predictive of a favorable response to volume expansion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inotropic agents &ndash; In patients with cardiac tamponade, the value of inotropic support, with or without vasodilators, is uncertain. In theory, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a> might be the preferred agent to reverse the hypotension, but endogenous inotropic stimulation is often maximal in patients with cardiac tamponade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tamponade/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Positive pressure ventilation &ndash; In patients with cardiac tamponade, positive pressure mechanical ventilation should be avoided, if possible, because the positive thoracic pressures can further impair cardiac filling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tamponade/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Among patients with cardiac arrest and pericardial effusion, the benefit of external cardiac compression is markedly reduced since additional cardiac filling is difficult to achieve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-tamponade/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1765883690\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Types of cardiac tamponade include acute, subacute, low pressure (occult), and regional. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Physiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A key feature of cardiac tamponade is greatly enhanced ventricular interaction or interdependence, in which the hemodynamics of the left and right heart chambers are directly influenced by each other to a much greater degree than normal. Heightened ventricular interdependence coupled with progressive systolic predominance of an inspiratory increase in systemic venous return are largely responsible for the diagnostic physical and imaging signs. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Physiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presenting symptoms of cardiac tamponade vary according to the acuteness of the presentation:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with acute cardiac tamponade typically have chest pain, dyspnea, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> tachypnea associated with trauma or a cardiac procedure. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Acute cardiac tamponade'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with subacute, low pressure, or regional cardiac tamponade most commonly present with one or more of the following: fatigue, dyspnea, chest pain, and edema. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Subacute cardiac tamponade'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Low pressure cardiac tamponade'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Regional cardiac tamponade'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A number of findings may be present on physical examination, depending upon the type and severity of cardiac tamponade. These may include sinus tachycardia, elevated jugular venous pressure, hypotension, and an exaggerated inspiratory decrease in systolic blood pressure (pulsus paradoxus). (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Physical findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients suspected of having cardiac tamponade should be evaluated with an electrocardiogram, chest radiograph, and echocardiography. (See <a href=\"#H242973981\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac tamponade can be suspected based on the history and physical examination, electrocardiogram (tachycardia, low voltage, electrical alternans), chest x-ray (enlarged cardiac silhouette with clear lung fields), and echocardiogram (chamber collapses, abnormal venous flows, exaggerated respiratory variation of cardiac and venous flows). However, the diagnosis of cardiac tamponade can best be confirmed by the hemodynamic and clinical response to pericardial fluid drainage. (See <a href=\"#H242973994\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Definitive treatment of cardiac tamponade is achieved by removal of the pericardial fluid. While an occasional patient with few or no clinical signs of hemodynamic compromise may be observed with serial physical examinations and echocardiograms, most patients with cardiac tamponade will require early drainage of the pericardial effusion. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In patients with a documented pericardial effusion and clinical evidence of hemodynamic compromise (ie, tachycardia and hypotension producing a picture of cardiogenic shock) consistent with cardiac tamponade, urgent drainage of the pericardial effusion should be performed. Drainage of the effusion can be performed percutaneously using catheter drainage or surgically. (See <a href=\"#H21697510\" class=\"local\">'Choosing percutaneous or surgical drainage'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In patients with a documented large pericardial effusion who are hemodynamically stable without evidence of cardiac tamponade, and in whom sampling the fluid is not needed for diagnostic purposes, we suggest initial observation with serial physical examinations and echocardiograms rather than urgent drainage of the pericardial effusion (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following either percutaneous or surgical drainage of a pericardial effusion in a patient with cardiac tamponade, the patient should be monitored with continuous telemetry and frequent vital signs for at least 24 to 48 hours. Subsequent monitoring with two-dimensional and Doppler echocardiography prior to discharge from the hospital is warranted to confirm adequate fluid removal and to detect possible recurrent fluid accumulation. (See <a href=\"#H21697548\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring post-procedure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intravenous volume repletion <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> inotropic support may prove temporarily beneficial in patients with cardiac tamponade, but these therapies should be considered as temporizing measures until therapeutic drainage of the pericardial effusion can be performed.
