These nests or islands of luteinized theca cells are scattered throughout the stroma of the ovary, rather than being confined to areas around cystic follicles as in the polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The result is greater production of androgens. The precise etiology of ovarian hyperthecosis is still unclear.</p><p>The clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of ovarian hyperthecosis are discussed here.

Women typically present with slowly progressive acne and hirsutism (eg, excessive male-pattern hair growth), and they are likely to be virilized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-hyperthecosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Thus, many have clitoral enlargement, male-pattern baldness, deepening of the voice, and a male habitus.</p><p>In almost all cases, insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia are present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-hyperthecosis/abstract/3,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5</a>], and women are at increased risk for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-hyperthecosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Additional physical findings may include central obesity, skin tags, and acanthosis nigricans.</p><p>The ovarian secretion of large amounts of testosterone in women with hyperthecosis means that peripheral estrogen production is increased. As a result, the risk of endometrial hyperplasia and endometrial carcinoma is increased, especially in postmenopausal women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-hyperthecosis/abstract/2,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6</a>].</p><p>Among premenopausal women who present with hyperandrogenism, the vast majority have polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and, only rarely, ovarian hyperthecosis. These disease entities may be difficult to distinguish from each other and may all be part of the same spectrum of hyperandrogenic conditions. However, the hirsutism and insulin resistance are more severe in women with ovarian hyperthecosis compared with those with PCOS.</p><p>Ovarian hyperthecosis is mainly observed in postmenopausal women. This could be best explained by &quot;the two-cell hypothesis&quot; wherein persistent (gonadotropin-driven) testosterone secretion by ovarian theca cells is unmasked postmenopausally through the loss of granulosa cell-mediated aromatization of testosterone to estradiol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-hyperthecosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H952680715\"><span class=\"h2\">Biochemical findings</span></p><p>Patients with hyperthecosis typically have the following biochemical findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum total testosterone concentrations &gt;150 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL</span> (&gt;5.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-hyperthecosis/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>].

However, this procedure should <strong>not </strong>be performed routinely, as it is technically difficult, and there is no consensus on the testosterone gradient that localizes the androgen source [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-hyperthecosis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

It is possible that a two-hour oral glucose tolerance test is more sensitive in this population (as it is in women with PCOS), but this has not yet been established.

Women with androgen-secreting tumors typically present with rapid onset and progression of hirsutism and virilization. Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be useful for differentiating between androgen-secreting ovarian tumors and ovarian hyperthecosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-hyperthecosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

Total treatment duration was between 8 and 13 months; after stopping therapy, testosterone concentrations remained low in two but increased again in the third.

In postmenopausal women and premenopausal women who have completed childbearing, the main aim is to lower androgen levels by bilateral oophorectomy or GnRH agonist treatment. In premenopausal women, symptomatic treatment of hirsutism and ovulation induction for infertility may be indicated. Additional treatment should aim at reducing weight and insulin resistance. (See <a href=\"#H14632546\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14646679\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Manubai Nagamani, MD, and Jolande Land, MD, PhD, who contributed to earlier versions of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ovarian-hyperthecosis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Goldman JM, Kapadia LJ.
