LSc rarely progresses into a systemic form [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localized-scleroderma-in-childhood/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>] and can sometimes merge or overlap with eosinophilic fasciitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eosinophilic-fasciitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Eosinophilic fasciitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic will review the incidence, etiology, diagnosis, and management of LSc in children. JSSc and the pathogenesis of SSc are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=juvenile-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Juvenile systemic sclerosis (scleroderma)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-systemic-sclerosis-scleroderma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of systemic sclerosis (scleroderma)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>LSc has been differentiated from systemic sclerosis (SSc) based upon the clinical findings of almost exclusive cutaneous involvement (typically with some involvement of the underlying musculature) with absence of internal organ involvement. This distinction may not be as clear as previously thought as a significant minority of patients who present initially as LSc develop extracutaneous findings during the course of their disease. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Extracutaneous manifestations'</a> below.)</p><p>The outcome for most children with LSc depends upon the type and extent of the lesion. The major problem in untreated patients is not survival, but morbidity as a result of skin, muscle, and bone atrophy; growth defects; and deformities of varying severity, mostly seen in patients with linear morphea and deep morphea. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Linear scleroderma'</a> below and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Pansclerotic morphea'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Classification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The forms of LSc are distinguished by the distribution of skin lesions and other associated findings. The most widely used classification divides LSc into five types (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F79254\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79254 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localized-scleroderma-in-childhood/abstract/1,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Circumscribed (plaque) morphea &ndash; This is the most benign form of LSc and the most common of the morphea types. It is confined to the dermis with occasional involvement of the superficial panniculus or subcutaneous tissue (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F73912\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73912 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F79820\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79820 \">picture 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F73941\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73941 \">picture 4</a>). Plaques are discrete, few in number, and confined to two or less anatomic areas. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Circumscribed (plaque) morphea'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Generalized morphea &ndash; This form of LSc occurs when there are &ge;4 plaques that affect two or more anatomic sites and become confluent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F68904%7EDERM%2F56113\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68904 graphicRef56113 \">picture 5A-B</a>). Generalized morphea can be superficial or deep. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Generalized morphea'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Linear scleroderma &ndash; This is the most common type of LSc in children. The fibrotic lesion is elongated, and the direction is usually transverse when on the trunk and longitudinal on the limbs. When the lesion involves the face or scalp, it is referred to as &quot;<em>en coup de sabre</em>&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F78212\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef78212 \">picture 6</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F75258\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef75258 \">picture 7</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62452\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62452 \">picture 8</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F73173\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73173 \">picture 9</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F80877\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80877 \">picture 10</a>). Patients may develop contractures and defects of the limb with associated poor growth and disabilities. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Linear scleroderma'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pansclerotic morphea &ndash; This is the least common but the most disabling form of LSc. The primary site of involvement is the panniculus or subcutaneous tissue. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Pansclerotic morphea'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mixed scleroderma &ndash; A combination of two or more of the other subtypes. (See <a href=\"#H13148703\" class=\"local\">'Mixed scleroderma'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Bullous involvement, although very rare, may occur in LSc including plaque morphea and linear scleroderma. The bullous lesions may be the result of localized trauma or lymphatic obstruction secondary to the sclerodermatous process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localized-scleroderma-in-childhood/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although LSc is uncommon, it is 10 times more common than systemic sclerosis (SSc) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localized-scleroderma-in-childhood/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Few studies have addressed the incidence or prevalence of this disorder in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localized-scleroderma-in-childhood/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. A study in the UK and Ireland has estimated an incidence rate of 3.4 cases per million children per year age &lt;16 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localized-scleroderma-in-childhood/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Linear morphea is the predominant form in childhood as compared with circumscribed morphea, which is predominant in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localized-scleroderma-in-childhood/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. LSc has been reported at birth in six neonates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localized-scleroderma-in-childhood/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. All of these patients with so-called &quot;congenital LSc&quot; had linear morphea, of which four involved the face with an <em>en coup de sabre</em> appearance. At this age, LSc can be misdiagnosed as skin infection, nevus, or salmon patch, and this may lead to a delay in diagnosis.</p><p>Further evidence that LSc is relatively uncommon in children is illustrated by a report from a pediatric rheumatology center that found that only 2 percent of all referred patients had LSc [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localized-scleroderma-in-childhood/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, LSc may be underreported because of bias of referral patterns and misdiagnosis as other cutaneous diseases have sclerodermatous changes resembling LSc. As an example, the <em>en coup de sabre </em>subtype of linear morphea may be misdiagnosed as alopecia. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The etiology and pathogenesis of LSc remain uncertain. Two possible contributing pathogenic processes include abnormal fibroblast function and autoimmune dysfunction.</p><p>The skin lesion of LSc demonstrates an initial marked inflammatory reaction, followed by matrix deposition (including collagen), fibrosis, and ultimately atrophy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F62616\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62616 \">picture 1</a>). Because of these histologic changes, investigations have focused on abnormal regulation of collagen production by fibroblasts. As an example, one study demonstrated increased collagen production by fibroblasts in skin biopsy specimens from patients with morphea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localized-scleroderma-in-childhood/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In addition, raised levels of cytokines that increase collagen synthesis by fibroblasts have been reported in LSc lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localized-scleroderma-in-childhood/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Particular cytokine and chemokine profiles are seen in patients with LSc. A T helper cell type 1 (Th1, with interferon [IFN]-gamma) and T helper cell type 17 (Th17, with interleukin [IL]-17a) predominance was demonstrated in peripheral blood of patients with LSc compared with healthy controls. The IFN-gamma signature consisting of elevated IFN-gamma-induced protein 10 (IP-10, or C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 10 [CXCL10]), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1, or C-C motif chemokine ligand 2 [CCL2]), and IFN-gamma is also seen in systemic sclerosis (SSc), suggesting a shared pathophysiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localized-scleroderma-in-childhood/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Autoimmune dysfunction as a contributing cause of LSc is supported by the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with LSc, there is an increased incidence of autoimmune disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localized-scleroderma-in-childhood/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. The most commonly associated diseases include Hashimoto's thyroiditis, vitiligo, and type 1 diabetes mellitus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localized-scleroderma-in-childhood/abstract/17-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-22</a>]. Relatives of affected patients also have an increased incidence of autoimmune disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localized-scleroderma-in-childhood/abstract/9,17,18,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,17,18,23</a>]. Two studies reported a 12 percent incidence of a positive family history for rheumatic or autoimmune diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localized-scleroderma-in-childhood/abstract/9,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Biopsies of linear morphea have similar histologic findings to those seen in skin lesions of patients with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), and morphea-like lesions are seen in chronic GVHD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localized-scleroderma-in-childhood/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. For this reason, it has been proposed that nonself cells or chimerism may be involved in the pathogenesis of LSc. In one study, tissue biopsies of morphea were found to contain chimeric-infiltrating cells, which were primarily epithelial cells surrounded by CD4, CD8 T cells, and B cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localized-scleroderma-in-childhood/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. These findings resembled lymphoid aggregates, which have been reported in other autoimmune processes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The presence of immature chimeric cells in LSc lesions suggests a possible role for chimerism in the pathogenesis of this disease, similar to other autoimmune diseases, such as juvenile dermatomyositis, neonatal lupus, Sj&ouml;gren's syndrome, and systemic scleroderma.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Autoantibodies are a frequent finding in patients with LSc [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localized-scleroderma-in-childhood/abstract/9,17,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,17,23</a>]. Relatives of affected patients also have an increase in organ-specific autoantibodies compared with control patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localized-scleroderma-in-childhood/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Unlike many autoimmune diseases, there appears to be no significant increased risk for LSc in family members.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Similar to adult sclerosis, numerous etiologic agents have been suggested as possible causes of LSc, including drugs and environmental toxins, local trauma, and infection. However, no definitive link has been established in any of these.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drugs and environmental toxins that have been associated with scleroderma-like skin reactions include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bleomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bleomycin</a>, ergot, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bromocriptine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bromocriptine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pentazocine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pentazocine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbidopa-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbidopa</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-k-phytonadione-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin K</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localized-scleroderma-in-childhood/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In a large, multicenter, retrospective review of 750 patients, 13.3 percent of the patients reported specific environmental events as a potential trigger for their disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localized-scleroderma-in-childhood/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. These included infections, drugs, mechanical events (eg, accidental trauma, insect bite, and vaccination), and psychological stress.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trauma has been implicated in the initiation of morphea lesions and also with the onset of eosinophilic fasciitis. A history of trauma has been reported in 3 to 13 percent of patients with LSc [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localized-scleroderma-in-childhood/abstract/9,23,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,23,27</a>]. The underlying pathogenesis of how trauma would contribute to development of LSc is unclear. Although cytokines and neuropeptides (eg, endothelin-1), which are normally involved in wound healing, have been suggested to play a causative role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localized-scleroderma-in-childhood/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], there is no confirmatory evidence.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Since the first report of a patient with linear morphea and <em>Borrelia burgdorferi </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localized-scleroderma-in-childhood/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], investigations have focused on whether this spirochete, which causes Lyme disease, may play an etiologic role in LSc [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localized-scleroderma-in-childhood/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>]. However, patients with morphea who live in nonendemic areas have no evidence of <em>Borrelia</em> infection, as documented by negative serologic testing and polymerase chain reaction tests in skin biopsy specimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localized-scleroderma-in-childhood/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although circumscribed morphea and linear morphea are often described as separate forms of LSc, it is common for patients to have overlapping lesions. This possible evolution should be monitored carefully because linear morphea is associated with greater morbidity and increased complication rates than circumscribed morphea.</p><p>In a large, retrospective, multicenter review of 750 children with LSc, the most common subtype was linear morphea (65 percent), followed by circumscribed morphea (26 percent), generalized morphea (7 percent), and deep morphea (2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localized-scleroderma-in-childhood/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. However, 15 percent of patients had clinical features that overlapped and were defined as a mixed subtype. In 12 percent of patients, there was a family history of rheumatic or autoimmune diseases. Overall, the mean age of presentation was 7.3 years (range 0 to 16 years, median age 6.1 years).</p><p>The most widely used classification divides juvenile LSc into five general types: circumscribed morphea, linear scleroderma, generalized morphea, pansclerotic morphea, and a mixed subtype where a combination of two or more of the previous subtypes is present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localized-scleroderma-in-childhood/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Classification'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Circumscribed (plaque) morphea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Circumscribed morphea is the most benign form of LSc. These lesions are confined to the dermis with only occasional involvement of the superficial panniculus (subcutaneous tissue). Plaques are discrete, few in number, and confined to one anatomic area. Depending on the shape and size of the lesions, various subtypes of circumscribed morphea have been described (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F79820\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79820 \">picture 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F73941\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73941 \">picture 4</a>).</p><p>It is characterized by oval or round, circumscribed areas of induration with a central, waxy, ivory color surrounded by a violaceous halo (the &quot;lilac ring&quot;) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F73912\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73912 \">picture 2</a>). The plaques are typically several centimeters in diameter and occur most frequently on the trunk, less often on the limbs, and infrequently on the face. Plaques evolve through several stages:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial erythematous inflammatory stage</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sclerotic indurated phase with surrounding inflammation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Softening and dermal atrophy phase with associated hypo- or hyperpigmentation</p><p/><p>These lesions usually self-resolve within three to five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localized-scleroderma-in-childhood/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], although a patch may sometimes persist. New patches occasionally appear many years after initial presentation.</p><p>Other variants of this subtype include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Guttate morphea &ndash; Guttate morphea is less common and frequently involves the shoulders and chest. Lesions are multiple, small (2 to 10 mm in diameter), hypopigmented and pigmented papules with minimal sclerosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F55918\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55918 \">picture 11</a>). The epidermis is thin and atrophic, resembling lichen sclerosus et atrophicus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Keloid morphea &ndash; Keloid morphea, also known as &quot;nodular morphea,&quot; is a rare condition characterized by indurated plaques that resemble posttraumatic scars. Keloid morphea can be several centimeters in diameter and is found either as a single lesion or as multiple lesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F54463\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54463 \">picture 12</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atrophoderma of Pasini and Pierini &ndash; This subtype usually involves the trunk and is characterized by hyperpigmented atrophic patches with well-demarcated borders. It may exist with other types of sclerotic lesions or represent the involutionary phase of morphea en plaque.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Morphea profunda &ndash; Circumscribed induration of the skin can sometimes involve subcutaneous tissue and extend into fascia and underlying muscle. The skin appears bound down with a solitary lesion or multiple indurated plaques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localized-scleroderma-in-childhood/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subcutaneous morphea &ndash; The primary site of involvement is the subcutaneous tissue without involvement of the skin. These plaques are hyperpigmented, symmetric, and somewhat ill defined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localized-scleroderma-in-childhood/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Generalized morphea</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Generalized morphea, which can be superficial or deep, is defined by the presence of &ge;4 plaques involving at least two different anatomic sites (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F68904%7EDERM%2F56113\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef68904 graphicRef56113 \">picture 5A-B</a>). Usually, the trunk and legs are involved, and the acral (fingers, toes, or ears) parts are spared. Onset of induration is rapid over a period of several months, and the degree of inflammation is greater than in other subtypes. Generalized morphea can extend, resulting in disfigurement and contractures, disability, and ulcerations that, on rare occasions, become malignant.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Linear scleroderma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This is the most frequent form of LSc. The fibrotic lesion is elongated into an appearance of linear bands. Limbs are more commonly affected than the face. Plaque direction is usually transverse in the trunk and longitudinal in the extremities. Recurrence in LSc occurs in almost one-quarter of patients and is more frequent in the linear subtype involving the limbs, independent of the age of disease onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localized-scleroderma-in-childhood/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].</p><p>There is considerable debate on whether these lesions follow specific dermatomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localized-scleroderma-in-childhood/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. One theory speculates the involved distribution reflects an abnormal migration of neuroepidermal cells during embryogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localized-scleroderma-in-childhood/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. This theory is supported by the frequent development of seizures, hemiparesis, and headaches during the evolution of a facial lesion called <em>en coup de sabre</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localized-scleroderma-in-childhood/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

Tests for anticentromere and antitopoisomerase are rarely positive (1.7 and 3.2 percent, respectively).</p><p>Elevated markers of inflammation (eg, erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR] and C-reactive protein), as well as positive ANA and rheumatoid factor (RF), are more frequently seen in patients with LSc who have extracutaneous manifestations than those with only skin involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localized-scleroderma-in-childhood/abstract/18,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,23</a>].

It is classified into five types based upon the extent of disease: circumscribed (plaque) morphea, generalized morphea (superficial or deep), linear scleroderma, pansclerotic morphea, and mixed scleroderma. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Localized disease principally involves the skin, subcutaneous fascia, muscle, and bone, although a quarter of patients will have extracutaneous findings. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Extracutaneous manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment needs to be individualized and be matched to both the type of LSc and stage of disease. Care should include advice on skin-softening agents, exercise to maintain functional ability, pharmacologic therapy, and, if indicated, surgery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest <strong>not</strong> treating a single-localized lesion with systemic therapy, unless it crosses a joint line and produces contracture (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). Emollients (any lanolin-based cream) and low-concentration weak topical corticosteroids (1% <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> cream) may relieve dryness and itching.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For pansclerotic morphea, progressive linear scleroderma crossing joint lines or involving the face (<em>en coup de sabre</em>), or generalized morphea, we recommend treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> for at least 24 months, in combination with oral glucocorticoids for the first two to three months (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F77267\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77267 \">table 2</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>).</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/localized-scleroderma-in-childhood/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Fett N, Werth VP.
