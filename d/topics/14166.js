The use of prolonged fasting intervals prior to sedation for urgent or emergent procedures remains an area of practice difference among clinicians providing sedation and anesthesia for children. Evidence regarding the optimum duration of fasting required to reduce the risk of aspiration during pediatric procedural sedation is limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparation-for-pediatric-procedural-sedation-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p>Aspiration of gastric contents during anesthesia or sedation is a rare, though much feared complication. Based upon one prospective observational study of over 139,000 elective pediatric sedations performed outside of the operating room, aspiration occurred in approximately 1 in 10,000 sedations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparation-for-pediatric-procedural-sedation-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Patients undergoing emergency procedures that require sedation are thought to be at increased risk of aspiration because fasting has often not occurred and the procedure cannot be delayed. In addition, the underlying condition (eg, pyloric stenosis, duodenal hematoma, surgical abdomen, history of severe gastroesophageal reflux) and severity of illness (eg, major trauma) may also increase aspiration risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparation-for-pediatric-procedural-sedation-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Aspiration does not always cause harm. However, aspirated gastric contents above a critical volume and acidity can cause severe respiratory and systemic consequences, including death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparation-for-pediatric-procedural-sedation-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The importance of fasting for preventing aspiration during procedural sedation remains unclear, and there is no direct evidence linking the duration of fasting prior to procedural sedation and the likelihood of aspiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparation-for-pediatric-procedural-sedation-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/18-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-23</a>]. Problems, such as major trauma, can decrease the rapidity of gastric emptying, thus making the usual fasting intervals less reliably protective. In addition, observational studies that have evaluated the incidence of aspiration in children undergoing anesthesia have shown that the presence of underlying pathology (such as bowel obstruction) is more closely associated with aspiration risk than the timing of the last oral intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparation-for-pediatric-procedural-sedation-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6183696\"><span class=\"h3\">Elective procedures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We and the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA), the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American Academy of Dentistry suggest that children, undergoing sedation for scheduled <strong>elective</strong> procedures outside of the operating room, fast as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparation-for-pediatric-procedural-sedation-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two hours after receiving clear liquids</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Four hours after breast feeding</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Six hours after ingesting non-fatty solid foods (eg, toast or bananas), formula, or milk other than human milk</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eight hours after full meals </p><p/><p>Of these intervals, the impact of time since ingestion of clear liquids has been best studied. In a systematic review of 23 randomized trials of preoperative fasting regimens for children at normal risk for aspiration during anesthesia, fasting for two hours preoperatively had no clinically important difference in intraoperative gastric volume or pH and provided greater patient comfort when compared to six hours of complete fasting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparation-for-pediatric-procedural-sedation-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Although fasting to reduce the risk of aspiration during sedation or elective surgery makes intuitive sense, there is little evidence that this approach actually prevents aspiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparation-for-pediatric-procedural-sedation-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/15,20,21,24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,20,21,24-26</a>]. For example, in a prospective observational study of over 139,000 children undergoing elective sedation by a dedicated sedation service in the outpatient setting, of whom almost one-quarter did not meet ASA fasting criteria, 10 aspirations and 75 major complications occurred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparation-for-pediatric-procedural-sedation-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Fasting status was not an independent predictor of either aspiration (odds ratio [OR] 0.8, 95% CI: 0.1-4.1) or major complications (OR 1.1, 95% CI: 0.6-1.9). However, the relationship between fasting duration and aspiration or major complications remains uncertain given the low number of events despite a very large sample size. &#160; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6183703\"><span class=\"h3\">Urgent or emergent procedures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The degree of fasting prior to procedural sedation for urgent or emergent procedures is controversial and disparate recommendations have been proposed by the American Society of Anesthesiologists, the American Academy of Pediatrics, and the American College of Emergency Physicians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparation-for-pediatric-procedural-sedation-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/6,10,21,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,10,21,27</a>]. </p><p>We advise the following approach to reducing aspiration risk for children undergoing sedation for urgent or emergent<strong> </strong>procedures outside of the operating room:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Carefully consider the risks and benefits of performing the procedure in patients who do not meet American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) fasting guidelines (see <a href=\"#H6183696\" class=\"local\">'Elective procedures'</a> above).

In 2007, an expert panel of general and pediatric emergency physicians further suggested that the provider modify the depth and length of procedural sedation based upon the timing and nature of the last oral intake, the urgency of the procedure, and the risk for aspiration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F52081\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52081 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparation-for-pediatric-procedural-sedation-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p>In 2014, based upon the lack of evidence that fasting impacts the frequency of aspiration or other major complications after sedation, ACEP further modified their stance to recommend that procedural sedation not be delayed in adults or children receiving care in the emergency department based upon fasting time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparation-for-pediatric-procedural-sedation-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

Children with ASA classes I and II are generally reasonable candidates for mild, moderate, and deep sedation outside of the operating room. In most instances, those patients with ASA classes III, IV, and V, special needs, or airway abnormalities warrant consultation with a pediatric anesthesiologist or clinician with specific pediatric sedation expertise (eg, emergency physician, pediatric intensivist) who regularly provides sedation for children with severe systematic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparation-for-pediatric-procedural-sedation-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Because depression of consciousness is a continuum (except for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ketamine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ketamine</a>) and responses to medications vary, clinicians must be able to deal with complications in patients whose level of sedation becomes deeper than intended or who experience an adverse reaction to medication. Competence in emergency airway management is mandatory if deep sedation is intended or possible and is strongly advised for lighter levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparation-for-pediatric-procedural-sedation-outside-of-the-operating-room/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Administration of sedation requires at least two individuals, typically an advanced practice clinician (eg, physician, physician's assistant, advanced practice registered nurse, nurse anesthetist) and an assistant. In addition to the assistant, it is preferable to have two advanced practice clinicians present (one to administer the sedation, while the other performs the procedure) whenever possible for patients undergoing moderate to deep sedation. At least one person present should have training in pediatric resuscitation and be skilled in airway management and cardiopulmonary resuscitation.

(See <a href=\"#H1560685\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should be evaluated prior to the procedure for their suitability for sedation. The history should include allergies, use of medications, diseases and hospitalizations, previous exposure to sedation or general anesthesia, relevant family history, and the time and content of their last oral intake. Physical examination should include auscultation of the heart and lungs and evaluation of the neck and airway for conditions that might interfere with endotracheal intubation or resuscitation. (See <a href=\"#H1560692\" class=\"local\">'Pre-sedation evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We and the American Society of Anesthesiology suggest that children, undergoing sedation for scheduled <strong>elective</strong> procedures outside of the operating room, fast two hours for clear liquids; four hours for breast milk; and six hours for formula, non-human milk, non-fatty solids (eg, toast, bananas) prior to sedation, and eight hours for full meals (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The strength of this recommendation recognizes that guidelines for fasting and sedation outside of the operating room are based upon expert consensus. Aspiration is a rare, but potentially life-threatening event after sedation. Thus, superiority of a particular approach to fasting is difficult to demonstrate. (See <a href=\"#H6183696\" class=\"local\">'Elective procedures'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children who may require urgent or emergency procedural sedation should receive nothing by mouth throughout their initial evaluation. Fasting status and the urgency of the procedure should be used to determine the timing of sedation, target depth of sedation, and the specific agents used, but recent oral intake is <strong>not</strong> a contraindication for emergency procedural sedation. (See <a href=\"#H6183703\" class=\"local\">'Urgent or emergent procedures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pre-sedation evaluation should identify children who may experience serious adverse events with sedation in accordance with the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification system and those with a potential difficult airway. Healthy patients or those with mild systemic disease (ASA class I or II) and no evidence of a difficult airway are suitable candidates for procedural sedation outside of the operating room. Patients with severe or poorly controlled systemic disease (ASA class III, IV, or V) or a strong potential for a difficult airway warrant the involvement of a pediatric anesthesiologist or clinician with similar pediatric sedation expertise. (See <a href=\"#H1560699\" class=\"local\">'Risk classification'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11046848\" class=\"local\">'Airway assessment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Personnel should have the ability to manage possible complications. Specifically, they must be able to recognize the patient who is compromised and have the necessary skills to intervene. These skills include, at a minimum, the ability to maintain the child's airway with repositioning and to provide bag-mask ventilation. (See <a href=\"#H1560713\" class=\"local\">'Personnel'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Administration of sedation requires at least two individuals, typically an advanced practice clinician (eg, physician, physician's assistant, advanced nurse practitioner, nurse anesthetist) and an assistant.
