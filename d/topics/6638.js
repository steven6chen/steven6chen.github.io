However, as commonly used, the Budd-Chiari syndrome implies thrombosis of the hepatic veins <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the intrahepatic or suprahepatic inferior vena cava. An alternative nomenclature that recognizes an obliterative process involving principally the inferior vena cava (&quot;obliterative hepatocavopathy&quot;) has also been proposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-the-budd-chiari-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The term is usually distinguished from two other conditions that interfere with hepatic venous flow: sinusoidal obstruction syndrome (hepatic veno-occlusive disease) and right heart failure.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disorders that involve the microscopic centrilobular veins and small sublobular veins within the liver are usually due to nonthrombotic fibrous occlusion and obliteration of these small veins. The distinct anatomic location, pathology, and conditions (eg, ingestion of toxic pyrrolizidine alkaloids or exposure to high doses of radiation or chemotherapeutic agents) with which sinusoidal obstruction syndrome is associated allow it to be placed in its own category [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-the-budd-chiari-syndrome/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congestive-hepatopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congestive hepatopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Thus, the Budd-Chiari syndrome is due to occlusion or partial occlusion of one, two, or all three of the major hepatic veins (right, middle, and left) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> occlusion or partial occlusion of the inferior vein cava (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F81897\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81897 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-the-budd-chiari-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

In one study, for example, spontaneous endogenous erythroid colony formation in vitro <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bone marrow biopsies suggested that a primary myeloproliferative disorder was present in 78 percent of such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-the-budd-chiari-syndrome/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p><em>JAK2 </em>tyrosine kinase (V617F) mutations have been described in 26 to 59 percent of patients with Budd-Chiari syndrome, many of whom had negative results from standard testing for myeloproliferative disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-the-budd-chiari-syndrome/abstract/14,18,24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,18,24-26</a>]. A <em>JAK2</em> mutation is present in almost all patients with polycythemia vera and approximately 50 percent of patients with essential thrombocythemia or chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis.

Some of these disorders also may be accompanied by a hypercoagulable state. These lesions include hepatic cysts and abscesses, hepatic adenoma, hepatic mucinous cystic neoplasm (cystadenoma), syphilitic gumma, invasive aspergillosis, zygomycosis (mucormycosis), and aortic aneurysm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-the-budd-chiari-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Oral contraceptives and pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nearly 20 percent of cases of the Budd-Chiari syndrome occur in women who have been on oral contraceptives (for as little as two weeks), are pregnant, or have delivered a child within the previous two months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-of-the-budd-chiari-syndrome/abstract/29-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-33</a>].
