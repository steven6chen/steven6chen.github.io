Patients have the characteristic clinical features of microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) and thrombocytopenia, and they may have acute kidney injury (AKI), neurologic abnormalities, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cardiac ischemia.</p><p>Drug-induced TMA (DITMA) is especially challenging to diagnose because specific laboratory tests to identify a drug etiology may not be available, and the role of a potentially implicated drug or other ingested substance may not be clear. Some of the implicated substances are illegal and may not be volunteered by the patient, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quinine</a> exposure often is not recorded in the medication history when quinine is obtained without a prescription or ingested in a beverage such as tonic water. The principal treatment of DITMA is withdrawing the suspected drug. However, management of a patient with suspected DITMA may be challenging because the clinical diagnostic criteria for DITMA overlap with other primary TMAs (eg, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [TTP], complement-mediated TMA) that do require specific interventions (plasma exchange [PEX] and anticomplement therapy, respectively).</p><p>Here we discuss our approach to the evaluation and management of a patient with a suspected DITMA.</p><p>Separate topic reviews present an overview of our approach to the evaluation of a patient with unexplained MAHA and thrombocytopenia as well as related TMAs including TTP:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-suspected-ttp-hus-or-other-thrombotic-microangiopathy-tma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with suspected TTP, HUS, or other thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-ttp-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired TTP: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-ttp-initial-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired TTP: Initial treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complement-mediated-hemolytic-uremic-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complement-mediated hemolytic uremic syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hemolytic-uremic-syndrome-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hemolytic uremic syndrome in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-shiga-toxin-producing-escherichia-coli-stec-hemolytic-uremic-syndrome-hus-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10429223\"><span class=\"h1\">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Terminology for the thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) syndromes is evolving as disease understanding increases and diagnostic testing allows identification of specific causes.

There are major implications of this distinction, including differences in presentation, management, and prognosis. These differences are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H10429249\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> below and <a href=\"#H10429277\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> below and <a href=\"#H503583\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis/Expected recovery'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10429235\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>DITMA is an acquired condition resulting from exposure to a drug (eg, medication, other substance) that induces formation of drug-dependent antibodies or causes direct tissue toxicity that results in the formation of platelet-rich thrombi in small arterioles or capillaries. As with other TMAs, thrombocytopenia results from platelet consumption in microthrombi, and microangiopathic hemolysis occurs as red blood cells (RBCs) pass through these thrombi. Organ ischemia and infarction may also occur as a result of small-vessel thrombosis. The kidney appears to be especially susceptible in DITMA syndromes.</p><p>Additional information about the pathogenesis of microangiopathic hemolysis, thrombocytopenia, and pathologic lesions in TMA is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-acquired-ttp-and-other-primary-thrombotic-microangiopathies-tmas\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of acquired TTP and other primary thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21437823\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanism (immune-mediated)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In immune-mediated DITMA, the drug induces formation of antibodies that react with multiple cells, including platelets, neutrophils, and endothelial cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F112488\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef112488 \">figure 1</a>), but strong binding only occurs in the presence of the drug (or drug metabolite) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-thrombotic-microangiopathy/abstract/3-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-8</a>]. Therefore, these antibodies are described as drug-dependent antibodies.</p><p>The binding of drug-dependent antibodies to platelets is similar to drug-induced immune thrombocytopenia (DITP), but in DITP, platelets are the only cellular target of drug-dependent antibodies. In patients with DITMA, there may be multiple cellular targets that result in microvascular damage and formation of platelet microthrombi. Thrombocytopenia is thought to be due to platelet consumption in microthrombi. As with other immune-mediated drug reactions, the generation of antibodies requires previous or ongoing exposure to the drug, and the severity of the reaction is independent of the drug dose. Thus, severe reactions may occur rapidly following extremely small drug exposures (eg, the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quinine</a> in one sip of tonic water) (see <a href=\"#H590279569\" class=\"local\">'Quinine'</a> below). Antibodies in immune-mediated DITMA may be highly specific for the structure of the implicated drug [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-thrombotic-microangiopathy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Antibodies in immune-mediated DITMA require the presence of the drug (or a drug metabolite) to cause cellular damage. Thus, once the drug is cleared from the circulation (hours to days for most drugs), no new organ injury occurs. However, tissue damage (especially kidney injury) may recover slowly <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> incompletely, and therefore microangiopathic hemolytic anemia (MAHA) and thrombocytopenia may be slow to resolve. (See <a href=\"#H503583\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis/Expected recovery'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21437829\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanism (toxicity-mediated)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Toxicity-mediated (ie, non-antibody-mediated) DITMA may develop by multiple mechanisms. Many cases are dose related, occurring only after large cumulative exposure over a period of time or exposure to large single doses of a drug. Other cases may occur after a single exposure to an agent administered by an inappropriate route, apparently independent of the dose. Cytotoxic cancer chemotherapies are common examples of the former (see <a href=\"#H174813\" class=\"local\">'Cancer therapies'</a> below); intravenous rather than oral administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxymorphone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxymorphone</a> extended-release tablets intended for oral use (Opana ER) is thought to occur by the latter mechanism. (See <a href=\"#H1323021\" class=\"local\">'Drugs of abuse'</a> below.)</p><p>Toxicity-mediated DITMA is presumed to result from direct tissue injury from the implicated agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-thrombotic-microangiopathy/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H82111\"><span class=\"h1\">DRUGS ASSOCIATED WITH DITMA</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H83404\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview of drugs and criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of drugs have been implicated in causing DITMA (sometimes reported in the literature as drug-induced thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura [TTP] or drug-induced hemolytic uremic syndrome [HUS]). However, we limit associated drugs to those that have evidence for a definite or probable association with DITMA. The evidence for the role of these drugs was evaluated in a systematic review of all published reports describing DITMA, drug-induced TTP, or drug-induced HUS, based on stringent criteria for the level of supporting evidence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-thrombotic-microangiopathy/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. The most common drugs with the strongest evidence for a causal association with DITMA are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F101685\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101685 \">table 1</a>); these are drugs for which at least two cases with definite or probable evidence have been reported. Many additional drugs have been implicated in DITMA.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=gemcitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Gemcitabine</a> is the only drug for which we believe both immune- and toxicity-mediated mechanisms have been documented; however, as with other drugs, many of the case reports for gemcitabine lack evidence sufficient for a probable or definite causal association.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For drugs with an assumed immune-mediated mechanism, probable causal association required exclusion of other causes of TMA (eg, TTP), elimination of the possibility that another drug could be responsible, and occurrence of symptoms within 21 days of daily exposure to a new drug or within 24 hours of exposure to a drug taken occasionally. Definite causal association for an immune mechanism required occurrence of systemic symptoms with previous exposure to the same drug or documentation of drug-dependent antibodies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For drugs with an assumed toxicity-mediated mechanism, probable causal association required exclusion of other causes of TMA and elimination of the possibility that another drug could be responsible. Definite causal association required resolution or improvement of the TMA when the suspected drug was stopped or the dose was reduced. These criteria were less stringent than criteria for an immune mechanism because the clinical course of these reactions can be more variable and there are no available laboratory tests.</p><p/><p>In contrast to the drugs discussed below, evidence is lacking for a role of the thienopyridine antiplatelet agents that block the platelet P2Y<sub>12 </sub>receptor (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ticlopidine-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ticlopidine</a>) in DITMA, despite multiple published reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-thrombotic-microangiopathy/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Patients receiving these agents were also receiving multiple other medications or their TMA recurred without re-exposure to the drug. Our opinion is that the reported occurrence of TMA in patients taking clopidogrel or ticlopidine was incidental, not drug induced.</p><p>For drugs that have not been reported but that have a presentation consistent with an immune-mediated mechanism (eg, abrupt onset, history of previous drug exposure associated with systemic symptoms only appreciated in retrospect), testing for drug-dependent antibodies is important for establishing the diagnosis, for advising the patient whether the drug should be avoided for life, and for reporting of new DITMA associations. A finding of drug-dependent antibodies in a patient with DITMA is considered definite evidence of an association and confirms the diagnosis; however, absence of drug-dependent antibodies does not eliminate the possibility of an association, because some antibodies may not be detected and some may be directed against a drug metabolite rather than the parent compound.</p><p>All published reports of DITMA and the grades of evidence supporting a causal association are listed on the first author's (JNG) website, which is regularly updated (<a href=\"http://www.ouhsc.edu/platelets/DITMA.htm&amp;token=ZiLQ8BkqDz0AL92cCSR+AYrPaP/j2cBcvuhigIEBe4r9n4zSWBd//MDhgfdlroezrwC1JCwUsNIWoeWxLU0oqw==&amp;TOPIC_ID=98720\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">http://www.ouhsc.edu/platelets/DITMA.htm</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3955639\"><span class=\"h2\">Drugs (immune mechanism)</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H590279569\"><span class=\"h3\">Quinine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Quinine</a> is the most common cause of immune-mediated DITMA. In a systematic review of all published reports describing drugs and other substances as a suspected cause of TMA, we found that quinine was responsible for 34 of 104 cases in which there was definite evidence for a causal association (33 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-thrombotic-microangiopathy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Our experience with the Oklahoma Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura-Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (TTP-HUS) Registry found quinine-associated TMA in 19 of 509 patients (4 percent) referred for a possible TMA over a 25-year period and found quinine as the cause of DITMA in 20 of 23 patients (87 percent) for whom a drug could be implicated as having a definite or probable causal association with the TMA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-thrombotic-microangiopathy/abstract/2,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,13</a>]. A 2017 report describing the 19 individuals included in our registry found the following features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-thrombotic-microangiopathy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All were white; 18 (95 percent) were women.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eight (42 percent) had a prior history of quinine-related symptoms (nausea, vomiting, fever, chills, headache, confusion, ataxia).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thirteen (68 percent) could recall the precise timing between <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quinine</a> ingestion and symptom onset (all &le;4 hours).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eighteen (95 percent) were caused by a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quinine</a> tablet; one was caused by quinine in tonic water of a <span class=\"nowrap\">vodka/tonic</span> drink [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-thrombotic-microangiopathy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eighteen (95 percent) had evidence of quinine-dependent antiplatelet (or antineutrophil) antibodies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All had acute kidney injury; 17 of 18 required dialysis; three developed end-stage renal disease; and two underwent renal transplantation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One patient died from complications of central venous catheter insertion. Of the remaining 18, eight died a median of nine years following diagnosis, five from cardiovascular disease or stroke that may have been related to the TMA.</p><p/><p>Exposure to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quinine</a> requires specific questioning because it is often omitted from the routine medical history. Quinine tablets may be borrowed from a friend or family member, or the exposure may occur from a beverage (eg, tonic water, bitter lemon) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F60296\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60296 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-thrombotic-microangiopathy/abstract/4,6,14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6,14,15</a>]. In the United States, the only available quinine tablet (Qualaquin) requires a prescription, and the only approved indication is for malaria treatment. However, some individuals may be using the antimalarial drug for leg cramps despite a Boxed Warning regarding TMA as a potential complication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-thrombotic-microangiopathy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. There are also several over-the-counter tablets and herbal remedies for leg cramps available in the United States that may contain quinine, and quinine tablets can be purchased over-the-counter in Canada and other countries. Quinine may also be added to drugs of abuse such as cocaine.</p><p>Importantly, TMA from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quinine</a> can be triggered either by a single ingestion (eg, one quinine tablet, quinine-containing beverage) occurring many months or years after a previous exposure, up to 10 years in our experience. This is because the drug-dependent antibodies can persist for many years, but they cannot react with target cells in the absence of the drug. Acute immune-mediated tissue damage can occur within hours of re-exposure. It is not known whether the homeopathic doses of quinine present in remedies for leg cramps in the United States can trigger TMA, but in principle, immune-mediated DITMA can occur with extremely low levels of re-exposure.</p><p>Chronic kidney disease appears to be very common following quinine-induced TMA; the mechanism of renal damage is not well understood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-thrombotic-microangiopathy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

Early involvement of the consulting specialist is advised because there is a need to balance the risks and benefits of using or not using these other therapies, both of which have their own associated risks.</p><p>Our avoidance of PEX therapy when there is a high level of confidence in the diagnosis of DITMA is supported by a lack of high-quality evidence for a benefit of PEX in DITMA and is consistent with recommendations from the American Society for Apheresis (ASFA), which publishes an evidence-based categorization of the utility of PEX based on review of available evidence and considers <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quinine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gemcitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gemcitabine</a> to be category IV (ie, PEX ineffective or harmful) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-thrombotic-microangiopathy/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. Of note, the ASFA guideline considers PEX to be effective for ticlopidine-associated TMA; however, we consider these patients to have had acquired, autoimmune TTP rather than DITMA. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=therapeutic-apheresis-plasma-exchange-or-cytapheresis-indications-and-technology#H4201158\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Therapeutic apheresis (plasma exchange or cytapheresis): Indications and technology&quot;, section on 'ASFA therapeutic categories'</a>.)</p><p>There have been reports of patients with toxicity-mediated DITMA attributed to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gemcitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gemcitabine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mitomycin</a>, interferon, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxorubicin-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxorubicin</a>, and other drugs, and case reports have described patients with acute kidney injury attributed to gemcitabine who improved after treatment with anticomplement therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-thrombotic-microangiopathy/abstract/67,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">67,68</a>]. However, these case reports do not provide confidence that anticomplement therapy is appropriate. Often the patients have received multiple chemotherapeutic agents, and the selection of gemcitabine as the possible etiology is arbitrary (eg, based on previous case reports). Often a kidney biopsy to document TMA has not been done. Although these preliminary observations do not provide confidence that anticomplement therapy is appropriate, we do believe it is reasonable to consider the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=eculizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">eculizumab</a> in persistent toxicity-mediated DITMA that does not improve with supportive care and withdrawal of the offending agent. Similarly, we believe it is reasonable to consider eculizumab in patients with acute, severe immune-mediated DITMA who are at risk for the development of chronic kidney disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/drug-induced-thrombotic-microangiopathy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>For patients for whom PEX or anticomplement therapy has already been initiated, we base our decisions regarding continuation or discontinuation of therapy on our level of confidence that the diagnosis is DITMA and the patient's clinical course. As with other TMAs, these decisions can be re-evaluated when additional clinical information becomes available, including the response to therapy, identification of alternative causes of the patient's symptoms, and results of other diagnostic testing. However, it is important to note that improvement during PEX or anticomplement therapy may be coincidental and does not necessarily imply a treatment response. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acquired-ttp-initial-treatment#H407079\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acquired TTP: Initial treatment&quot;, section on 'Continuation and completion of therapy'</a>.)</p><p>Immunosuppressive therapy also is not a component of DITMA management, although it may be appropriate if the diagnosis is unclear (eg, glucocorticoids for patients in whom the diagnosis of TTP is suspected).</p><p>Various levels of supportive care may be needed in the management of patients as they recover from DITMA. It is appropriate to transfuse platelets for severe thrombocytopenia associated with clinically important bleeding (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-and-laboratory-aspects-of-platelet-transfusion-therapy#H558395184\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical and laboratory aspects of platelet transfusion therapy&quot;, section on 'Actively bleeding patient'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-and-laboratory-aspects-of-platelet-transfusion-therapy#H558395714\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical and laboratory aspects of platelet transfusion therapy&quot;, section on 'TTP or HIT'</a>). Indications for dialysis and avoidance of nephrotoxic drugs are similar as with other patients with renal failure.

The importance of future drug avoidance depends on whether the mechanism of DITMA is immune mediated or toxicity mediated.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Immune mediated</strong> &ndash; For immune-mediated DITMA, the implicated agent must be completely avoided for life. Subsequent exposures can result in severe symptoms that may be fatal, even with lower doses or levels of exposure. Strict avoidance of the implicated drug should be noted clearly in the medical record. Patients who have recovered from quinine-induced TMA must be warned that even the low concentrations of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quinine</a> in beverages such as tonic water can cause a recurrent, severe episode.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Importantly, a patient should never be re-exposed to a drug potentially implicated in immune-mediated DITMA solely for the purpose of establishing the role of the drug, as this could be life threatening.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, a patient with immune-mediated DITMA may be able to receive an alternative agent within the same drug class because drug-dependent antibodies may be specific for the individual drug (eg, antibodies that react with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quinine</a> may not react with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quinidine</a>, which is structurally similar). (See <a href=\"#H21437823\" class=\"local\">'Mechanism (immune-mediated)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Toxicity mediated </strong>&ndash; For toxicity-mediated DITMA that appears to be dose related, re-exposure to the implicated drug may be possible in selected cases. The decision must balance the potential risks of recurrent DITMA, which may be negligible with lower doses of the medication, versus the potential benefits of drug administration. As examples, kidney injury with features of TMA may be seen with high serum levels of a calcineurin inhibitor but may not recur with lower doses; in contrast, it may be appropriate to avoid an implicated chemotherapy agent in the palliative setting when other alternatives are available.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Discussions of alternative options for immunosuppression following hematopoietic and solid organ transplantation are presented in detail separately.

Toxicity-mediated DITMA may have multiple mechanisms and is often dose dependent. (See <a href=\"#H10429235\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drugs most commonly associated with DITMA are listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F101685\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101685 \">table 1</a>). The most common cause of immune-mediated DITMA is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quinine</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F60296\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60296 \">table 2</a>). Common causes of toxicity-mediated DITMA include type 1 interferon, some cancer therapies (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gemcitabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gemcitabine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bevacizumab-including-biosimilars-of-bevacizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bevacizumab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sunitinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sunitinib</a>), calcineurin inhibitors (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>), and drugs of abuse (eg, cocaine, intravenous use of extended-release <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxymorphone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxymorphone</a>).

Individuals with quinine-induced DITMA may also have multiple abnormalities not characteristically associated with TMA syndromes, such as fever, chills, hypotension, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), rhabdomyolysis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> abnormal liver function. Drug-dependent antibodies may be identified in individuals with immune-mediated DITMA. ADAMTS13 activity is normal or only mildly decreased in DITMA.

The history should include explicit questioning about exposures to drugs associated with DITMA. It is also important to determine the duration of the exposure and whether use of the drug occurred on a daily basis or intermittently. Laboratory testing in patients with suspected DITMA includes the testing done for all patients with suspected primary TMA, including measurement of ADAMTS13 activity. Patients with suspected immune-mediated DITMA should have testing for drug-dependent antibodies. A finding of drug-dependent antibodies is supportive if positive but not required. Absence of severe ADAMTS13 deficiency is also consistent with DITMA but not diagnostic.
