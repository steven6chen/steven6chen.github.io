Cardiac rehabilitation facilitates education, monitoring, and guidance to reduce iatrogenesis and promote adherence. Further, it fosters cognition, socialization, and independence in older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-in-older-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Cardiac rehabilitation programs are designed to enhance recovery from acute cardiovascular events and to improve both quality of life and survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-in-older-adults/abstract/3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-7</a>]. In addition, patients with stable coronary heart disease treated medically or those who have undergone myocardial revascularization with percutaneous coronary intervention or coronary artery bypass graft surgery derive benefit.

Elderly subjects are at greater risk for the latter problem because of the delayed baroreceptor responsiveness with aging.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The exercise heart rate returns more gradually to resting values in the elderly patient, necessitating a longer period of rest between various components of exercise or for higher-intensity activity when it is alternated with periods of low-intensity exercise.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aging is associated with a decrease in skin blood flow, which lowers the efficiency of sweating and temperature regulation during exercise. This warrants a reduction in the intensity of exercise for elderly patients in hot or humid environments.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1981965\"><span class=\"h2\">Exercise prescription</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aerobic training is initially begun at low intensity, eg, 2 to 3 METs, with a gradual increase in both exercise intensity and duration to limit discomfort and injury. Only mild fatigue should be engendered by an exercise training session. The elderly patient who remains asymptomatic at lower intensities of exercise and who has no contraindications to more strenuous exercise, based on the results of pretraining exercise testing, may be progressed gradually to higher, albeit still moderate, activity intensity.</p><p>Even in previously physically active elderly individuals, musculoskeletal complications can be substantially lessened by avoidance of running, jumping, and other high-impact aerobic activities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-in-older-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Elderly women are more liable to experience musculoskeletal complications of high-impact activities than are elderly men.</p><p>Although the ideal exercise regimen for older adult coronary patients has not yet been determined, the exercise undertaken should be dynamic, enjoyable, easily accessible, and without adverse sequelae. Brisk regular walking is an excellent prototype of a readily accessible form of exercise designed to achieve aerobic fitness; gradual increases are recommended in both the pace and distance of walking. Further advantages are that no special equipment, facilities, exercise skills, or training are required, and walking permits socialization with exercising companions. Brisk walking constitutes a substantial percentage of the lower maximal oxygen uptake of elderly patients and is therefore an effective and safe physical conditioning stimulus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-in-older-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In comparison, brisk walking is usually insufficient to stimulate a training effect in younger individuals, except for those who are extremely sedentary.</p><p>Arm exercise should be added to the walking regimen since training of arm muscles is needed to affect improvement in the exercise response to arm work. Strength training, designed to improve muscle function and increase muscle mass, also enhances aerobic capacity and it is an additional component of value in the exercise rehabilitation of the elderly coronary patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-in-older-adults/abstract/18,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,21</a>].</p><p>One study suggests that frailty, increasingly common in elderly cardiovascular patients referred for cardiac rehabilitation, may influence the onset, type, and intensity of the exercise training program and identified a need for tailored rehabilitative interventions for these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-in-older-adults/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>The American College of Sports Medicine has specific recommendations for physical activity and exercise in older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-in-older-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

The intensity range recommended for exercise training should be 60 to 75 percent of the highest heart rate safely achieved at exercise testing. This exercise intensity is still an effective stimulus for aerobic metabolism and improved endurance, and is associated with greater comfort and enjoyment and fewer musculoskeletal complications than encountered at the previously recommended 70 to 85 percent heart rate range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-in-older-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

The minimal effect of exercise alone on body weight is probably due to the low energy expenditure with exercise achieved in older adults.

In an analysis of Medicare claims for hospitalizations during 1997 in over 250,000 individuals over the age of 65, cardiac rehabilitation use was 13.9 percent in patients hospitalized for acute myocardial infarction and 31.0 percent in those who underwent coronary artery bypass graft surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-in-older-adults/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Similar low referral rates were reported after percutaneous coronary intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-in-older-adults/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Another study found that about 37 percent of elderly patients with recent myocardial infarction were not referred and that about two-thirds who were referred did not attend [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-in-older-adults/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. In a study of 169 elderly patients with heart failure, only 21 percent were referred to any cardiac rehabilitation service [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-in-older-adults/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>], although at interview most wanted to attend. After an acute coronary syndrome hospitalization, patients older and younger than age 65 had comparable and maintained improvements in functional capacity, metabolic profile, and other prognostic parameters due to cardiac rehabilitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-in-older-adults/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p>A 2011 review of cardiac care for older adults highlights that cardiac rehabilitation can be better utilized to reduce morbidity and mortality, to improve quality of life, increase functional capacity, reduce readmissions, and reduce healthcare costs for elderly patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-in-older-adults/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. The multiple comorbidities and complex medication regimens are often specifically addressed within a cardiac rehabilitation setting. Although many older patients are not referred because they are deemed too frail, these are the patients that often achieve the greatest benefits. </p><p>The American Heart Association&rsquo;s Get With the Guidelines Program identified older age and individuals with the most comorbidities as those with decreased odds of referral for cardiac rehabilitation and advocated more emphasis on increasing referral to cardiac rehabilitation to overcome the underutilization of this modality in the secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-in-older-adults/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. </p><p>In a prospective controlled study, an automatic referral strategy, combined with patient discussion, was shown to achieve the highest rates of cardiac rehabilitation referral [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-in-older-adults/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Institutions were encouraged to adopt such quality improvement initiatives to promote the dissemination and implementation of cardiac rehabilitation referral. This is reinforced by the findings that among Medicare beneficiaries, a strong dose-response relationship existed between the number of cardiac rehabilitation sessions attended and long-term outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-in-older-adults/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Attending all 36 sessions was associated with lower risk of death and myocardial infarction at four years.</p><p>The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services track referral to cardiac rehabilitation after hospitalization for myocardial infarction or heart failure, percutaneous coronary intervention, and coronary artery bypass graft surgery as a performance measure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-in-older-adults/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. The success of non-center or hospital-based rehabilitation programs requires application to elderly patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-in-older-adults/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>] such as home-based exercise programs supported by smartphone applications to track relevant data, smartphone-based interactive tools, and computer- or mobile phone-based coaching and motivational strategies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-in-older-adults/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2766330536\"><span class=\"h1\">RECOMMENDATIONS OF OTHERS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Clinical Practice Guideline &quot;Cardiac Rehabilitation,&quot; released by the United States Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR) and cosponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, concluded that cardiac rehabilitation is an essential component of the contemporary management of patients with multiple presentations of coronary heart disease or heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-in-older-adults/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. It also emphasized the added effectiveness of multifactorial cardiac rehabilitation integrated in a comprehensive approach. In the studies reviewed, elderly patients had a high adherence to exercise training, and no complications or adverse outcomes of exercise occurred.</p><p>A specific section of the AHCPR Guideline addressed the application of cardiac rehabilitation to elderly patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-in-older-adults/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. A statistically significant improvement in measures of exercise tolerance has been associated with exercise rehabilitation, with no significant difference between the relative improvement of older and younger patients (or between men and women) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-in-older-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Elderly patients who participated in multifactorial cardiac rehabilitation had a significant reduction in coronary risk factors. Despite these benefits, both referral to and participation in exercise rehabilitation have been less frequent in older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-in-older-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], especially elderly women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-in-older-adults/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. Comparable findings were reported in the French nationwide PREVENIR survey [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-in-older-adults/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]</p><p>The guideline also highlighted that elderly patients were less fit than younger patients following a coronary event, in part due to their lesser fitness prior to the event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-in-older-adults/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. This is evident by the lower peak exercise capacity in elderly patients, both at entry into exercise rehabilitation and at the completion of rehabilitative exercise training. In the studies reviewed, adherence to exercise training in older adults was high, and no complications or adverse outcomes of exercise training in elderly subjects were described in any study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-in-older-adults/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>For all of these reasons, the guideline recommended that elderly patients of both genders should be strongly encouraged to participate in exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation, particularly a multifactorial program. A similar recommendation was made in the 2003 Exercise and Physical Activity Scientific Statement from the American Heart Association [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-in-older-adults/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p>A presidential advisory from the American Heart Association highlights the importance of novel approaches to the delivery of cardiac rehabilitation services to increase the access to cardiac rehabilitative care to underserved populations, including older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-in-older-adults/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p>In 2001 the American Heart Association published a Scientific Statement outlining a risk classification of patients for exercise training and contraindications for exercise testing and training [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-in-older-adults/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].</p><p>A 2002 American Heart Association Scientific Statement made management recommendations for secondary prevention of coronary heart disease in older adults, with emphasis on patients 75 years of age or older [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-rehabilitation-in-older-adults/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. These recommendations included lipid lowering, smoking cessation, treatment of hypertension and diabetes, weight reduction, and exercise, all of which are elements of the multifactorial approach to cardiac rehabilitation.
