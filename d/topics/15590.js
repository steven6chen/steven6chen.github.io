Septic bursitis refers to inflammation of the bursa that is due to infection, typically resulting from bacterial inoculation that is direct (eg, puncture wound), spread from nearby soft tissues (eg, cellulitis), or hematogenous (eg, bacterial endocarditis).</p><p>Nonseptic bursitis due to trauma, repetitive injury, crystal diseases, and other systemic disorders are discussed separately.

Bursae may be divided by location into those that are superficial or deep. Superficial bursae are subcutaneous and separate skin from deeper tissues such as periosteum or ligaments. Deep bursae serve to reduce friction between fibrous structures, such as tendons, from adjacent bone. Bursae are lined by synovial cells, which under ordinary circumstances produce a small amount of lubricating fluid.</p><p>Factors that increase the risk of septic bursitis include loss of skin integrity, impaired response to infection (eg, diabetes mellitus, alcohol abuse), and host factors that lead to an increased amount of bursal fluid or tissue (such as rheumatoid arthritis or tophaceous gout) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-bursitis/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. One study of septic olecranon bursitis found that one-third of patients had at least one comorbid illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-bursitis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. It is unclear whether immunosuppressed states such as <span class=\"nowrap\">HIV/AIDS</span> increase the risk of septic bursitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-bursitis/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Superficial bursae</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The superficial or subcutaneous bursae are predisposed to infection as a result of skin trauma. The most common mechanisms involved in septic superficial bursitis consist of direct inoculation due to puncture of the overlying skin or contiguous spread from cellulitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-bursitis/abstract/2,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6</a>]. The majority of reported cases have been in men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-bursitis/abstract/5,8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8-10</a>]. Trauma to the skin and bursa may be occupational, due to recreational activities, or related to concomitant disease. Among these the following are notable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-bursitis/abstract/6,11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,11-13</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Olecranon septic bursitis &ndash; Due to repetitive trauma in plumbers, carpenters, miners, athletes, patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (possibly the result of leaning on the elbows), and those receiving chronic hemodialysis via vascular access in the arm</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prepatellar or infrapatellar septic bursitis &ndash; In athletes and those with kneeling occupations such as housemaids, carpet layers, clergy, and gardeners</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ischiogluteal septic bursitis &ndash; In weavers and patients with spinal cord injury</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bunions &ndash; A bursa may form over the medial aspect of the first metatarsophalangeal joint in patients with hallux valgus where pressure due to poorly fitting shoes can cause skin breakdown and bursal infection.</p><p/><p>Iatrogenic infection of the olecranon bursa was reported in 3 (12 percent) of 25 patients who received intrabursal <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a> injection to treat traumatic olecranon bursitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-bursitis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. An association between septic bursitis and protease inhibitors treatment of hepatitis C has been noted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-bursitis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Deep bursae</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Direct inoculation of deep bursa is uncommon, but iatrogenic infection resulting from bursal injections of glucocorticoids (eg, subacromial, iliopsoas, or trochanteric bursae) may occur in rare cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-bursitis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. A history of recent joint aspiration and injection should alert the clinician to a possible deep septic bursitis. In the absence of a known inoculation, infection of deep bursae are presumed to be due to hematogenous seeding or spread from an adjacent septic site such as contiguous septic arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-bursitis/abstract/9,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bursitis-an-overview-of-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bursitis: An overview of clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with septic bursitis typically present with pain and peribursal erythema and warmth, often in the setting of diabetes, alcoholism, or immunosuppression. Fever is present in 40 to 44 percent of patients with septic bursitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-bursitis/abstract/3,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,17</a>]. Peribursal warmth, erythema, edema, and tenderness to touch suggest a diagnosis of bursal sepsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-bursitis/abstract/3,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,17,18</a>]. The presence of a puncture wound or abrasion of the skin overlying the involved bursa suggests antecedent trauma. Patients with acute septic bursitis may be more likely to present earlier and have more pain, erythema, warmth, and tenderness than patients with noninfectious bursitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-bursitis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The distinction from noninfectious bursitis may be more difficult in subacute or chronic infection.</p><p>Features distinguishing septic from aseptic bursitis include tenderness (88 percent septic bursitis versus 36 percent aseptic bursitis), <span class=\"nowrap\">erythema/cellulitis</span> (83 percent septic bursitis versus 27 percent aseptic bursitis), warmth (84 percent septic bursitis versus 56 percent aseptic bursitis), report of trauma or evidence of a skin lesion (50 percent septic bursitis versus 25 percent aseptic bursitis), and fever (38 percent septic bursitis versus 0 percent aseptic bursitis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-bursitis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>An infected bursa is often tender to touch, and there is a high frequency of peribursal soft tissue inflammation and of overlying skin lesions. However, peripheral and bursal synovial white blood cell counts may not be elevated and do not differ significantly among patients with septic and aseptic bursitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-bursitis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Thus, these laboratory values cannot be used to distinguish between these conditions; Gram stain and culture of bursal synovial fluid must be performed if septic bursitis is suspected.</p><p>Common sites for septic bursitis are the superficially located olecranon, prepatellar, and infrapatellar bursae. For these superficial bursae, adjacent joint motion may be relatively preserved; in contrast, septic arthritis is associated with marked limitation of joint motion.</p><p>Leukocytosis, neutrophilia, and an increased proportion of immature neutrophils (ie, bandemia) may be noted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-bursitis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein are usually elevated. Bacteremia is relatively rare and is more often a feature of deep than superficial septic bursitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-bursitis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In one series of 71 patients hospitalized with bursitis, blood cultures were positive in 4 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-bursitis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In another series including 62 patients, blood cultures were positive in 19 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-bursitis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> is the causative organism in 80 percent or more of cases of culture-proven septic bursitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-bursitis/abstract/5,6,10,13,19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6,10,13,19-21</a>]. Streptococci of various species are the next most commonly reported cause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-bursitis/abstract/2,6,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6,20</a>]. Less commonly reported organisms causing acute septic bursitis include coagulase-negative staphylococci, <em>Enterococcus</em>, <em>Escherichia coli</em>, <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>, and anaerobes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-bursitis/abstract/6,8,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8,22</a>]. Polymicrobial infections constitute a significant proportion of non&ndash;<em>S. aureus</em> bursitis, ranging from 10 to 36 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-bursitis/abstract/6,8,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8,20</a>].</p><p>Subacute or chronic bursitis may be due to <em>Brucella abortus</em>, Mycobacteria (both <em>M. tuberculosis</em> and atypical mycobacteria, such as <em>M. kansasii</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-bursitis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]), fungi such as <em>Candida</em>, dematiaceous fungi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-bursitis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], molds, and algae including <em>Prototheca </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-bursitis/abstract/13,25-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,25-39</a>]. Systemic infection should be considered in cases of bursitis caused by <em>Brucella</em> or <em>M. tuberculosis</em> in endemic regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-bursitis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of septic bursitis is suggested by the clinical presentation and confirmed by culture of fluid from the affected bursa. Aspiration of fluid is warranted to distinguish septic bursitis from aseptic bursitis. Imaging studies may be useful in some circumstances, as discussed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Bursa aspiration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aspiration of bursal fluid is indicated whenever there is an effusion, and septic bursitis is suspected in the setting of pain, local inflammation, or fever. Bursal fluid may be obtained by bedside needle aspiration in most cases of superficial prepatellar (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F61701\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61701 \">picture 1</a>) and olecranon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F72647\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72647 \">picture 2</a>) bursitis. The techniques for prepatellar and olecranon bursal aspiration are discussed in more detail separately. Aspiration and drainage of deep bursae typically require image-assisted needle <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> catheter placement using ultrasonography or computed tomographic (CT) guidance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-bursitis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-elbow-pain-in-adults#H29\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of elbow pain in adults&quot;, section on 'Olecranon bursa aspiration'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=knee-bursitis#H217809572\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Knee bursitis&quot;, section on 'Prepatellar and superficial infrapatellar bursitis'</a>.)</p><p>Laboratory analysis of bursal fluid consists of determination of the nucleated cell count (white cell count), Gram stain, and culture for bacteria. Fungal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mycobacterial stains and cultures may be appropriate in selected patients (for examples, gardeners at risk for sporotrichosis, fishermen at risk for <em>Mycobacterium marinum</em>, or immunosuppressed patients at risk for atypical infections) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> when regular bacterial culture is negative. Anaerobic infection should be considered when cultures are initially negative but infectious signs and symptoms persist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-bursitis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cell count &ndash; In septic bursitis, the bursal white blood cell (WBC) count often is not very elevated. One study of 13 patients with culture-proven bursitis noted that 8 patients had bursal fluid leukocyte counts less than <span class=\"nowrap\">20,000/mm<sup>3</sup></span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-bursitis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

A summary of the literature on olecranon bursitis found an average bursal WBC of <span class=\"nowrap\">62,923/mm<sup>3</sup></span> (range 900 to <span class=\"nowrap\">392,500/mm<sup>3</sup>),</span> which was significantly elevated compared with the average bursal WBC in aseptic bursitis of <span class=\"nowrap\">2215/mm<sup>3</sup></span> (range 50 to <span class=\"nowrap\">11,700/mm<sup>3</sup>)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-bursitis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Immunocompromised hosts may have a blunted inflammatory response.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gram stain &ndash; The sensitivity of Gram stain for detection of microorganisms ranges from 15 to 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-bursitis/abstract/3,4,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,13</a>]. When an organism is seen, it may be helpful in guiding antibiotic therapy. A positive Gram stain is observed in the setting of olecranon bursitis in half to two-thirds of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-bursitis/abstract/6,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Crystal identification &ndash; Compensated polarized microscopy by an experienced clinician or technician is warranted to assess for the presence of crystals and, if present, to classify them on the basis of their shape and birefringence. The technique is the same as that employed to identify crystals in joint fluid. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=synovial-fluid-analysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Synovial fluid analysis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bursa fluid glucose &ndash; The diagnostic utility of bursal fluid glucose is uncertain. In one report including 30 patients with olecranon or prepatellar bursitis (10 of whom had septic bursitis), the mean bursal fluid glucose concentration was significantly lower in septic than in nonseptic bursal fluids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-bursitis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. A bursa fluid glucose:serum glucose ratio of &lt;50 percent was observed almost exclusively in cases of septic bursitis. However, the bursa fluid glucose concentration also is low in nonseptic bursitis observed in patients with rheumatoid arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-bursitis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, imaging studies are not helpful in the setting of acute superficial (olecranon or prepatellar) bursitis. In the setting of suspected foreign body penetration, imaging with plain film, ultrasonography, or CT may be warranted. In the setting of suspected deep septic bursitis, imaging with CT or magnetic resonance imaging may be warranted to assess for the presence of a bursal effusion, associated abscesses, or affected adjacent structures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-bursitis/abstract/13,40,42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,40,42,43</a>].

Distinguishing cellulitis with and without bursitis depends on skilled palpation. If superficial bursal involvement is suspected, ultrasonography may be warranted; if deep bursal involvement is suspected, computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be warranted. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cellulitis-and-skin-abscess-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cellulitis and skin abscess: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Crystal-induced bursitis &ndash; Periarticular inflammation may occur in patients with tophaceous gout (or, less commonly, pseudogout). A history of prior episodes of crystal-associated inflammation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the finding of crystals in the bursal fluid is suggestive. Concomitant gouty and septic bursitis may occur.

A joint effusion is also suggestive of acute monoarthritis, if present. However, patients with prepatellar or infrapatellar septic bursitis may have concomitant knee effusion. If there is any doubt regarding the presence of a simultaneous acute arthritis, the joint must be aspirated (preferably through clinically uninvolved skin) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-bursitis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The differential diagnosis of acute monoarthritis includes rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, reactive arthritis, and ankylosing spondylitis.

Initial antibiotic selection is guided by common pathogens (most often staphylococcal and streptococcal spp) and by Gram stain results. Daily needle aspiration usually suffices for drainage of superficially located bursae. Surgical or catheter drainage may be needed for complicated septic bursitis at superficial sites and for deep bursal infection. There are no published data to support corticosteroid injection of an infected bursa.</p><p>Indications for hospitalization <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> intravenous antibiotic therapy for septic bursitis include the presence of fulminant local infection, evidence for systemic toxicity, or infection in an immunocompromised patient.</p><p>Prophylaxis against tetanus may be indicated in cases of bursitis due to tetanus-prone trauma.

These data suggest that a higher prevalence of community-acquired MRSA should be expected in septic bursitis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunosuppressed host &ndash; Immunosuppressed patients should be treated with broad-spectrum coverage that includes both anti-MRSA and anti-pseudomonal coverage while awaiting culture data. An immunosuppressed patient may require a longer duration of antibiotic treatment than an otherwise healthy host [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-bursitis/abstract/9,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,48</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Duration of therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The duration of antibiotic therapy should be determined by the clinical response, culture results, and general health of the host. Many cases are treated for two to three weeks. One prospective study including 25 patients demonstrated that the length of time necessary to achieve sterility with antibiotic therapy (an average of four days) correlated with the duration of symptoms prior to diagnosis (ie, longer duration of symptoms was associated with delayed response) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-bursitis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. When antibiotic therapy was continued for five additional days after documented culture sterility, all patients in the trial were cured (average follow-up duration six months).</p><p>In a subsequent retrospective study including 343 episodes of severe infectious bursitis (237 olecranon and 106 patellar) requiring inpatient care and bursectomy, <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> was the predominant organism among the 256 cases with an identifiable pathogen (85 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-bursitis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Surgery was performed in 312 cases (91 percent); 142 patients underwent one-stage bursectomy with immediate closure, and 146 patients underwent two-stage bursectomy, with closure delayed until after two to four days of antibiotic treatment. All received antibiotics for a median duration of 13 days (median duration of intravenous antibiotics was 3 days); cure was achieved in 85 percent of cases. There was no association between cure and the total duration of antibiotic therapy. Therefore, the authors conclude that adjuvant antibiotic therapy might be limited to seven days in nonimmunosuppressed patients, though patients who do not undergo early drainage may need longer courses of antibiotics. In patients with MSSA bursitis, a trial of intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cloxacillin-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cloxacillin</a> (for approximately 7 days) followed by oral cloxacillin (for approximately 12 days) demonstrated complete resolution in 96 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-bursitis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>], suggesting oral antibiotics in addition to a shorter course of intravenous may be sufficient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Drainage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical experience suggests that treating septic bursitis with antibiotics alone is often inadequate. Adequate drainage can usually be achieved without surgical intervention.</p><p>Superficial bursae can often be drained with daily needle aspiration. Patients who fail to respond to intravenous antibiotics and percutaneous aspiration of the bursa may require surgical drainage or bursectomy.</p><p>Deep bursae are more difficult to drain by repeated needle aspiration. For these sites, surgery or imaging-guided indwelling catheter placement are alternative approaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-bursitis/abstract/40,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,43</a>].</p><p>Repeated aspirations should be performed until the bursal fluid is sterile or no longer accumulates. An indwelling catheter may be withdrawn once the quantity of drainage has significantly decreased and only a small amount (eg, &lt;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/day)</span> or no drainage is noted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications for surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Indications for surgical intervention for acute septic bursitis include inability to drain the bursa adequately via needle aspiration or catheter placement, presence of a foreign body, or adjacent skin or soft tissue infection requiring debridement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-bursitis/abstract/6,13,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,13,51</a>]. Surgical excision of an infected bursa may also be indicated in immunocompromised or critically ill patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-bursitis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p>Typically, bursectomy is performed as a one-stage procedure with immediate closure when the wound is grossly clean. Otherwise, a two-stage bursectomy may be performed, delaying closure until after two to four days of antibiotic treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-bursitis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In one trial including 164 patients with septic bursitis (130 with olecranon bursitis and 34 with prepatellar bursitis) randomized to receive one-stage or two-stage bursectomy (together with one week of antibiotic therapy), treatment failure occurred less commonly among those who underwent one-stage bursectomy than two-stage bursectomy (10 versus 16 percent); rates of recurrent infection were similar (3 to 4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-bursitis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p>A retrospective study of adult patients with 343 cases of infectious olecranon and patellar bursitis who underwent early drainage noted that the duration of antibiotic therapy could be shortened; patients who do not undergo early drainage may need longer courses of antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-bursitis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Open debridement can be complicated by skin necrosis and wound breakdown, in addition to scar sensitivity and a prolonged recovery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-bursitis/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. In one series of eight patients who underwent endoscopic bursectomy for the treatment of septic pre-patellar bursitis, no recurrences, reports of tenderness or hypoesthesia around the wound, wound complications, or skin necrosis were observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-bursitis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. A review of 29 published studies that included 1278 patients with olecranon bursitis suggested that, compared with open or endoscopic bursectomy, nonsurgical management might yield significantly higher rates of clinical resolution and fewer overall complications, such as persistent drainage and bursal infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-bursitis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Recurrent infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If septic bursitis recurs following discontinuation of antibiotic treatment, another more prolonged course of antibiotics is generally tried before resorting to surgery. If not treated adequately, septic bursitis can result in chronic bursal infection; potential complications include osteomyelitis or cutaneous fistula formation. Following the first relapse, if there is subsequent recurrence of infection or persistence of a thick bursal synovium, consideration should be given to total bursal excision during a quiescent phase of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/septic-bursitis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Etiology and pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Typical presenting features of superficial septic bursitis include pain, erythema, warmth, and an effusion. Restricted joint motion may indicate septic deep bursitis, with or without associated septic arthritis. Fever, peripheral blood leukocytosis, neutrophilia, and a shift to immature forms may be noted. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> is the causative organism in more than 80 percent of cases. Streptococci of various species are the next most commonly reported cause. Less commonly reported organisms causing acute septic bursitis include coagulase-negative staphylococci, <em>Enterococcus</em>, <em>Escherichia coli</em>, <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>, and anaerobes. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of septic bursitis is suggested by the clinical presentation and confirmed by culture of fluid from the affected bursa. Aspirated fluid should be sent for Gram stain, culture, cell count, and crystal analysis. The range of bursal fluid nucleated cell counts &gt;2000 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/mm<sup>3</sup></span> are often found in septic bursal fluid. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Bursa aspiration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the setting of suspected deep septic bursitis, imaging with ultrasonography, magnetic resonance imaging, or computed tomography (CT) scanning is warranted. Ultrasonography or CT scanning may be used to guide aspiration of deep bursae. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Imaging studies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment of septic bursitis requires antibiotic therapy and drainage of infected bursal fluid.
