The most common cause of HUS is due to Shiga toxin-producing <em>Escherichia coli</em> (STEC), and it is one of the main causes of acute kidney injury in children under the age of three years.</p><p>The treatment and prognosis of STEC-HUS is reviewed here. The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of STEC-HUS are discussed separately.

The former, also referred to as typical HUS, primarily resulted from STEC infections, and less frequently from <em>Shigella dysenteriae</em> type 1 infection. All other causes of HUS were referred to as atypical HUS or assigned to the diarrhea-negative HUS, even though some patients with non-STEC-associated HUS also presented with diarrhea.</p><p>However, the following classification is used based on a better understanding of the various causes of HUS (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hemolytic-uremic-syndrome-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hemolytic uremic syndrome in children&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary causes without coexisting disease; such as cases due to complement dysregulation (also referred to as atypical HUS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-shiga-toxin-producing-escherichia-coli-stec-hemolytic-uremic-syndrome-hus-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Complement gene mutations</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Antibodies to complement factor H</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Secondary causes:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Infection:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>STEC</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span><em>Streptococcus pneumoniae</em></p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Drug toxicity, particularly in patients with cancer or solid organ transplant recipients</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Rare occurrences in pregnant patients or in those with autoimmune disorders (eg, systemic lupus erythematous)</p><p/><p>However, subsequent research has already demonstrated limitations of this schema with the identification of other genetic causes of atypical HUS, such as mutations in <em>DGKE</em>, which encodes the protein diacylglycerol kinase epsilon.</p><p>In addition, studies on interventions in patients with STEC-HUS may have used the earlier nomenclature of diarrhea-positive or negative HUS, or typical versus atypical HUS. For this topic, patients identified as either having typical or diarrhea-positive HUS would be diagnosed with secondary HUS due to STEC. In addition, verotoxin, an alternate term for Shiga toxin, also has been used extensively in the literature.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given that STEC-HUS is strongly associated with certain strains of enterohemorrhagic <em>E. coli</em> (EHEC), which produce a Shiga toxin such as type O157:H7, prevention of STEC-HUS rests in part upon measures aimed at reducing the risk of EHEC infection. These preventive measures, including public health measures, are discussed in detail elsewhere in the program. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=microbiology-pathogenesis-epidemiology-and-prevention-of-enterohemorrhagic-escherichia-coli-ehec#H4451407\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Microbiology, pathogenesis, epidemiology, and prevention of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC)&quot;, section on 'Prevention'</a>.)</p><p>Once a patient is infected with EHEC, attempts to prevent progression from the bloody diarrheal phase (acute infectious phase) to the postdiarrheal phase of HUS have been largely unsuccessful (eg, antimotility drugs and antibiotics).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3942307033\"><span class=\"h2\">Hydration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It has been postulated that renal hypoperfusion during the STEC infection phase increases the risk of HUS and that volume expansion before HUS evolves may diminish its occurrence or severity. A systematic review of the literature, which included both randomized trials and observational studies, provided the following observations as evidence supporting the benefit of vigorous fluid repletion during the diarrheal phase of STEC infection to prevent or reduce the severity of HUS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-shiga-toxin-producing-escherichia-coli-stec-hemolytic-uremic-syndrome-hus-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A hematocrit value &gt;23 percent at presentation, used as a measure of inadequate hydration status, was associated with the development of oligoanuric HUS (odds ratio [OR] 2.38, 95% CI 1.30-4.35), renal replacement therapy (OR 1.90, 95% CI 1.25-2.90), and death (OR 5.13, 95% CI, 1.50-17.57).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mortality was increased for clinically dehydrated patients compared with hydrated patients (OR 3.71, 95% CI 1.25-11.03).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Administration of intravenous fluids up to the day of HUS diagnosis was associated with a decreased risk of renal replacement therapy (OR 0.26, 95% CI, 0.11-0.60).</p><p/><p>Although these data suggest an association between volume depletion and adverse outcomes related to STEC-HUS, no studies directly evaluated the effect of hydration during STEC infections on the risk of developing HUS. Nevertheless, these limited data suggest that early parenteral volume expansion with isotonic IV solutions during STEC infections for patients who are volume depleted is associated with attenuated acute kidney injury (AKI). Further research is needed to unequivocally determine whether volume expansion can reduce the risk of HUS or its severity. In addition, there is evidence that suggests a need to maintain adequate hydration during the acute phase of HUS, which is discussed below.

Based upon clinical experience, packed red blood cells (RBC) should be transfused when the hemoglobin (Hgb) level is &lt;6 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> or hematocrit &lt;18 percent to avoid cardiovascular and pulmonary compromise. Approximately 80 percent of children with STEC-HUS require RBC transfusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-shiga-toxin-producing-escherichia-coli-stec-hemolytic-uremic-syndrome-hus-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

In our practice, we typically administer packed red blood cells at a total volume of 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> over three to four hours, which typically raises the Hgb level by 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span>. Transfusions should be stopped if the vital signs suggest cardiopulmonary vascular overload (eg, hypertension, tachycardia, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> tachypnea). In addition, serum or plasma potassium should be closely monitored due to the risk of hyperkalemia for patients with acute renal injury. Blood products should be volume-reduced and preferably depleted of leukocytes and platelets to avoid alloimmunization (thus reducing the risk of graft rejection in patients who may subsequently require renal transplantation). If the patient is undergoing hemodialysis, transfusions should be given during dialysis to minimize the risks of hypervolemia and hyperkalemia.

However, platelet transfusion may induce anti-human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibodies, which may be deleterious later if the patient progresses to end-stage renal failure and undergoes kidney transplantation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Fluid and electrolyte management</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Fluid management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The standard fluid management of patients with HUS has been based on careful assessment since competing processes can lead to either decreased or increased intravascular volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-shiga-toxin-producing-escherichia-coli-stec-hemolytic-uremic-syndrome-hus-in-children/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Decreased volume may result from vomiting, decreased oral intake, or diarrhea, while increased intravascular volume may arise from oliguria or anuria. As a result, fluid management has been based upon the intravascular fluid status of the patient and renal function. Patients with decreased intravascular volume are repleted to a euvolemic state, whereas those with increased intravascular volume and diminished urine output are fluid restricted. Patients with increased intravascular volume may require dialysis treatment to remove fluid, especially if there is cardiac and pulmonary compromise. Once the patient is in a euvolemic state, administration of fluids should be given as insensible losses plus urine output until renal function returns to normal.</p><p>However, a prospective Italian study from 2012 and 2014 demonstrated that early volume expansion targeted to increase body weight by 10 percent improved outcome for 38 children with STEC-HUS compared to historical controls from 2006 to 2009 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-and-prognosis-of-shiga-toxin-producing-escherichia-coli-stec-hemolytic-uremic-syndrome-hus-in-children/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In this study, intravenous (IV) fluid infusion resulting in a mean increase in body weight of 12.5 percent after 48 hours of hospitalization was associated with a lower rate of renal replacement therapy (26 versus 58 percent), shorter hospital course (9 versus 12 days), and shorter duration of intensive care (2 versus 9 days). There was a trend for a lower risk of central nervous system involvement with early volume expansion (8 versus 24 percent), although this was not statistically significant. In the volume expansion group, there were no serious adverse effects. One patient had evidence of fluid overload (eg, hypertension) that responded to diuretic (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">furosemide</a>) therapy. Although these results are encouraging, it should be noted that there is a concern for potential bias with the use of historical controls with potential difference in severity of disease and treatment, and the relatively small number of patients (especially in regards to adverse effects). Nevertheless, these findings should prompt further investigations to confirm the potential benefit of early volume expansion in all children with STEC-HUS.</p><p>Based on these results, we agree that fluid management should be directed to rapidly correct any evidence of volume depletion, which is most likely the more common fluid state of patients with STEC-HUS. However, until further evidence is provided, we do not recommend routine volume expansion without proper assessment of intravascular volume status and renal function, especially if there is evidence of increased intravascular volume. Frequent monitoring of fluid balance, weight, and vital signs remains imperative throughout the course of the acute process. At the first sign of hypertension or cardiopulmonary overload, fluids should be restricted. Diuretics rarely avert anuria, but a trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">furosemide</a> (2 to 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per dose) may be attempted to induce a diuresis, particularly in patients with cardiopulmonary overload. Diuretics should not be continued in the patient who fails to respond. Dialysis therapy is required if fluid restriction <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diuretic therapy fail to improve the compromised cardiorespiratory status of the patient in a timely manner.
