The rationale for these approaches is that an adult population with a lower burden of atherosclerosis, as a result of pediatric preventive care, will have a lower rate of CVD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-prevention-of-adult-cardiovascular-disease-promoting-a-healthy-lifestyle-and-identifying-at-risk-children/abstract/1,3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,4</a>].</p><p>In the 2011 National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) guidelines, specific measures for preventing atherosclerosis were reviewed and graded based on the available literature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-prevention-of-adult-cardiovascular-disease-promoting-a-healthy-lifestyle-and-identifying-at-risk-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].
