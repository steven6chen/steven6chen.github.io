Transfusion of red blood cells (RBCs) can be life-saving in these settings.</p><p>However, transfusion carries risks, many of which are greater in individuals with SCD than in the general population.

In either HbSS or compound heterozygotes, the majority of Hgb is sickle Hgb (HgbS; ie, &gt;50 percent). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-sickle-cell-disorders#H5101867\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of sickle cell disorders&quot;, section on 'Terminology'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Transfusion</strong> &ndash; Simple transfusion refers to transfusion of RBCs without removal of the patient's blood. Exchange transfusion involves transfusion of RBCs together with removal of the patient's blood. Exchange transfusion can be performed manually or via apheresis (also called cytapheresis or hemapheresis) using an extracorporeal continuous flow device.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13340695\"><span class=\"h1\">RATIONALE FOR TRANSFUSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blood transfusion therapy in SCD can serve two roles, either for therapy (typically for life-threatening SCD related complication) or for prophylaxis, to decrease the incidence of specific SCD related complications. In both cases, blood transfusion does more than simply raise the hemoglobin (Hgb) level for oxygen delivery; transfusion also lowers the percentage of sickle Hgb (HgbS) and increases Hgb oxygen saturation, both of which decrease the propensity for vaso-occlusion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanisms-of-vaso-occlusion-in-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanisms of vaso-occlusion in sickle cell disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>At least four mechanisms contribute to the benefit of blood transfusion therapy in treating vaso-occlusive events and decreasing the incidence of SCD-related complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dilution of HgbS-containing RBCs via the addition of HgbA-containing cells from the blood of normal donors</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suppression of erythropoietin release caused by the rise in Hgb, thereby reducing the production of new HgbS-containing cells</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decrease in percentage of HgbS-containing cells due to the longer circulating lifespan of HgbA-containing cells</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increase in Hgb oxygen saturation levels by approximately 1 to 6 percent, which increases oxygen delivery to the tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]</p><p/><p>These mechanisms, together with findings from trials in various clinical settings, inform our recommendations regarding when to transfuse individuals with SCD.

In contrast, simple blood transfusion given at the time of an uncomplicated vaso-occlusive pain episode (eg, to raise the Hgb level to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span> has not been demonstrated to hasten recovery, despite the chronic baseline anemia seen in SCD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H698984\"><span class=\"h2\">Increasing oxygenation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the preoperative setting, simple blood transfusion with a goal Hgb of approximately 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> is associated with a decreased incidence of postoperative vaso-occlusive events. In either a simple or exchange transfusion, the hemoglobin S level is not required to be assessed only because the goal is to successfully raise the hemoglobin to approximately 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL,</span> or if already above 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL,</span> to provide some normal hemoglobin. However, simple blood transfusion to increase the hemoglobin level has not been demonstrated to hasten recovery in the setting of uncomplicated vaso-occlusive events.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9587051\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR TRANSFUSION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9587127\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview of indications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We use red cell transfusion in clinical scenarios where there is strong or compelling evidence of the benefit of reduced morbidity (eg, stroke prevention, reduction of acute chest syndrome and pain events).</p><p>The largest <strong>misuse</strong> of blood transfusion therapy is simple transfusion in an adult or child with SCD admitted to the hospital for an uncomplicated vaso-occlusive pain episode without symptomatic anemia. In such a situation, there is no evidence that simple transfusion therapy will abate the pain episode, and there is a finite risk of transfusion-related complications.</p><p>However, for more complex cases, in which pain occurs in the setting of severe or symptomatic anemia, transfusion may be appropriate. In such cases, it is important to note that blood transfusion should not be used as a substitute for acute and chronic pain management, and pain management should not be delayed while awaiting blood transfusion or an evaluation for the cause of anemia.

This indicates decreased red cell production, most commonly associated with parvovirus B19 infection, but it can occur with any infection.

(See <a href=\"#H8398540\" class=\"local\">'Prophylactic preoperative transfusion'</a> below and <a href=\"#H8399115\" class=\"local\">'Prophylactic (regularly scheduled) transfusion'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>The potential benefit of transfusion therapy must be weighed against potential risks, including transfusion reactions, blood-borne viral infection, iron overload, and alloimmunization. (See <a href=\"#H13341330\" class=\"local\">'Complications of RBC transfusion'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9587206\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptomatic or severe anemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SCD is characterized by chronic, compensated hemolytic anemia. Typically, symptoms of acute anemia develop when this compensation is impaired (eg, from bone marrow aplasia) or when the demand for RBC increases (eg, from splenic sequestration, bleeding, or accelerated hemolysis). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease#H1337425321\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical manifestations of sickle cell disease&quot;, section on 'Anemia'</a>.)</p><p>As discussed below, the possibility of a delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction (DHTR) should also be evaluated; in some individuals with SCD who have a DHTR, the direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test may be only weakly positive or nonspecific. (See <a href=\"#H9588447\" class=\"local\">'Alloimmunization and delayed hemolytic reactions'</a> below.)</p><p>Given that symptomatic anemia will always be superimposed on chronic anemia, the baseline Hgb level and reticulocyte count are critical information in determining whether the symptoms are caused by a drop in the Hgb level and thus whether transfusion is needed. When evaluating reductions in Hgb levels below an individual's baseline, it is also important to distinguish between normal, day-to-day variability of biological anemia and a clinically significant change.</p><p>In general, we suggest simple transfusion for children and adults if the Hgb level is below the patient's baseline and there are new signs or symptoms of anemia, or if there is a progressive trend for a decreasing Hgb over several days without a compensatory increase in reticulocyte count. Symptoms may include tachycardia, postural hypotension, dizziness, mental status change, dyspnea, or congestive heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The potential consequences of severe anemia in children with SCD are illustrated by reports of cerebral ischemia on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Although high-quality data are lacking for absolute thresholds, based on our clinical experience we transfuse all children with a Hgb &lt;5.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> and all adults with a Hgb &lt;6 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL,</span> unless there are major extenuating circumstances. (See <a href=\"#H13340862\" class=\"local\">'Simple versus exchange transfusion'</a> below.)</p><p>Additional information regarding Hgb thresholds used for simple transfusion in children and adults with severe anemia (without SCD) is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-infants-and-children-indications#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell transfusion in infants and children: Indications&quot;, section on 'Indications'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indications-and-hemoglobin-thresholds-for-red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-the-adult#H430736130\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Indications and hemoglobin thresholds for red blood cell transfusion in the adult&quot;, section on 'Overview of our approach'</a>.)</p><p>We transfuse two units of RBCs for adults, and a volume based on weight for children. (See <a href=\"#H13340966\" class=\"local\">'Blood transfusion volumes'</a> below.)</p><p>Many individuals with SCD receiving blood transfusion therapy for acute management of their disease may also be receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyurea</a>. In this situation, no adjustment needs to be made other than to determine whether the requirement for blood transfusion therapy is secondary to reticulocytopenia associated with hydroxyurea therapy.</p><p>The following common causes of acute anemia in individuals with SCD can be distinguished based on clinical assessment at the bedside. However, with the exception of delayed or hyper-acute hemolytic transfusion reactions, simple transfusion is likely to be appropriate therapy, and transfusion should not be withheld while the cause of the anemia is being determined.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Red cell aplasia</strong> &ndash; Parvovirus B19 infection is common in individuals with SCD and can lead to bone marrow aplasia characterized by worsening anemia without a compensatory increase in reticulocyte count. Parvovirus infection may be associated with a number of comorbidities, including and not limited to vaso-occlusive pain or acute chest syndrome (ACS), splenic sequestration, asymptomatic thrombocytopenia, and acute kidney disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. Although the aplasia is transient, the Hgb can become dangerously low, and transfusion is required until the infection is cleared (typically a few days to weeks).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Individuals with decreases in both the Hgb and reticulocyte count should be considered to have a parvovirus infection until proven otherwise. Once a diagnosis of parvovirus has been confirmed, repeat infection does not occur. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-parvovirus-b19-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of parvovirus B19 infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-parvovirus-b19-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of parvovirus B19 infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Splenic or hepatic sequestration </strong>&ndash; An acute sequestration episode can occur when a large portion of the patient's blood volume pools in an organ (eg, spleen, liver, lung), acutely lowering the Hgb level and potentially causing hypovolemic shock. The diagnosis and management of this complication is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-and-prognosis-of-sickle-cell-disease#H757684\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management and prognosis of sickle cell disease&quot;, section on 'Splenic and hepatic sequestration'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatic-manifestations-of-sickle-cell-disease#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatic manifestations of sickle cell disease&quot;, section on 'Hepatic sequestration crisis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acute bleeding</strong> &ndash; Acute bleeding is often associated with surgery. An acute drop in Hgb in an individual with SCD should prompt an evaluation for bleeding as it would in any individual without SCD. Postoperatively, acute bleeding with concomitant increases in respiratory rate and pulse must be differentiated from acute postoperative or SCD-related pain, as the former requires acute surgical management and the latter requires better pain management. In general, a rapid rise in the pulse is more likely to be associated with blood loss than SCD-related pain, and bleeding should be excluded in the setting of rapid increase in pulse, especially postoperatively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If an individual with SCD is severely anemic and hypovolemic, RBC transfusion can be used if performed promptly (eg, within minutes); however, volume replacement should not be delayed while awaiting transfusion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-and-prognosis-of-sickle-cell-disease#H758521\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management and prognosis of sickle cell disease&quot;, section on 'Hydration'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Accelerated hemolysis</strong> &ndash; Accelerated hemolysis in individuals with SCD is often due to a delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction, which should be suspected under the following conditions (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemolytic-transfusion-reactions#H354791\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemolytic transfusion reactions&quot;, section on 'Delayed hemolytic reactions'</a>):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Lower Hgb level after transfusion than before transfusion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Relative anemia noted at least five days after the transfusion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Anemia accompanied by associated vaso-occlusive pain or ACS</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Anemia accompanied by increased bilirubin, LDH, and hemoglobinuria (ie, urine dipstick testing identifies the presence of heme, but microscopic evaluation does not show RBCs)</p><p/><p>Management of individuals with suspected delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction can involve observation if the anemia is not severe and the reticulocyte count is appropriately elevated. However, some individuals may require transfusion for severe or symptomatic anemia. If transfusion is needed, avoidance of the implicated RBC antigen that caused the transfusion reaction is critical; this requires coordination with the transfusion facility responsible for the most recent transfusion, and previous facilities that have provided blood to the individual. Of note, this communication between blood banks is critical because not all individuals with delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions will have the offending alloantibody detected.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H213262\"><span class=\"h2\">Multiorgan failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Multiorgan failure is an incompletely understood complication typically seen in the setting of severe acute painful episodes of SCD. We recommend exchange transfusion in patients with multiorgan failure, based on data from case reports that suggest improved clinical outcomes in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].

The approaches to primary stroke prevention (eg, screening by transcranial Doppler and prophylactic regularly scheduled transfusion for those with abnormal flow velocity) and secondary stroke prevention (eg, chronic exchange transfusion, with a goal of reducing the maximum fraction of HgbS to &lt;30 percent of total Hgb and maintaining the total Hgb &gt;9 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span> are discussed in detail separately.

The severity and rate of clinical decline in pulmonary function, and the corresponding increased need for respiratory support, determines the need for simple versus exchange transfusion. In general, exchange transfusion rather than simple transfusion is required for those with more severe decline in respiratory function (eg, rapid increase in oxygen requirement or work of breathing over the course of hours [not days], along with abnormalities on chest radiography and declining oxygen saturation).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In the event that the facility does not have the capacity for exchange transfusion (red blood cell apheresis or manual exchange), consideration should be made for transferring the patient to a facility that does have this capacity, because decisions to perform exchange transfusion are often time-sensitive and may result in a dramatic improvement in the patient's clinical course.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Details of the indications and parameters used for transfusion in treating ACS are discussed separately.

Short-term therapy (eg, less than six months) is often used during high-risk periods, such as winter months, with increased frequency of respiratory illness, or during transition to hydroxyurea therapy.

Transfusion therapy has many more adverse consequences than hydroxyurea. However, transfusion may be appropriate in some patients based on other important factors such as severity of disease complications, urgency of beneficial effects of the intervention, and individual patient comorbid problems. The benefits of transfusion therapy occur rapidly, especially in patients receiving RBC exchange. In contrast, hydroxyurea requires dose titration and may take months to reach a response. Therefore, the decision to switch from hydroxyurea to transfusion therapy requires an adequate period of drug trial during which there has been lack of improvement or progression of the primary complication being monitored. The threshold to switch therapy requires clinical judgment; high quality data and evidence-based guidelines to guide this decision are lacking. Data to support concomitant use of transfusion therapy and hydroxyurea are very limited, and we do not use these therapies concomitantly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4294324\"><span class=\"h2\">Technical aspects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When performing regularly scheduled transfusions to reduce complications of SCD, our preference is to use exchange transfusion therapy (either automated apheresis or manual exchange) rather than simple blood transfusion, to limit iron accumulation from transfusions. (See <a href=\"#H13340862\" class=\"local\">'Simple versus exchange transfusion'</a> below.)</p><p>For most patients, the goal of regularly scheduled transfusions is to maintain the percent HgbS &lt;30 percent of total Hgb, and the total Hgb &gt;9 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span>. We typically monitor the Hgb level, the percent HgbS, serum ferritin, and reticulocyte count with every blood transfusion to define trends and determine when the next transfusion should occur.</p><p>Decisions regarding discontinuation of a regular transfusion program depend on the reason for the therapy. We continue regularly scheduled transfusion indefinitely when it is used for primary or secondary stroke prevention. In contrast, for individuals who have been placed on regular blood transfusion to abate a high frequency of vaso-occlusive pain or ACS events, we may consider therapy for 6 to 24 months depending on the actual benefit to the patient.</p><p>Regardless of the indication for regularly scheduled blood transfusion therapy, the associated management issues (eg, minor antigen matching, leukoreduction, monitoring of iron burden) should be incorporated into a patient care plan to ensure that designated providers review the results and make decisions on an ongoing basis. Likewise, other components of a comprehensive care plan (eg, assessing symptoms of stroke or pain) can be incorporated into the patient encounters during visits for regularly scheduled transfusions.

In addition to avoiding unnecessary transfusions, we employ evidence-based strategies to minimize transfusion complications, including matching for minor RBC antigens (C, E, and Kell) to reduce the risk of alloimmunization; using a white blood cell filter to decrease the rate of febrile non-hemolytic transfusion reactions; and chelation therapy if iron stores reach a select threshold. (See <a href=\"#H13340708\" class=\"local\">'Minor RBC antigen matching'</a> below and <a href=\"#H1837255\" class=\"local\">'Leukoreduction'</a> below and <a href=\"#H105104\" class=\"local\">'Excessive iron stores'</a> below.)</p><p>Individuals with SCD should not receive blood transfusion therapy from individuals with sickle cell <strong>trait</strong><em> </em>as a component of a regular transfusion therapy program. The receipt of blood from individuals with sickle cell trait is of no consequence for those without SCD, but for those with SCD, receipt of sickle cell trait blood is problematic because sickle hemoglobin (HgbS) in blood from individuals with sickle cell trait will make it difficult for the physician to predict the anticipated HgbS level after the transfusion. While we routinely screen for and use sickle cell trait negative blood for individuals receiving regular blood transfusion therapy, obtaining sickle cell trait-negative blood should not delay transfusion in the setting of acute anemia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13340708\"><span class=\"h2\">Minor RBC antigen matching</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We use minor RBC antigen matching (eg, for C, E, and Kell) to minimize the likelihood of alloimmunization (ie, immunization of the patient by donor RBC antigens), which can occur after a single transfusion. Alloimmunization due to minor RBC antigen mismatch is of greater concern in individuals with SCD than in the general population because individuals with SCD may require ongoing transfusions throughout their lifetimes. Alloimmunization occurs rapidly after the initiation of transfusions without extended matching. Therefore, extended matching should be initiated at the onset of a transfusion program [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Alloimmunization to minor RBC antigens in those with SCD can be associated with vaso-occlusive episodes and life-threatening hemolysis. Equally important, alloimmunization can result in a greater risk of future transfusion reactions and greater difficulty identifying compatible units of blood, thus delaying the only therapy for many life-threatening conditions in SCD. (See <a href=\"#H9588447\" class=\"local\">'Alloimmunization and delayed hemolytic reactions'</a> below.)</p><p>Individuals with SCD are more likely to be from ethnic minority groups in the United States, and the vast majority of donors are from ethnic groups that have a low incidence of SCD. The ethnic mismatch between donor and recipients increases the likelihood of alloimmunization because the frequency of minor RBC antigens is heavily influenced by ethnic origin. Thus, we perform extended crossmatching of RBC units for minor antigens, as do most hematologists who provide lifelong care to individuals with SCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/27-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-34</a>].</p><p>The most common minor RBC match is for C, E, and Kell antigens, regardless of patient age. Some blood banks also match RBC units for individuals with SCD for additional minor antigens, such as Duffy, Kidd, and S. In practice, matching for C, E, and Kell increases the likelihood that the unit will also be compatible for Duffy and Kidd because these antigens are highly related to the patient's race.

Alloimmunization was detected in seven patients, a rate of 0.1 percent.</p><p/><p>To improve the yield of minor RBC antigen matching for individuals with SCD receiving regular blood transfusion, some programs use directed donors to decrease donor exposures. The use of directed donation from minority populations similar to the recipient with SCD has not been shown to offer any advantage for reducing alloimmunization beyond matching minor RBC antigens alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

However, the CVC-associated risks of infection and thrombosis are particularly concerning in individuals with SCD, who are already at increased risk for thrombosis and bacteremia due to their underlying disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/52-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-55</a>].</p><p>CVC-related thromboembolism occurs in up to 30 percent of individuals with SCD who have a CVC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]; this may present as acute chest syndrome or other sickle-related events (eg, vaso-occlusive pain episodes).

Over the 10-year period, central venous access bacteremia accounted for 23 percent of all cases of bacteremia. Additional details of CVC complications are presented separately.

Apheresis can be performed with single-lumen catheter, but this requires an additional form of peripheral venous access, which is not ideal. Thus, our approach in patients undergoing apheresis for exchange transfusion is to utilize double lumen catheters that allow the apheresis equipment to withdraw from the lumen without collapsing the line (eg, double-lumen apheresis port, Vortex port). These stiff ports accommodate high-flow states required for apheresis, and can also be accessed with standard needles for IV fluids and pain management.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In general, complications appear lower with continuous flow apheresis equipment, but intermittent flow devices can be used for apheresis in selected cases and when a continuous flow device is unavailable.

Simple blood transfusions may provide sufficient increase in hemoglobin (Hgb) to increase the oxygen carrying capacity in the setting of severe anemia. In individuals with severe anemia (ie, Hgb &lt;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL),</span> simple transfusion may also be effective in lowering the HgbS level without increasing the red cell viscosity.</p><p>We use simple blood transfusion therapy for the following situations in individuals with SCD:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An uncomplicated drop in Hgb levels resulting in signs or symptoms of decreased oxygen delivery (eg, tachycardia, hypotension, mild respiratory distress), where the immediate need is to restore oxygen carrying capacity rather than to decrease sickling.

Since the percentage of blood volume replaced by simple transfusion in this scenario will be high, exchange transfusion generally will not be needed in such patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indications-and-hemoglobin-thresholds-for-red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-the-adult\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Indications and hemoglobin thresholds for red blood cell transfusion in the adult&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preoperative transfusion to reduce complications of surgery, based on clinical trial data in which simple transfusion was found to be effective.

In addition, simple transfusions may increase the blood viscosity, while exchange transfusions do not. (See <a href=\"#H149628\" class=\"local\">'Risk of hyperviscosity syndrome from simple transfusion'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H149628\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk of hyperviscosity syndrome from simple transfusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blood viscosity is determined by an interrelationship between total Hgb, percent HgbS, blood flow rate, white blood cell count, and other parameters. As the blood viscosity increases beyond a threshold, oxygen delivery decreases (even if the Hgb level has been increased). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-polycythemia#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal polycythemia&quot;, section on 'Hyperviscosity'</a>.)</p><p>Simple blood transfusions can cause hyperviscosity syndrome in children or adults with SCD because they raise the Hgb, but only marginally lower the percentage of HgbS. Baseline HgbS levels in individuals with SCD are at least 90 percent of total Hgb, and typically after simple transfusion, the percentage of HgbS remains &gt;75 percent. In contrast, an exchange transfusion can lower the HgbS levels to &lt;30 percent. The higher HgbS levels that remain following simple transfusion contribute significantly to higher blood viscosity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p>Symptoms of hyperviscosity are non-specific and related to the affected vascular bed. Central nervous system hyperviscosity can cause signs of acute neurologic injury, and can be associated with central venous thrombosis or cerebral infarcts. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-stroke-in-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute stroke in sickle cell disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There is no general consensus regarding how to manage individuals with SCD at risk for hyperviscosity (ie, with Hgb above 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> and HgbS &gt;50 percent of total Hgb). Based on our experience, we use the following strategies to prevent hyperviscosity syndrome:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We minimize the use of simple blood transfusion therapy in individuals who have a Hgb &gt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> and a HgbS percentage &gt;50 percent of total Hgb.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If a patient's Hgb has been inadvertently raised above 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> with simple transfusions and the HgbS levels are &gt;50 percent of total Hgb, we use phlebotomy to decrease the Hgb level closer to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We use phlebotomy for all patients with a post-transfusion Hgb &ge;13.0 and HgbS &gt;50 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4621924\"><span class=\"h2\">Exchange blood transfusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Exchange transfusion involves removing some of the patient's own blood and transfusing allogeneic blood, thereby lowering the concentration of HgbS through dilution. A cardinal principle in transfusing individuals with SCD who are critically ill is that exchange transfusion provides greater benefit compared with simple transfusion because only exchange transfusion can significantly lower HgbS levels (ie, to &lt;30 percent of total Hgb). The lessened effects on viscosity for a given Hgb level are critical in potentially reversing vaso-occlusion and improving blood flow. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanisms-of-vaso-occlusion-in-sickle-cell-disease#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanisms of vaso-occlusion in sickle cell disease&quot;, section on 'Multiple pathway model'</a>.)</p><p>Exchange transfusion therapy can involve full blood volume exchange by manual or automated apheresis. A full exchange transfusion allows for rapid lowering of the HgbS level to 30 percent or less, and correction of anemia. Partial exchange transfusion refers to a limited exchange transfusion that is less effective in lowering the HgbS level but is more easily performed. In order to lower the HgbS below 30 percent, repeat partial exchange transfusions may be necessary.</p><p>Randomized trials analyzing the benefit of simple versus exchange transfusion for treating specific complications in SCD have not been performed. Clinical experience coupled with several limited observational studies suggests that exchange transfusion, either automated apheresis or manual, is superior to simple blood transfusion in suspected stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>], respiratory failure, and multi-organ failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. We employ exchange transfusions in the following situations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For acute emergencies, when the patient is acutely ill and deteriorating quickly (eg, multi-organ failure, suspected stroke, respiratory compromise, acute chest syndrome); of note, hypotension is not a contraindication to exchange transfusion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For regularly scheduled transfusions used in the prevention of stroke, acute chest syndrome, and recurrent painful episodes.</p><p/><p>In general, automated apheresis is preferred over manual exchange because it can be done faster and causes fewer volume shifts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. However, a study that compared automated versus manual methods in 39 children receiving chronic transfusion for stroke prevention (1353 total transfusion sessions), both methods were effective and well tolerated, with a median reduction in the percentage of HgbS levels of approximately 20 percent with both methods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Importantly, manual exchange should be performed by a dedicated team with experience in the procedure and using quality controls and adverse event monitoring.</p><p>In clinical situations where the exchange may be considered as part of standard care (acute chest syndrome, multi-organ failure, or strokes) without availability of apheresis or local expertise to perform a manual exchange, the patient should be transferred to a facility to perform apheresis or manual exchange, as these decisions are often time sensitive.</p><p>With acute organ deterioration, such as respiratory failure, stroke, or multi-organ failure, we suggest lowering the HgbS level into the range of 15 to 20 percent, and raising the total Hgb to the range of 10 to 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span>. Although strong evidence-based data confirming that a HgbS of 15 to 20 percent is better than 30 percent are lacking, the rationale for this approach is twofold. First, in critically ill patients, this approach is thought to minimize sickling complications. Second, the HgbS level is unlikely to increase above a threshold of 30 percent within four weeks. Thus, this HgbS target decreases the likelihood of requiring another exchange blood transfusion for at least three weeks to keep the HgbS level &lt;30 percent.</p><p>A further benefit of RBC apheresis over simple transfusion is the prevention or minimization of excess iron stores. RBC apheresis decreases the degree of excess iron accumulation when compared with simple blood transfusion therapy and may delay, or in few cases eliminate, the need for chelation therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/61-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">61-63</a>]. Regular manual modified exchange transfusion therapy has been shown to decrease net iron balance compared with regular simple blood transfusion therapy, but with less benefit in net iron balance than RBC apheresis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].

As an example, in the SIT trial there were 3236 transfusions administered; of these, nine participants had one reaction, six had two reactions, and one had four reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Eight of 3236 transfusions (0.2 percent) were associated a FNHTR and 13 of 3236 (0.4 percent) with an allergic reaction. Patients with an acute transfusion reaction are generally treated similarly to individuals without SCD. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-a-suspected-acute-transfusion-reaction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with a suspected acute transfusion reaction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>One issue that may arise is concern about the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meperidine-pethidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meperidine</a> in the setting of an acute transfusion-associated rigor, which may make the patient or family very uncomfortable (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunologic-transfusion-reactions#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunologic transfusion reactions&quot;, section on 'Febrile nonhemolytic reactions'</a>). This concern is due to experience with potential toxicities of meperidine when used for an extended period of time in patients with SCD (eg, for treating pain). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaso-occlusive-pain-management-in-sickle-cell-disease#H2870181\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vaso-occlusive pain management in sickle cell disease&quot;, section on 'Therapies we do not use'</a>.)</p><p>This concern about <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meperidine-pethidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meperidine</a> does not apply to short-term use (eg, &lt;24 hours) in the setting of an acute reaction, as long as the patient has normal renal and neurologic function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/69,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">69,70</a>]; such individuals may be treated with meperidine if needed. However, meperidine can be sedating, and we generally prefer to use non-sedating histamine 1 receptor antagonist in this setting. Of importance, rigors associated with FNHTR are acute and self-limited; if there are any signs that suggest possible bacterial infection, the patient should be evaluated and treated accordingly, as patients with SCD are functionally asplenic and at risk of serious morbidities and mortality from sepsis.

Alloimmunization can lead to hemolysis (typically, a delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction [DHTR]). In a 2017 prospective study of 694 transfusion episodes in 311 patients over a 30-month period, the incidence of DHTR was approximately 5 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. In a 2015 retrospective review of 220 individuals with SCD receiving transfusions over a five-year period, 17 experienced a DHTR (8 percent); this represented 23 of 2158 (1 percent) of transfusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. Of note, 11 of these reactions (48 percent) were not appreciated at the time; most were misdiagnosed as a vaso-occlusive event.</p><p>Other forms of immune hemolysis can also occur. As an example, autoantibodies (antibodies that recognize the patient's own RBCs) have been reported in 7 to 47 percent of patients receiving transfusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. An autoantibody is more likely to develop in patients who have already been alloimmunized. Some patients have a nonspecific, transient, weakly positive direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test that has no specificity and is not associated with hemolysis. However, a new autoantibody can cause marked hemolysis and should undergo reference laboratory evaluation.</p><p>Acute hemolytic transfusion reactions (AHTRs) can also occur. These are typically caused by clerical error with transfusion of the wrong ABO group blood; an AHTR is a medical emergency due to rapid intravascular lysis of RBCs.

Unlike individuals without SCD, in whom a DHTR is associated with a positive direct antiglobulin (Coombs) test with a specific antibody, in SCD a DHTR can be more serious and difficult to diagnose.

The patient often has pain with evidence of hemolysis but a low reticulocyte count. Analysis of the hemoglobin pattern (eg, by electrophoresis) demonstrates not only disappearance of the transfused hemoglobin A-containing RBCs but also a &quot;bystander&quot; hemolysis of the patient's sickle cell blood. These events are serious and can be life threatening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-sickle-cell-disease/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. In some cases there will be multiple alloantibodies, making it difficult to obtain compatible RBCs for transfusion.

Chelation therapy in SCD is managed similarly to that for other chronically transfused, iron-overloaded individuals (eg, beta thalassemia major). However, it is important to note that in thalassemia the optimal iron levels and guidelines for initiation of chelation therapy are evolving toward maintenance of lower iron stores, based on decreasing the long-term, iron-induced organ dysfunction observed in thalassemia.

Ferritin levels need to be serially measured at least every three to four months, and must be drawn in the steady state (ie, separate from acute inflammatory or vaso-occlusive events). We prefer to draw the ferritin levels with each blood draw (in the routine outpatient setting) so that we can easily monitor the trend for the individual, which is likely to be more important than a single measure.

(See <a href=\"#H13340695\" class=\"local\">'Rationale for transfusion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transfusions are indicated to treat severe uncompensated anemia and severe vaso-occlusive phenomena including multiorgan failure, acute stroke, and acute chest syndrome; and preoperatively in most patients. The largest <strong>misuse</strong> of blood transfusion is for an adult with SCD with an uncomplicated vaso-occlusive pain episode without symptomatic anemia, for which there is no evidence of benefit. Simple transfusion can increase oxygen carrying capacity in patients with severe anemia. Exchange transfusion provides greater benefit in critically ill patients and those with vaso-occlusion, by lowering hemoglobin S levels without increasing blood viscosity; automated apheresis is generally preferred over manual exchange.

Patients with HbSC require an individualized approach and are managed according to disease severity. Individuals with SCD undergoing elective, minor, low-risk procedures may not require transfusion.
