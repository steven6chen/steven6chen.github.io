It is administered by subcutaneous injection twice a day before meals. Exenatide also reduces glucagon secretion and decreases gastric motility. Its effect on glucose levels is predominantly postprandial. Exenatide reduces glycated hemoglobin (A1C) values by 0.5 to 1.0 percent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucagon-like-peptide-1-receptor-agonists-for-the-treatment-of-type-2-diabetes-mellitus#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Exenatide twice daily'</a>.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=exenatide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Exenatide</a> causes gastrointestinal (GI) side effects (notably nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea) in a large proportion of patients. Its use is associated with modest weight loss, due at least in part to the GI side effects. (Occasionally a patient will experience appreciable weight loss.)</p><p>The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued an alert about a possible association of incretin-based drugs such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exenatide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">exenatide</a> (and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sitagliptin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sitagliptin</a>) with acute pancreatitis based upon a review of 30 postmarketing reports, in some of which a causal relationship between these agents and acute pancreatitis was suspected. The FDA and the European Medicines Agency now agree that there is insufficient evidence to confirm an increased risk of pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer with the use of GLP-1 based therapies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interactive-diabetes-case-16-a-61-year-old-man-with-uncontrolled-type-2-diabetes-on-two-oral-agents-a2/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Pancreatitis continues to be considered a risk associated with these drugs. Concerns remain, and monitoring for and reporting of pancreatic adverse effects continues. Exenatide is contraindicated in patients with a personal or family history of medullary thyroid carcinoma and in patients with the multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2.</p><p>Because its effect depends on beta cell responsiveness, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exenatide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">exenatide</a> is approved for use in patients with type 2 diabetes treated with oral agents but not in patients with insulin-treated type 2 diabetes or type 1 diabetes.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=exenatide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Exenatide</a> is approved for use with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a>, a sulfonylurea, or both. It has little advantage over insulin for the diabetic patient who is not in control on one or two oral agents. Like insulin, it is injected. Unlike insulin, it often causes GI side effects. It should not be used in patients with gastroparesis. It is expensive.</p><p>Return to the beginning to try again.
