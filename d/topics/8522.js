Patients with HCM have an increased incidence of both supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias and are at an increased risk for sudden cardiac death (SCD).

A small subset of patients, however, remains at risk for a number of adverse disease-related complications including: sudden death, usually in the absence of symptoms; progressive HF symptoms occasionally associated with systolic dysfunction; and atrial fibrillation with risk of thromboembolic stroke.</p><p>The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and evaluation of HCM will be reviewed here. Other issues such as the natural history and treatment of this disorder are discussed separately.

Subsequently, newer techniques (ie, genetic testing, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging) have increased recognition of the HCM phenotype and improved clinical diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. In addition, prior epidemiologic studies did not take into account autosomal dominant transmission of HCM, with often multiple affected family members for each proband identified. For these reasons, the prevalence of HCM in the general population has been estimated to be closer to 1 out of every 200 adults (0.5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H274517\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTOLOGIC FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Histopathology in patients with HCM reveals hypertrophied myocytes arranged in a chaotic and disorganized fashion with a varying amount of interstitial fibrosis intertwined among the myocyte. In addition, the intramural coronary arterioles are structurally abnormal with decreased luminal cross-sectional area and impaired vasodilatory capacity resulting in blunted myocardial blood flow during stress (ie, &quot;small vessel ischemia&quot;). Over time, repetitive bouts of small vessel ischemia lead to myocyte cell death and ultimately repair in the form of replacement fibrosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F55914\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55914 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H274524\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many patients with HCM have no or only minor symptoms; thus, affected individuals are often diagnosed as a result of family screening, detection of a murmur during routine examination, or the identification of an abnormal ECG. However, among those who come to clinical attention at referral centers, left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) gradients and symptoms of dyspnea, fatigue, chest pain, and syncope are the most common clinical manifestations. Patients with mild to moderate limitation usually experience slow progression of symptoms with advancing age in association with a modest deterioration in LV function.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H274531\"><span class=\"h2\">Signs and symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The signs and symptoms of HCM are variable, and there is not a strong correlation between the presence or magnitude of LVOT obstruction, the extent of LV hypertrophy (LVH), and symptoms. Some patients with severe LVOT obstruction remain asymptomatic for many years, while others without LVOT obstruction may have significant limitation. </p><p>While many patients with HCM are asymptomatic, others develop one or more of the following symptoms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dyspnea on exertion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fatigue</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Atypical or anginal chest pain </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presyncope and syncope, particularly during or immediately following exertion </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palpitation</p><p/><p>Advanced heart failure (HF) symptoms of orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, and edema are uncommon. The frequency of symptoms at diagnosis varies considerably depending on whether the population being studied is a cross section of the overall population or patients at a referral center [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/2,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,11,12</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a series of 320 patients from three referral centers, transthoracic echocardiography was performed in all patients, with subsequent stress echocardiography only in those whose LVOT gradient was &lt;50 mmHg at rest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The following findings were noted:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>169 patients (59 percent) had New York Heart Association (NYHA) Class II or greater dyspnea at presentation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>119 patients (37 percent) had a resting LVOT gradient &ge;50 mmHg, while 201 patients (63 percent) had a resting LVOT gradient &lt;50 mmHg (mean 4 mmHg). With exercise, 76 (24 percent) developed an LVOT gradient &ge;50 mmHg, and 46 (14 percent) developed dyspnea with exertion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>95 patients (30 percent) were asymptomatic with little or no gradient (&le;30 mmHg) at rest or with exertion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 277 outpatients from a regional cohort (non-referral population) who were followed for eight years, approximately 90 percent were asymptomatic at presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. During the eight-year follow-up, 69 percent remained asymptomatic or had only mild symptoms, and survival in adults was similar to a normal control age-matched population. </p><p/><p>Thus, among patients referred for evaluation of HCM, both HF symptoms and outflow gradients are common, although in many cases exercise testing may be necessary to demonstrate these abnormalities.</p><p>The clinical presentation also may be affected by gender. In a review of 969 consecutive patients from the United States and Italy, women were significantly older at presentation than men (47 versus 38 years), more symptomatic (New York Heart Association class 1.8 versus 1.4) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52683\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52683 \">table 1</a>), and more likely to have LVOT obstruction (37 versus 23 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. At a mean follow-up of 6.2 years, women had significantly higher rates of progression to NYHA class III or IV and death from HF or stroke. </p><p>Symptoms can be induced by a variety of mechanisms which may include LVOT obstruction, impaired myocardial function, brady- or tachyarrhythmias, or impaired filling due to diastolic dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The importance of these mechanisms may change with time and stage of disease. Some patients, for example, are initially symptomatic because of obstruction. As the myocardial disease worsens over time, the heart may enlarge, obstruction lessens, and symptoms are primarily due to systolic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diastolic dysfunction.

Some patients also complain of prolonged episodes of atypical chest pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. This chest pain is commonly precipitated or worsened by heavy meals.

Factors that increase myocardial oxygen demand include myocyte hypertrophy and increased muscle mass, myocyte disarray (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F73467\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73467 \">picture 2</a>), and LVOT obstruction and increased wall stress due to elevated diastolic pressures. Factors that reduce myocardial blood flow in HCM, particularly with exertion, include impaired vasodilator reserve, myocardial bridging with systolic and early diastolic compression of intramural vessels, small vessel disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F55914\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55914 \">picture 1</a>) and microvascular dysfunction, myocardial fibrosis, and increased capillary separation and inadequate capillary density [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/16,18-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,18-23</a>].</p><p>Many studies have shown that, during pacing or pharmacologic stress, myocardial blood flow is abnormal in patients with HCM and often associated with metabolic evidence for myocardial ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/15,18,22,24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,18,22,24,25</a>].

Outflow tract gradients in HCM are dynamic, characterized by spontaneous variability on a day-to-day (or even hourly) basis, and influenced by factors that alter myocardial contractility and loading conditions (eg, dehydration, ingestion of alcohol, or heavy meals). As such, for patients who do not have evidence of LVOT obstruction under resting conditions, an attempt should be made at provoking gradients as the presence of LVOT obstruction will affect management decisions. Exercise (stress) echocardiography using a standard symptom limited Bruce protocol is the preferred method as this mimics most closely the conditions that patients would be experiencing provocable gradients with daily activities. Alternatively, pharmacologic agents (ie, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amyl-nitrite-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amyl nitrite</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dobutamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dobutamine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoproterenol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoproterenol</a>) and Valsalva maneuver can also be employed to induce gradients, although these are nonphysiologic maneuvers that may not reflect the true magnitude of outflow gradients experienced during routine daily activities.

Therefore, for patients who do not have obstruction under resting conditions, provoking gradients for the purpose of management decisions is crucial. Exercise (stress) echocardiography using a standard symptom limited Bruce protocol is the preferred method as this mimics most closely the conditions that patients would be experiencing on a daily basis.

Exercise treadmill testing is the preferred method of stress, rather than using a pharmacologic stress agent, as a maximal treadmill or bicycle exercise stress test provides an objective measurement of functional capacity and information on the integrity of vascular responses and the risk of exercise related ischemia, arrhythmia, and obstruction. In addition, the results of exercise stress testing may lead to a change in patient management (eg, inducible ventricular arrhythmias or inducible LVOT gradient). The decision to add an imaging modality such as echocardiography or myocardial perfusion imaging to the stress test should be based on the usual indications for imaging during stress testing (eg, baseline electrocardiogram is uninterpretable).

Occasionally, however, the abnormal BP response is due to failure to increase cardiac output or the development of global myocardial ischemia or LVOT obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/29,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,55</a>]. The exact trigger for a drop in BP during exercise is usually not known.

The amount of LGE can be quantified as a percent of the total LV mass. Approximately half of patients with HCM demonstrate LGE, with a diverse pattern and location (not related to a coronary vascular distribution), although most commonly involving hypertrophied segments of the LV wall and at the junctions of the ventricular septum and right ventricular free wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. </p><p>In a prospective multicenter cohort of almost 1300 patients with HCM who underwent quantitative contrast-CMR, extensive LGE was an independent predictor of sudden death, with &ge;15 percent of LV mass conveying a twofold increase in sudden death risk, even among those patients with HCM who do not have conventional sudden death markers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. Observational studies have also suggested that patients with HCM and LGE were at greater risk for ventricular tachyarrhythmias on ambulatory 24-hour Holter ECG compared with those without LGE, suggesting that myocardial fibrosis may represent the structural nidus responsible for the generation of potentially lethal reentry ventricular tachyarrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].

In both situations, concentric LVH develops, which is different than the eccentric hypertrophy seen in HCM. Valvular AS can usually be distinguished from other causes of LVH by echocardiography or invasive cardiac catheterization, which allow for visualization of the restricted leaflet motion.

As a result, a number of noninvasive measures have been proposed to help differentiate athlete's heart from HCM (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F87658\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87658 \">figure 7</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/56,86\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,86</a>]. </p><p>Various exercise training disciplines appear to have qualitatively and quantitatively different effects on cardiac structure and function.

Hyperdynamic LV function results in more vigorous ejection of blood from the heart at a higher velocity than normal, leading to an intracavitary gradient which may be mistaken for an increased LVOT gradient.

In approximately 50 percent of these individuals, the ECG will be abnormal. Although these patients have no increased wall thickness, a number of observations have suggested that the myocardium may still not be structurally normal. For example, abnormalities such as myocardial fibrosis by contrast-cardiac magnetic resonance, collagen biomarkers, mitral leaflet elongation, diastolic dysfunction, and blood-filled myocardial crypts have all been shown to occur in gene carriers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-evaluation/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. </p><p>The likelihood of developing clinical evidence of HCM with LVH in family members who have a sarcomere mutation is uncertain.

The prevalence of HCM in the general population is 1 in 500 adults. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H274510\" class=\"local\">'Prevalence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Histopathology in patients with HCM reveals disorganized myocyte architecture, including hypertrophied myocytes in a disarray pattern with bizarre-shaped nuclei, abnormal intramural coronary arteries, and interstitial as well as replacement fibrosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F55914\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55914 \">picture 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H274517\" class=\"local\">'Histologic findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While many patients with HCM remain asymptomatic, it is not uncommon for patients to develop one or more of the following symptoms: dyspnea on exertion, orthopnea, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, chest pain, palpitations, <span class=\"nowrap\">presyncope/syncope,</span> postural lightheadedness, fatigue, or edema. (See <a href=\"#H274531\" class=\"local\">'Signs and symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The physical examination in HCM may be normal or may reveal nonspecific abnormalities such as a fourth heart sound, systolic murmur, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an LV lift. Patients with LV outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction may have a harsh crescendo-decrescendo systolic murmur, which develops slightly after S1 and is heard best at the apex and lower left sternal border. Several physical exam maneuvers can affect the degree of obstruction, resulting in a change in murmur intensity. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The evaluation for HCM in an individual patient may be prompted by a family history of HCM, systolic ejection murmur, abnormal 12-lead electrocardiogram showing otherwise unexplained evidence of LV hypertrophy (LVH), and clinical symptoms including syncope. In addition to performing a comprehensive cardiac history and physical examination and an electrocardiogram (ECG) in all patients with suspected HCM, cardiac imaging to identify LVH should be performed. (See <a href=\"#H18608369\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although the ECG is abnormal in 90 percent of patients with HCM (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F76497\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef76497 \">waveform 3</a>), no specific pattern is diagnostic. Typically, the ECG shows repolarization abnormalities but also may include prominent abnormal Q waves, P wave abnormalities, left axis deviation, and deeply inverted T waves. (See <a href=\"#H612576623\" class=\"local\">'Electrocardiography'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two-dimensional echocardiography can be used to reliably diagnose patients with HCM when an area of increased LV wall thickness is imaged anywhere in the LV wall in the absence of another cause. Echocardiographic findings suggestive of HCM include LVH (particularly when asymmetric and involving the septum or anterolateral wall), an increased LVOT gradient, and systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflets, particularly when associated with an increased LVOT gradient. In addition, cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) can be used to clarify a diagnosis of HCM or the extent of wall thickness in those patients in whom LV wall thickness measurements remain uncertain with two-dimensional echocardiography. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Echocardiography'</a> above and <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Cardiovascular magnetic resonance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The majority of patients with HCM have LVOT obstruction under resting conditions or following exercise. Because of this, we proceed with exercise stress testing in all patients with known or suspected HCM as part of the risk stratification process. Exercise should be performed as the stress agent rather than using a pharmacologic stress agent, as a maximal treadmill or bicycle exercise stress test provides an objective measurement of functional capacity and information on the integrity of vascular responses and the risk of exercise related ischemia, arrhythmia, and obstruction. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Exercise testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Genetic testing is available for clinical use but is predominately reserved for identifying patients who may have a disease which appears phenotypically similar to sarcomere HCM, such as Fabry disease or a <span class=\"nowrap\">lysosomal/glycogen</span> storage disease, or to help identify family members who may be at risk of developing HCM. (See <a href=\"#H15396849\" class=\"local\">'Genetic testing for HCM'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of HCM can usually be made following echocardiography <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> CMR imaging, and invasive diagnostic assessments are rarely necessary. We typically reserve invasive hemodynamic assessment using cardiac catheterization for patients with suspected HCM to exclude obstructive coronary artery disease, distinguish pericardial constriction from severe restrictive physiology, to perform endomyocardial biopsy to exclude nonsarcomeric causes of HCM, or for pre-cardiac transplant assessment. (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Cardiac catheterization'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the patient presenting with LVH, HCM must be distinguished from acquired causes of cardiac hypertrophy, including hypertension, aortic stenosis, and athlete's heart. Other than the dynamic subaortic (LVOT) obstruction seen in HCM, several other anatomic and physiologic abnormalities can be associated with increased pressure gradients between the LV and the aorta, including volume depletion, subaortic stenosis, and valvular aortic stenosis.
