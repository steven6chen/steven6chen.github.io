Bruises happen when blood vessels under the skin break, but the skin isn't cut. When the blood vessels break, blood leaks into the tissues under the skin and makes it change color.</p><p>A black eye starts off red in color, and then turns blue or purple. As it heals, a black eye can turn green and yellow. Often, the swelling gets worse in the first day after the injury or when you wake up the next morning. Most black eyes heal in 1 to 2 weeks, but some take longer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6700742\"><span class=\"h1\">How is a black eye treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A black eye doesn't need treatment. It will get better on its own. But you can &quot;ice&quot; your black eye to make it feel better and help it heal. To do this, put a cold gel pack, bag of ice, or bag of frozen vegetables on the injured area every 1 to 2 hours, for 15 minutes each time. Put a thin towel between the ice (or other cold object) and your skin. Use the ice (or other cold object) for at least 6 hours after your injury. Some people find it helpful to ice longer, even up to 2 days after their injury.</p><p>You can also take medicines such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">acetaminophen</a> (sample brand name: Tylenol) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin) to help with the pain and swelling. But people who have certain conditions or take certain medicines should not take ibuprofen. If you aren't sure whether you can take ibuprofen, ask your doctor or nurse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6700757\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>See your doctor or nurse right away if you have any of these symptoms with your black eye:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any problems seeing, such as blurred vision or double vision</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Very bad pain in your eye, especially when trying to move it from side to side</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding from the eye</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea and vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A slow heart rate</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing through your nose</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A nose that looks crooked</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6700772\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. Most people don't need tests for a black eye, but your doctor might want you to have an eye exam. Plus, if you are having trouble seeing or moving your eye, your doctor might take a special kind of X-ray called a CT scan. The CT scan will show if any of the bones around your eye are broken. It can also show if you have damage to the eyeball itself.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6700789\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=taking-care-of-bruises-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Taking care of bruises (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
