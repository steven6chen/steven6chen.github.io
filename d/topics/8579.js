Between 2006 and 2010, of those women who used some type of contraception, 27 percent chose female sterilization, 28 percent chose an oral form of contraception, and 16 percent reported using condoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-sterilization/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>For women who no longer desire fertility, sterilization is a safe and highly effective option. Hysteroscopic sterilization can be performed in an outpatient setting and is the least invasive approach to female sterilization.</p><p>Hysteroscopic sterilization will be reviewed here. An overview of general principles of female sterilization, as well as postpartum and laparoscopic sterilization and general issues related to hysteroscopy, are discussed separately.

Some methods require visualization of the tubal ostia with hysteroscopy, while others do not. Methods that have been attempted include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Corrosive agents &ndash; nitric acid, phenol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-sterilization/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], quinacrine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-sterilization/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], methyl cyanoacrylate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-sterilization/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mechanical obstruction devices &ndash; silicone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-sterilization/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], polyethylene, nylon, ceramic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-sterilization/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Destruction using thermal energy &ndash; electrosurgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-sterilization/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], YAG laser [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-sterilization/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]</p><p/><p>The majority of these methods are not in use.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20189330\"><span class=\"h2\">Micro-insert (only available in the United States)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One hysteroscopic sterilization device is available in the United States: the micro-insert system (Essure), approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in 2002.</p><p>For this topic review, use of the terms &quot;micro-insert&quot; or &quot;Essure&quot; will refer specifically to the currently available version of the device.</p><p>The device is a metal and polymer micro-insert 4 cm long and 1 to 2 mm wide when deployed. It consists of an inner coil of stainless steel and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) fibers and an outer coil of nickel-titanium (nitinol). It comes loaded in a single-use delivery system.</p><p>The device is placed under hysteroscopic guidance in the proximal fallopian tube (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F73083\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73083 \">figure 1</a>). The coil initially is in a tightly wound state and then is deployed to an expanded state that anchors the insert in the tube. After placement, the PET fibers stimulate benign tissue growth that surrounds and infiltrates the device over the course of several weeks, resulting in tubal occlusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-sterilization/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Twelve weeks after placement, a hysterosalpingogram must be performed to confirm tubal occlusion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F60277\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef60277 \">image 1</a>). Contraception must be used until satisfactory micro-insert location and bilateral tubal occlusion are confirmed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2493969593\"><span class=\"h3\">Availability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In 2017, the manufacturer withdrew the Essure device from all markets, except the United States, based on &quot;commercial reasons&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-sterilization/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

Information about the device that is relevant to the care of women who had the device placed is included here and in relevant sections below.</p><p>The polymer matrix device was placed by use of a low level of radiofrequency energy (resulting in a lesion within the superficial layer of cells in the tubal lumens that was 5 mm long and 500 microns deep) followed by placement of a 3.5 mm nonabsorbable silicone elastomer matrix in each tubal lumen. The device cannot be visualized with a radiograph.</p><p>The only study regarding the efficacy of the polymer matrix was a prospective series of 645 women, as noted above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-sterilization/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Among 553 women who had confirmed bilateral tubal occlusion and who completed follow-up, the pregnancy rate at one year was 1.1 percent. Two-year follow-up data for 321 women showed a 1.8 percent pregnancy rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-sterilization/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. With the exception of spring clip application, this pregnancy rate is higher than other methods reported in the United States Collaborative Review of Sterilization (CREST) study (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F54215\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54215 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laparoscopic-female-sterilization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laparoscopic female sterilization&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H175751613\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT SELECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Appropriate patient selection increases the likelihood of successful placement of hysteroscopic sterilization micro-inserts and long-term patient tolerance and satisfaction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4185225988\"><span class=\"h2\">Our approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In our current practices, when a woman requests a tubal sterilization procedure, we typically recommend three alternatives that we believe are superior: vasectomy, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levonorgestrel-intrauterine-device-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levonorgestrel intrauterine device</a> (IUD) or copper IUD. All three alternatives have excellent outcomes including very low rates of post-procedure pregnancy and utilize fewer resources than tubal sterilization. If a woman declines those three alternatives, we prefer laparoscopic over hysteroscopic tubal sterilization because hysteroscopic sterilization is associated with a higher rate of post-procedure complications necessitating additional surgery. Additionally, many women request removal of the hysteroscopically placed tubal inserts because they attribute serious symptoms to the inserts, including pelvic pain, allergy to nickel, autoimmune disorders, and menstrual abnormalities. Removal often requires laparoscopy with general anesthesia. Hysteroscopic sterilization is seldom performed in our health systems but is still offered as an option after careful consideration and counseling in certain situations, for example, for a woman with severe pulmonary hypertension in whom general anesthesia and laparoscopy may be contraindicated.</p><p>Counseling patients about contraceptive options is discussed in detail separately.

However, in 2011, the US Food and Drug Administration removed known hypersensitivity to nickel as a contraindication for the procedure, since the number of adverse events reported had been extremely low (less than 1 in 5000) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-sterilization/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Since that time, there has been increasing concern about inflammatory effects that may be related to metal allergy.

Women should also be informed that there is a three-month delay between the procedure and the ability to rely on it for contraception, and that an additional test (hysterosalpingogram [HSG]) will be required at three months postinsertion to confirm correct placement, and during this time alternative contraception must be used. Patients should also be adequately counseled regarding the risks of this procedure compared with traditional laparoscopic sterilization, both immediate and long-term. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Confirming occlusion'</a> below and <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below.)</p><p>Other consent issues are the same as for other hysteroscopic procedures.

Successful placement of hysteroscopic sterilization micro-inserts with an IUD in place has been reported with success rates up to 100 percent in small case series of 6, 12, and 20 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-sterilization/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>]. In these small case series, three-month HSG showed bilateral tubal occlusion. Patients should be counseled that, in approximately 8 to 10 percent of women, the tubal ostia will not be visible and the IUD will need to be removed intraoperatively. Data on safety of this technique are limited. The three-month HSG can be performed with the IUD in place, followed by removal if correct micro-insert placement and bilateral tubal occlusion are confirmed. The IUD may also be retained, if indicated for the treatment of abnormal uterine bleeding, endometrial hyperplasia, or other gynecologic conditions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing and endometrial preparation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A clear view of the tubal ostia is the key element to the success of the procedure. To optimize visualization, the procedure should be performed while the endometrium is thin. A thin endometrium is best achieved by pretreating with a progestin; options include estrogen-progestin contraceptives (pill, ring, or patch), progestin-only contraceptive pills, or depot <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medroxyprogesterone-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">medroxyprogesterone acetate</a>. While there are no data regarding the best method of endometrial preparation, in our experience, progestin-only agents are more effective at endometrial thinning than combined estrogen-progestin formulations. Some experts pretreat with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a>) to minimize tubal spasm. At present, there are no data to support such pretreatment.</p><p>In women who are using a progestin-containing contraceptive, the procedure can be scheduled at any time other than during menses.</p><p>In our experience, women who are not already using a progestin-containing contraceptive can be pretreated with a progestin-only contraceptive initiated with the start of menses. These agents provide the dual effect of endometrial lining suppression and birth control, which can be continued for the three-month follow-up period.</p><p>For women in whom a progestin is contraindicated or who do not wish to use hormonal contraception, the best time to view the ostia is shortly after menses during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle.

Note whether both tubal ostia can be visualized and are accessible; also note any pathology. The devices are single-use and should not be opened until visualization of both ostia is confirmed. Hysteroscopic entry is discussed in detail separately.

This will both reduce the risk of excessive fluid absorption and minimize endometrial tissue edema (which can obscure the view of the ostia). Prevention of tissue edema, which can develop within several minutes, is an important way of ensuring success of the procedure.

Position the hysteroscope in front of one of the tubal ostia while the assistant threads the first device delivery system into the introducer sheath. With the delivery system threaded, take hold of the device handle and guide the tip of the micro-insert through the tubal ostium into the fallopian tube (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F73083\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73083 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>The maneuvers to correctly position and deploy the device must be performed precisely.

The use of monopolar electrosurgical instruments for endometrial ablation following hysteroscopic sterilization with micro-inserts may lead to damage of surrounding tissues from inadvertent conduction of current, and should be avoided.</p><p>The safety of use of some endometrial ablation techniques following hysteroscopic sterilization is supported by few data. In several small observational studies, women who were scheduled for hysterectomy underwent hysteroscopic sterilization followed immediately by endometrial ablation (one with Essure and Thermachoice hot liquid-filled balloon ablation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-sterilization/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>], one with Essure and NovaSure bipolar radiofrequency ablation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-sterilization/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>], and one with Adiana and NovaSure bipolar radiofrequency ablation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-sterilization/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]), followed by pathologic analysis of the uterus and fallopian tubes. These studies found no significant thermal injury to the tubes; one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-sterilization/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>] also reported no disruption of the position of the sterilization device and complete ablation results, with the exception of some sparing of the area near the tubal ostia. There are no long-term studies regarding the safety of this sequence of procedures or whether subsequent endometrial ablation affects the contraceptive efficacy of the sterilization procedure. Some studies have reported an increased risk of postablation pain syndrome in patients who have previous tubal sterilization, though these studies do not report the method of tubal sterilization and may or may not be applicable to hysteroscopic tubal occlusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-sterilization/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>].

At three months after the procedure, tubal occlusion must be confirmed with imaging.</p><p>The three-month follow-up period is based on early efficacy trials when the micro-insert device was tested in a small cohort of subjects undergoing subsequent hysterectomy. There are few data regarding a shorter interval to tubal occlusion for either device [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-sterilization/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p>Initially, in the United States, HSG was the only US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved standard for confirming bilateral tubal occlusion following hysteroscopic sterilization (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F60277\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef60277 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F58984\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef58984 \">image 2</a>). Unfortunately, there is a low rate of compliance with postoperative HSG (12 to 71 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-sterilization/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>].</p><p>It is important to note that tubal spasm may be misread as tubal occlusion on a HSG. Thus, for women in whom a device appears to be misplaced, but the tube appears occluded, the HSG should be repeated and alternative contraception should be continued.</p><p>History of tubal blockage, even when confirmed by HSG, is not sufficient to ensure contraceptive efficacy unless a device is also in the tube [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-sterilization/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>Since HSGs are costly, time-consuming, and uncomfortable, some experts use TVUS or pelvic radiography as an initial test for appropriate placement following micro-insert placement, with HSG reserved for patients in whom unsatisfactory placement is suspected. However, these imaging modalities cannot confirm tubal occlusion or identify tubal perforation; they can evaluate location of the micro-inserts.</p><p>In July 2015, the FDA approved TVUS as an alternative confirmation test for micro-insert placement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F73850\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef73850 \">image 3</a>). However, certification on TVUS from the manufacturer is required before a clinician can offer this option to patients in compliance with the FDA-approved labeling. Clinicians should continue to use the HSG method until they have received training and certification on the use of TVUS for micro-insert placement confirmation.</p><p>Representative reports regarding using pelvic radiograph or ultrasound to confirm tubal occlusion are listed below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a case series, 150 women underwent Essure procedures followed at 12 weeks by pelvic ultrasound, pelvic radiograph, and HSG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-sterilization/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].

According to the manufacturer, with the micro-inserts in place, electrosurgery should be avoided in procedures undertaken on the uterine cornua and proximal fallopian tubes without either hysteroscopic visualization of the micro-inserts, or visualization of the proximal portion of the fallopian tube via open surgical procedures or laparoscopy. During salpingectomy or other procedures in which electrosurgical instruments could contact the serosa of the fallopian tube, instruments should not be placed more proximal to location of the micro-inserts than the ampullary portion of the tube [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-sterilization/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].

By an intention-to-treat analysis, 87.5 percent of participants were able to rely on Essure for contraception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-sterilization/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. At 15-month follow-up, expulsion occurred in 14 women and perforation in 5 women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-sterilization/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. At five-year follow-up, there were an additional 15 adverse events &quot;possibly&quot; related to Essure, including heavy periods with or without pain (one woman underwent hysterectomy due to these symptoms), irregular periods with or without pain, dyspareunia, and spotting when ovulating [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-sterilization/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. There were no pregnancies. It is important to note that this study excluded 4 women who became pregnant before undergoing a hysterosalpingogram (HSG), 15 women who underwent hysterectomy, 1 woman who missed her six-month follow-up HSG, 1 woman who was incarcerated, 1 woman who had unsatisfactory device placement, and 1 woman with leukemia from the intention-to-treat analysis. Also, 30 percent of enrolled women did not complete the five-year follow-up. Thus, the results should be interpreted with caution. Overall, the device was well tolerated, and 96.6 percent of the participants were &quot;very satisfied&quot; with the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-sterilization/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>]. Another study found that women who undergo Essure hysteroscopic sterilization, compared with those undergoing laparoscopic sterilization, are at increased risk of needing further surgery, which may be repeat sterilization, hysterectomy, or correction of Essure-related complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-sterilization/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>The largest retrospective study was based on a French national hospital and health insurance databases and included 105,357 women who had undergone either hysteroscopic or laparoscopic sterilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-sterilization/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Hysteroscopic sterilization was associated with a lower risk of perioperative surgical (0.13 versus 0.78 percent) and medical (0.06 versus 0.11 percent) complications. Hysteroscopic sterilization was associated with a higher rate at three years of complications related to a genitourinary device (0.12 versus 0.01 percent). Hysteroscopic compared with laparoscopic sterilization was associated with higher rates of sterilization failure (defined as pregnancy, salpingectomy, or a second sterilization procedure) at one year (4.83 versus 0.69 percent) and three years (5.8 versus 1.3 percent), and a higher rate of subsequent gynecologic surgery at three years (9.0 versus 5.8 percent); this was mainly due to a higher salpingectomy rate. In contrast with some other reports, the rate of abnormal uterine bleeding was slightly lower after hysteroscopic sterilization at one and three (0.86 versus 1.1 percent) years. A limitation of the study was that pelvic pain rates were not reported; analgesic prescription rates were lower in women in the hysteroscopy group. Pelvic pain has been one of the important concerns in other studies, particularly in women with prior pain conditions. Also, the sterilization failure rate was a composite outcome, so intrauterine or ectopic pregnancy rates after the first sterilization procedure were not reported separately (pregnancy rate after a second sterilization procedure or to a poststerilization regret was reported).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1577161786\"><span class=\"h2\">Statements from regulatory organizations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In September 2015, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) convened a meeting of the Obstetrics and Gynecology Devices Panel to review the safety and effectiveness of Essure sterilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-sterilization/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>].

It is important to note that the Phase III study excluded women with a history of chronic pelvic pain, severe dysmenorrhea, severe dyspareunia, or chronic pain in the previous 12 months.</p><p>Some data suggest that pelvic pain after micro-insert sterilization is associated with a prior history of chronic pain. In a study based on insurance claims from 10,224 women who underwent hysteroscopic sterilization, at baseline, 23 percent of women had a pre-existing pelvic pain condition, and at two years, these women had a higher rate of chronic pelvic pain compared with other women (20 versus 9 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-sterilization/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].</p><p>These data complement a previous retrospective analysis of 458 women who underwent placement of micro-inserts and reported pelvic pain within the first three months in 8.1 percent of the patients and persistent pelvic pain after three months in 4.2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-sterilization/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. There was a sixfold increase in the risk of both acute and chronic pain in women with a previous diagnosis of a chronic pain condition such as chronic pelvic pain, chronic low back pain, chronic headache, or fibromyalgia.</p><p>Interestingly, a large retrospective study based on insurance claims data that included 27,724 women who underwent hysteroscopic sterilization found that, at two years, hysteroscopic compared with laparoscopic sterilization was associated with a lower rate of pelvic pain (21.0 versus 25.6 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-sterilization/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. </p><p>Surgery to remove the devices should be performed only after other etiologies of the pain have been excluded. In a retrospective study of 11 patients who underwent removal of their devices, eight (72 percent) reported resolution of their complaints, but three patient noted persistent problems, with two women reporting worsening of their pain and dyspareunia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-sterilization/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

In the Phase III study, women were required to have regular menses for two month prior to micro-insert placement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-sterilization/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. At 15-month follow-up, 2.2 percent of women reported heavier than usual menstrual flow, while 1.5 percent reported less than usual menstrual flow. At five years, recurrent menstrual symptoms included irregular menses (14.8 percent), intermenstrual bleeding (18.8 percent), heavier menstrual flow (37.5 percent), and lighter menstrual flow (23.3 percent).</p><p>A large retrospective study based on insurance claims data that included 27,724 women who underwent hysteroscopic sterilization found that, at two years, hysteroscopic compared with laparoscopic sterilization was associated with an increased rate of abnormal uterine bleeding (26.8 versus 22.3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-sterilization/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].</p><p>The study based on insurance claims from 10,224 women, cited above, also addressed AUB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-sterilization/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].

In a review of the MAUDE database from 2002 to 2012, almost 20 percent of adverse events reported were due to perforations.</p><p>Perforation during or following micro-insert placement may be asymptomatic or present as pelvic pain; some perforations were noted when a patient has a postprocedure pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-sterilization/abstract/59,76,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,76,77</a>]. While uncommon, complications from perforations have included bowel injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-sterilization/abstract/78,79\" class=\"abstract_t\">78,79</a>]. A tubal perforation may be suspected intraoperatively if a micro-insert is noted to move distally in a tube in an unusual manner.</p><p>Also, some cases were suspected postoperatively when a micro-insert was seen in an abnormal configuration on hysterosalpingogram (HSG), and subsequently confirmed using laparoscopy.

Placing the device too distally in the tube is considered to be a risk for migration, and providers should strive to have at least three expanded outer coils visible trailing into the uterus after placement.</p><p>A perforated or expulsed micro-insert that is protruding into or is free within the peritoneal cavity may need to be removed, since it may be a nidus for intraabdominal adhesions. At this time, there are not enough data to state definitively that the device must be removed or is safe to stay in asymptomatic patients. If the decision is made to remove the device, this can be accomplished using either hysteroscopy or laparoscopy, depending on the location of the device [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-sterilization/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. A patient planned for laparoscopy should be offered laparoscopic tubal ligation (using a non-electrosurgery method).</p><p>Uterine perforation is discussed in detail separately.

For instance, if a patient presents with sudden change in her menstrual flow or regularity, the clinician must first exclude other causes of abnormal bleeding. Even if the evaluation is negative, it may be prudent to try medical management (ie, for hormonal treatments for menstrual complaints and pain management for chronic pain symptoms) prior to surgical intervention.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Device malposition &ndash; Hysterosalpingogram or post-hysteroscopic sterilization imaging may detect malposition (sometimes referred to as migration) or fracturing of the coils. If the patient is asymptomatic, this can often be followed expectantly, as long as tubal occlusion is proven. If there is concern that device placement is associated with pain, bowel symptoms, urinary symptoms, menstrual irregularity, or nonocclusion of fallopian tubes, then device removal may be indicated.</p><p/><p>There are four reported methods to remove the Essure device from the fallopian tubes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hysteroscopic removal</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laparoscopic removal</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laparotomy with or without tubal reanastomosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hysterectomy with salpingectomy</p><p/><p>Because Essure is placed hysteroscopically, it can often be removed in the same manner. This method of removal is ideal in the few months just after insertion, prior to the induction of fibrosis around the coils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-sterilization/abstract/84,85\" class=\"abstract_t\">84,85</a>]. A hysteroscope with an operative channel is inserted in the uterine cavity, and a hysteroscopic grasper is used to gently tug (both the inner and outer) coils from the tubes as the scope is removed. A final view of the cavity should visualize no remaining pieces, and the coils should be inspected and counted for complete removal.</p><p>Laparoscopic removal has the advantage that it allows for a concomitant tubal ligation or excision procedure, to maintain the patient's desired sterilization. Laparoscopic removal is indicated if the removal is longer than months from insertion, there is concern for <span class=\"nowrap\">perforation/migration</span> of the coils with associated symptoms, or the coils cannot be visualized hysteroscopically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-sterilization/abstract/80,84\" class=\"abstract_t\">80,84</a>]. Our method uses three 5 mm laparoscopic ports. The tube is placed on gentle traction while the operator makes a linear 2 to 3 cm incision along the tube, starting at the cornua, with monopolar scissors or hook. Once the coil is visualized, it is gently grasped with Maryland forceps and tugged along its axis. Care is taken to remove both inner and outer coils in their entirety. After coil removal, we perform a bilateral salpingectomy. A hysteroscope can be placed to assure no trailing coils remain in the uterine cavity.</p><p>The laparotomy approach is described by one group with the goal of tubal reanastomosis and future fertility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-sterilization/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. A minilaparotomy low transverse incision is made, followed by placement of a uterine tourniquet. The fallopian tubes are opened sharply with a scalpel and the inserts dissected free. This is then followed by tubouterine implantation when desired by the patient. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=reproductive-surgery-for-female-infertility#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Reproductive surgery for female infertility&quot;, section on 'Tubal reanastomosis'</a>.)</p><p>The most definitive method for Essure removal is hysterectomy with bilateral salpingectomy. If the patient has indications for hysterectomy in addition to Essure-related complications, this method is reasonable. At this time, in our opinion, hysterectomy is generally not necessary without other indications, especially if laparoscopic removal is feasible.</p><p>Prior to attempted removal by any method, location of the coils via imaging (ultrasound, hysterosalpingography, or plain abdominal film) is used for surgical planning. An alternative is to use intraoperative fluoroscopy to identify a coil that is difficult to locate or has <span class=\"nowrap\">perforated/migrated</span> from the insertion site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-sterilization/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patient satisfaction is high after hysteroscopic sterilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-sterilization/abstract/11,35,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,35,51</a>].

The most important factor for correct bilateral micro-insert placement is adequate visualization of the tubal ostia. This was illustrated in a prospective multicenter study of Essure sterilization in which 469 women had presumed bilateral patent tubes (ie, no history of salpingectomy or radiographic evidence of tubal occlusion) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-sterilization/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. During a first procedure, micro-inserts were successfully placed bilaterally in 94 percent and unilaterally in 5 percent. Among women with unilateral placement, 13 of 15 underwent successful placement in a second procedure. Good visualization of the tubal ostium was the only factor associated with successful placement; other factors that did not have an effect were parity, type of anesthesia, premedication with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications, and concomitant procedures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32\"><span class=\"h2\">Contraceptive efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The efficacy of the Essure micro-inserts relies upon confirmation of correct placement and confirmation of tubal occlusion. Ideal use, as noted above, requires that the patient have imaging three months after placement. With typical use, it appears that many patients do not have the follow-up imaging. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Confirming occlusion'</a> above.)</p><p>There are conflicting data regarding the efficacy of the hysteroscopic micro-inserts: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Efficacy appeared to be at least similar to other methods of female sterilization. In the largest literature review to-date, which included 22 studies with approximately 66,773 micro-insert placements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-sterilization/abstract/89,90\" class=\"abstract_t\">89,90</a>]. There were 102 pregnancies (1.5 per 1000). Of these 102 pregnancies, 78 (76 percent) occurred in women who did not have post-procedure imaging to confirm tubal occlusion for imaging confirmation, did not use reliable contraception prior to confirmation imaging, or had misread imaging. Nine (8 percent) were determined to have been pregnant prior to placement. The remaining 15 (15 percent) of pregnancies occurred after three months in women in whom bilateral tubal occlusion or correct placement had been documented. In a report from the Netherlands, over 12 years, there were 35 reported pregnancies resulting from 27,346 sold micro-insert kits, suggesting an estimated pregnancy rate of 1.3 per 1000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-sterilization/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. There were no pregnancies identified after the devices had been confirmed to be properly placed. In a similar 10-year retrospective database analysis from Canada, 24 pregnancies were identified in 2080 procedures (1.2 per 1000) although only 17 were unintended. In this study, the cumulative failure rate was 0.29 percent over 10 years, and only one pregnancy was related to confirmed, properly placed devices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hysteroscopic-sterilization/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. With the exception of unipolar cautery, which is no longer practiced due to complications, this pregnancy risk is lower than other methods reported in the United States Collaborative Review of Sterilization (CREST) study (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F54215\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54215 \">table 1</a>).

Three months after placement, correct device placement and bilateral tubal occlusion are confirmed with pelvic imaging. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Hysteroscopic sterilization device'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Advantages of hysteroscopic sterilization compared with other approaches to female sterilization include the ability to perform the procedure in an outpatient setting and without an incision. A disadvantage is the three-month waiting period until tubal occlusion is confirmed, the need for a confirmation procedure, and the possible increased risk of more than one surgical procedure. (See <a href=\"#H2759937094\" class=\"local\">'Comparison with other sterilization approaches'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After the procedure, we suggest a hysterosalpingogram or ultrasound by a clinician certified in this evaluation technique rather than a pelvic radiograph to confirm bilateral tubal occlusion. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Confirming occlusion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complications may include pelvic pain, uterine or tubal perforation, expulsion of the device, or pelvic infection. Women with preexisting chronic pain syndromes should be counseled that they may be at increased risk for pelvic pain following tubal micro-insert sterilization. Similarly, women with pre-existing abnormal uterine bleeding may be at increased risk for abnormal uterine bleeding after sterilization. Patients who undergo hysteroscopic sterilization are also at increased risk of future reoperation compared with those who undergo laparoscopic sterilization. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If desired or indicated, there are several ways in which to remove the micro-inserts, including hysteroscopy, laparoscopy, laparotomy, and hysterectomy. The method of removal is chosen based on time since placement, patient comorbidities, and fertility desires. All clinicians who place Essure should be comfortable removing it as well. (See <a href=\"#H175751995\" class=\"local\">'Micro-insert removal'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk of pregnancy after hysteroscopic sterilization is approximately 0.1 percent with the micro-insert in women who undergo successful placement and have confirmation of correct placement at three months (hysteroscopic tubal sterilization). Reasons for failure include pregnancy at the time of insertion, incorrect placement, noncompliance with postoperative instructions, and misreading of imaging study used to confirm bilateral occlusion.
