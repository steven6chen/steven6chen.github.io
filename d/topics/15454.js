Although symptoms of depression are prevalent among primary care patients, few patients discuss these symptoms directly with their primary care clinicians. Instead, two-thirds of primary care patients with depression present with somatic symptoms (eg, headache, back problems, or chronic pain), making detection of depression more difficult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-depression-in-adults/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>In the absence of screening, it is estimated that only 50 percent of patients with major depression are identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-depression-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Unless directly asked about their mood, patients omit information about depressive symptoms for a variety of reasons, including fear of stigmatization, belief that depression falls outside the purview of primary care, belief that depression isn't a &quot;real&quot; illness but rather a personal flaw, concerns about medical record confidentiality, and concerns about being prescribed antidepressant medication or being referred to a psychiatrist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-depression-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Systematic screening carries the potential for substantial benefit. Untreated depression is associated with decreased quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-depression-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], increased risk of suicide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-depression-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], and poor physiological outcomes when depression co-occurs with chronic medical conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-depression-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Compared with non-depressed persons, patients with depression have an increased risk of mortality (relative risk [RR] 1.81) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-depression-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Each year lived with depression has been calculated to detract approximately 20 to 40 percent from a quality-adjusted life year (QALY) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-depression-in-adults/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. Furthermore, depression entails a significant economic burden, accounting for billions of dollars in the United States alone each year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-depression-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The effects of depression extend beyond the individual patient, with negative impact on patients' employers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-depression-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], spouses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-depression-in-adults/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>], and children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-depression-in-adults/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].

Community surveys of adults living in 10 countries (Brazil, Canada, Chile, Czech Republic, Germany, Japan, Mexico, Netherlands, Turkey, and the United States) found that the lifetime prevalence of major depression varied from 3 percent in Japan to 17 percent in the United States, with most rates in the range of 8 to 12 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-depression-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Reasons for the lower prevalence of depression in some countries may reflect true variation in the determinants of depression due to cultural or genetic factors, sample selection biases, and problems with the cross-cultural portability of diagnostic criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-depression-in-adults/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>].

Mood manifestations include sadness, emotional distress, emotional numbness, or sometimes anxiety or irritability. Neurovegetative symptoms include loss of energy, changes in sleep, appetite, or weight. Certain patient populations are more likely to present with somatic symptoms (headache, abdominal or pelvic pain, back pain, or other physical complaints), which can impede the diagnosis of depression. Populations in which somatic symptoms often predominate include pregnant women, older adults, incarcerated individuals, some cultural ethnicities, patients with low incomes, and patients with coexisting medical conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-depression-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Most individuals with depressive syndromes eventually remit, such that approximately half will be in remission after one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-depression-in-adults/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>] and three-quarters after two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-depression-in-adults/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. However, subsyndromal symptoms of depression often persist even after full criteria for depression are no longer met. The most common symptom to persist after remission is insomnia, followed by sad mood and decreased concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-depression-in-adults/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Persistence of such symptoms heightens the risk for recurrence of the full depressive syndrome.

Only two relatively short-term randomized trials have evaluated screening alone without additional supports for the treatment of depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-depression-in-adults/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>].

There is evidence that response rates to treatment are better if treatment is initiated earlier in the course of depression. Screening instruments are available that are relatively easy to administer and have been validated for use in primary care. Less well confirmed, however, is whether screening leads to improved patient outcomes that outweigh the potential harms of false-positive test results and unnecessary treatment.</p><p>Several high-quality systematic reviews address the effects of depression screening in primary care settings for a broad range of clinically relevant outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-depression-in-adults/abstract/49-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">49-52</a>]. A review completed for the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) found that screening in adults, without other practice enhancements to improve depression care, increases the rate of depression diagnosis (absolute increase 10 to 47 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-depression-in-adults/abstract/49,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,53</a>]. A subsequent meta-analysis of 16 studies with 7576 patients found the use of depression screening or case-finding instruments in primary care or other non-mental health settings was associated with a modest increase in clinicians' recognition of depression (relative risk [RR] 1.27, 95% CI 1.02-1.59) and a nonsignificant impact on the initiation of any treatment (RR 1.30; CI 0.97-1.76), with no influence on the prescription of antidepressants (RR 1.20, CI 0.87-1.66) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-depression-in-adults/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. The seven studies that provided data on clinical outcomes, however, found no evidence of an effect on depressive symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-depression-in-adults/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. This suggests that although screening is important for detecting depression, it is insufficient to improve clinical outcomes.</p><p>Other systematic reviews, including the 2009 review for the USPSTF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-depression-in-adults/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>], included studies that evaluated screening in combination with additional staff support for activities, such as symptom monitoring, self-management plans, or facilitated referral [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-depression-in-adults/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. The USPSTF review identified eight randomized controlled trials and found that intervention patients were more likely to show significant improvement in depressive symptoms than control patients (RR 1.78), improvements that persisted for up to five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-depression-in-adults/abstract/51,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,53</a>]. Although the independent contribution of screening in these complex interventions is impossible to determine, these data support the conclusion that depression screening, coupled with appropriate follow-up and effective treatment supported by staff in addition to the primary care clinician, is beneficial. Effective treatment requires careful monitoring of treatment adherence and clinical response together with changes in treatment if the clinical response is poor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-depression-in-adults/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. This is no different from the approach to patients with chronic medical conditions. For example, when a screening blood glucose test reveals diabetes and treatment is initiated, that patient will need subsequent glucose monitoring, titration of therapy, and involvement of a health care team to optimize clinical outcomes.</p><p>The 2016 USPSTF systematic review found one trial in the general adult population that reported no adverse events attributed to screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-depression-in-adults/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. There were no other trials that reported on the potential harms of screening. Potential harms include false-positive diagnoses with subsequent labeling effects and unnecessary treatment, including the medication costs and adverse effects of medication, as well as opportunity costs (time taken from a patient encounter to screen for depression might be spent on other preventive or therapeutic activities). Depression screening is highly accepted, with few patients finding the process burdensome or upsetting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-depression-in-adults/abstract/57-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">57-59</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H265061488\"><span class=\"h2\">Cost-effectiveness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data on the cost-effectiveness of depression screening are limited and come from two sources, simulation approaches and randomized trials of enhanced care models that utilized depression screening to identify patients.

Cost-effectiveness analyses were reported in two of the seven trials included in USPSTF&rsquo;s review of depression screening. Costs per QALY were within the proposed threshold of &le;$50,000 per QALY for interventions considered to be cost-effective, ranging from $9478 to $36,467 per QALY [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-depression-in-adults/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>].</p><p>An evidence synthesis evaluating the cost-effectiveness of depression screening for postnatal depression found no adequate primary data, and a simulation model did not suggest cost-effectiveness using conventional thresholds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-depression-in-adults/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22016477\"><span class=\"h1\">SCREENING OPTIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22016584\"><span class=\"h2\">Targeted versus general population screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One approach, recommended by the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), is to screen all patients during routine visits and then further evaluate those who score above a specified threshold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-depression-in-adults/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].

To facilitate ease of implementation, we support screening at the time of a routine health visit.</p><p>When personnel or systems are available to assure appropriate follow-up and management of patients who screen positive, screening all adults for depression at the time of a routine visit perhaps is the simplest approach, particularly when using an electronic medical record (EMR) that incorporates clinical reminders. Practices may wish to distribute questionnaires at check-in for patients to complete, or have staff distribute or verbally administer questionnaires along with assessment of vital signs. When using the latter approach, many practices find it most efficient to administer the Patient Health Questionnaire-2 (PHQ-2) verbally and, when positive, distribute a longer questionnaire, such as the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), to be completed in the examination room while the patient is waiting for the clinician.</p><p>Use of pre-visit videos or interactive computer programs to engage patients in recognition of depression symptoms has also been explored. In one randomized trial, patients with depressive symptoms who used a tailored interactive computer program in the waiting area prior to their clinician visit were more likely to be treated for depression (by antidepressant prescription <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> referral) than control patients; viewing a noninteractive video did not increase treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-depression-in-adults/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>].

The USPSTF also states that screening should be implemented with adequate systems in place to ensure diagnosis, treatment, and appropriate follow-up. The USPSTF notes that the optimal interval for screening is not known.

In the absence of high-quality evidence of the effectiveness of screening for depression, and with concern about false-positive diagnoses leading to unnecessary treatment, the CTFPHC recommends against routine screening for depression in the primary care setting.
