This disorder was initially called Ormond's disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], but it has also been referred to as periureteritis fibrosa, periureteritis plastica, chronic periureteritis, sclerosing retroperitoneal granuloma, and fibrous retroperitonitis.</p><p>Retroperitoneal fibrosis may be idiopathic or secondary to other causes. Idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis<em> </em>is an immune-mediated disease, which can be either isolated, associated with other autoimmune diseases, or arise in the context of a multifocal fibroinflammatory disorder, named immunoglobulin G4-related disease (IgG4-RD). Although there are no standardized criteria of classification, idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis is actually part of the disease spectrum of chronic periaortitis, a condition characterized by inflammation and fibrosis surrounding the aorta and iliac arteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/1,3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,4</a>]. Chronic periaortitis (CP) includes inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysms and perianeurysmal retroperitoneal fibrosis, two entities that are grouped together because of similar clinical and histologic characteristics, although pathogeneses and epidemiology may differ [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In approximately one-third of patients, CP also involves the thoracic aorta and the epiaortic arteries, suggesting that it is a systemic inflammatory disease of the large arteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>The etiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnostic evaluation of retroperitoneal fibrosis will be reviewed here. The treatment of retroperitoneal fibrosis is presented separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of retroperitoneal fibrosis&quot;</a>). Other causes of urinary tract obstruction and hydronephrosis are also reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-urinary-tract-obstruction-and-hydronephrosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of urinary tract obstruction and hydronephrosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H90857066\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Retroperitoneal fibrosis is a rare disease. In one Finnish study, the incidence of the idiopathic form of the disease was estimated from hospital discharge data to be 0.1 per 100,000 person-years and its prevalence 1.4 per 100,000 inhabitants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, in a subsequent population-based study performed in the Netherlands, the reported annual incidence was approximately 10-fold higher (ie, 1.3 per 100,000 inhabitants per year) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The latter study probably provides a more accurate estimate of the incidence given the complexity of the diagnosis and requirement for prolonged follow-up that would not have been possible in a study of hospital discharge codes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Inflammatory abdominal aortic aneurysms represent 4 to 10 percent of all abdominal aortic aneurysms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. No data are available about the incidence of secondary retroperitoneal fibrosis.</p><p>Idiopathic disease most commonly occurs in individuals 40 to 60 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/5,8,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8,11,12</a>]. Most studies have suggested a 2 to 3:1 male-to-female predominance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/5,8,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8,11,12</a>], although this is not reported in all studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. One study has suggested that chronic periaortitis, which includes idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis, is associated with the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) allele HLA-DRB1*03 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are idiopathic and secondary forms of retroperitoneal fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Idiopathic forms account for over 70 percent of cases and are either immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) or non-IgG4 related [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

This was suggested by a case-control study that matched 90 patients with idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis with 270 control patients of similar age, sex, and geographic region [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Exposure to asbestos was determined via a questionnaire developed and validated by the Italian National Mesothelioma Register [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>] and administered by a blinded occupational medicine specialist.</p><p>The combination of smoking and either occupational or extraoccupational asbestos exposure was associated with multiplicative increases in risk of retroperitoneal fibrosis, with odds ratios (ORs) of 12.04 (95% CI 4.32-38) for occupational asbestos exposure and 8.42 (95% CI 2.77-30.58) for extraoccupational asbestos exposure. Asbestos exposure without smoking was associated with an OR of 4.22 (95% CI 2.14-8.33). Both histories of current smoking and former smoking were associated with ORs of 3.21 (95% CI 1.46-7.07) and 2.93 (95% CI 1.39-6.14), respectively.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1085297711\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Retroperitoneal fibrosis is most likely a manifestation of a systemic autoimmune disease that may arise as a primary aortitis that elicits a periaortic fibroinflammatory response. This hypothesis is supported by the frequent presence of constitutional symptoms, increased concentrations of acute phase reactants, autoantibodies, and known autoimmune diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In addition, the disease often affects other vascular segments (such as the thoracic aorta and mesenteric arteries), which supports the concept that it is a primary systemic inflammatory disease of large arteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis is associated with the allele HLA&#8209;DRB1*03, D32 polymorphism of the gene encoding CCR5, a chemokine receptor, and the TTCCAT haplotype of the gene encoding <span class=\"nowrap\">CCL11/eotaxin&#8209;1</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. <span class=\"nowrap\">CCL11/eotaxin&#8209;1</span> drives the recruitment of eosinophils [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].</p><p>Other potentially pathogenetic processes described in some patients with idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis include the infiltration of immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4)-producing plasma cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/26,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,31</a>].</p><p>The presence of IgG4-producing plasma cells suggests that, in some cases, retroperitoneal fibrosis is a manifestation of IgG4-related disease (IgG4-RD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/26,29,30,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,29,30,32</a>]. IgG4-RD is a multisystem disease characterized by tumor-like swelling of involved organs, a lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate enriched in IgG4-positive plasma cells, and variable degrees of fibrosis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-igg4-related-disease#H179281615\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of IgG4-related disease&quot;, section on 'Retroperitoneal fibrosis and related disorders'</a>). In some cases of IgG4-RD-associated retroperitoneal fibrosis, other manifestations of the disease are present. As an example, in one report, all 14 of the reported cases of IgG4-related retroperitoneal fibrosis exhibited involvement of other organs, including the pancreas (11 patients), salivary glands (three patients), lymph nodes (two patients), and pituitary gland (one patient), and one patient had mediastinal periaortitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. However, cases of isolated IgG4-related retroperitoneal fibrosis have also been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. IgG4-RD is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-igg4-related-disease#H179281615\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of IgG4-related disease&quot;, section on 'Retroperitoneal fibrosis and related disorders'</a>.)</p><p>Although retroperitoneal fibrosis may belong to the spectrum of IgG4-related disease, it is not clear what percentage of retroperitoneal fibrosis patients present with the full phenotype of the disease. Small studies demonstrate no major differences between IgG4-related and unrelated retroperitoneal fibrosis, except for a higher frequency of extraretroperitoneal lesions in the IgG4-related disease subset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial clinical features of idiopathic or secondary retroperitoneal fibrosis are nonspecific, and the diagnosis is often not considered until there is significant organ (most commonly kidney) involvement. Most patients have ureteral obstruction and renal impairment by the time they come to medical attention.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H90857264\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pain in the lower back, abdomen, or flank is the most common presenting symptom among patients with retroperitoneal fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In two of the largest retrospective series, pain was present upon presentation in over 90 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/4,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8</a>]. Pain tends to be dull and poorly localized and is not affected by activity or posture. Patients may describe bilateral or unilateral flank pain that radiates to the inguinal region [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Pain may be acute in onset and similar to renal colic; in one study from North America, the diagnosis of retroperitoneal fibrosis was commonly made by radiographic imaging that was done to exclude acute nephrolithiasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Pain is often relieved better with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents than opiates, probably due to the inflammatory nature of the lesion.</p><p>Pain is often associated with systemic complaints including malaise, anorexia, weight loss, fever, nausea, and vomiting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. In the study cited above, among 48 patients, fatigue and often substantial weight loss were present upon presentation in 29 and 26 patients (60 and 54 percent), respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Other symptoms included anorexia (eight patients), fever (two patients), and testicular pain (four patients).</p><p>Similar findings were noted in another series from the Netherlands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Among 53 patients, lower back, abdominal, flank, and testicular pain were present in 32, 30, 28, and 19 patients, respectively. Weight loss, constipation, nausea <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vomiting, and fever were present in 21, 16, 13, and 9 patients, respectively.</p><p>Testicular pain was noted in more than 50 percent of male patients in one randomized trial of 40 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Stenosis of arteries is rare. Conversely, venous compression (mainly of the inferior vena cava) is common and can cause lower limb edema due to lymphatic compression. Venous involvement progresses slowly and favors the development of collateral circles, although inferior vena cava syndrome, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism are uncommon.</p><p>Patients may describe upper-leg claudication related to arterial compromise of the lower extremities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/1,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8</a>] or symptoms of mesenteric ischemia due to compression of the mesenteric arteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/1,3,12,37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,12,37-39</a>]. When the thoracic aorta <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the epi-aortic arteries are involved, patients may suffer from hoarseness, secondary to recurrent laryngeal nerve paralysis, dry cough, or upper-limb claudication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/1,6,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6,8</a>].</p><p>Ureteral and renal involvement is common in peri-iliac retroperitoneal fibrosis and can cause acute kidney injury (AKI) when there is a bilateral encasement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/1,6,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6,8</a>]. However, many patients present with renal atrophy, probably due to previous transient unilateral obstruction that chronically damages the kidney or due to renal artery stenosis by retroperitoneal fibrosis.</p><p>The urine output may be reduced, normal, or even increased (due to a secondary concentrating defect) in patients with obstructive uropathy. Gross hematuria is uncommon, but urgency, urinary frequency, and dysuria are commonly described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>On physical examination, patients may be hypertensive due to renal artery impingement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/3,12,37-39\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,12,37-39</a>]. In the study from the Netherlands, hypertension was present in 57 percent of patients on presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], and, in the study from North America, new-onset hypertension (which may be more likely to be related to retroperitoneal fibrosis) was present among 33 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Patients may have lower-extremity edema or evidence of thrombophlebitis or deep vein thrombosis resulting from obstruction of the inferior vena cava <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> iliac veins. Lower-extremity edema was present on presentation among 11 of 48 patients (23 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. A hydrocele, which is a collection of peritoneal fluid between the parietal and visceral layers of the tunica vaginalis, is not uncommon among patients with retroperitoneal fibrosis. In the study from the Netherlands, a hydrocele was noted among 29 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], and, in the randomized trial cited above, testicular pain, varicocele, or hydrocele was present in 55 to 58 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Formation of hydroceles and varicoceles is likely related to compression of retroperitoneal vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no hematologic or biochemical abnormalities that are specific for retroperitoneal fibrosis. A variable elevation in the serum blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and creatinine concentration is usually observed, depending upon the presence and extent of obstruction. Among 40 patients with newly diagnosed retroperitoneal fibrosis, 75 percent had evidence of ureteral obstruction, and 47 percent had renal failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In the Netherlands study, impaired renal function (defined as serum creatinine &gt;1.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> was present in 66 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>The urinary sediment is most often normal.</p><p>The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and C-reactive protein (CRP) are elevated in the majority of patients at presentation, reflecting the inflammatory nature of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/8,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,40</a>]. As an example, among 53 patients in the Netherlands study cited above, 74 and 62 percent had an elevated ESR and CRP, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Although high baseline acute phase reactants are associated with a more symptomatic disease, these parameters poorly predict response to therapy, and often they do not increase during disease flares.</p><p>Many patients have anemia, possibly related to renal insufficiency or chronic inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/1,41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,41,42</a>]. Among 48 patients in the series from North America that is cited above, 18 had a hemoglobin concentration &lt;11 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], and normocytic anemia was noted among 64 percent of patients in the Netherlands study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Other less common abnormalities include leukocytosis and eosinophilia. An elevated antinuclear antibody (ANA) may be present in up to 60 percent of the cases, and antibodies against thyroid microsome and thyroglobulin are usually present in cases that are associated with an autoimmune thyroiditis, the most frequent autoimmune disease associated with idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p>A positive antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA) has been described in cases associated with granulomatosis with polyangiitis and microscopic polyangiitis.</p><p>High immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) levels have been linked to IgG4-related retroperitoneal fibrosis, but a systematic assessment of IgG4 in idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis is lacking, as well as the exact proportion of patients with high serum IgG4.</p><p>There are reports of associated monoclonal or polyclonal dysproteinemias.

Extension beyond the sacral promontory and the lack of lobulation are considered benign features to rule out malignancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. As noted above, hydronephrosis is detected on presentation in a significant number of patients. In one randomized trial, 72 to 78 percent of newly diagnosed patients had unilateral or bilateral obstruction diagnosed by radiographic imaging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>There are, however, limitations to the use of ultrasonography. Body habitus, bowel gas, and adjacent bony structures may impair visualization of the fibrotic mass, and only hydronephrosis may be apparent, similar to that seen in any form of obstruction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F77938\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef77938 \">image 4</a>).

The diagnosis is often made by imaging studies, including computed tomography (CT) scan, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, a definitive diagnosis may require a biopsy. It is controversial whether all patients whose CT or MRI suggests retroperitoneal fibrosis require a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis and exclude malignancy as a cause. Many clinicians do not perform a biopsy in patients with a imaging studies demonstrating findings typical of retroperitoneal fibrosis, unless the patient is having surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/1,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3</a>].

The mass is confluent, encasing (but not displacing) the anterior and lateral sides of the aorta, often encircling and compressing the inferior vena cava and causes a medial ureteral deviation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F55419\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef55419 \">image 6</a>).

MRI is to be preferred to CT if the patient has <span class=\"nowrap\">hypersensitivity/allergy</span> to iodinated contrast medium or mild renal function impairment (since gadolinium-containing media are only contraindicated in cases of moderate-to-severe renal failure). Idiopathic retroperitoneal fibrosis on MRI is hypointense in T1-weighted images; in T2-weighted images, its intensity is directly correlated with the disease activity. Diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) features and signal-intensity values at T2-weighted MRI were evaluated for the differential diagnosis of benign retroperitoneal fibrosis and plaque-like retroperitoneal malignant neoplasms. DWI may contribute to clarifying the differential diagnosis of retroperitoneal fibrosis and malignant neoplasms with retroperitoneal fibrosis morphology, although lesions in the malignant group and active retroperitoneal fibrosis group had similar enhancement patterns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p>However, the administration of gadolinium during MRI has been strongly linked to an often severe disease called gadolinium-induced fibrosis among patients with moderate to severe renal disease, particularly those requiring dialysis.

The inflammatory infiltrate consists of B and T lymphocytes, macrophages, and plasma cells and may be diffuse or arranged in pseudo-nodular, perivascular aggregates; rarely, neutrophils are present.
