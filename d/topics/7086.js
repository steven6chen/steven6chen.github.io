Untreated, FPHL results in a slow, progressive decline in the density of scalp hair.</p><p>Multiple therapies have been used for the management of FPHL. Topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minoxidil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">minoxidil</a> is considered the first-line treatment. Data are limited on the efficacy of other agents, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spironolactone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">spironolactone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyproterone-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyproterone acetate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=finasteride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">finasteride</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flutamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flutamide</a>. Hair transplantation surgery is an option for women who have inadequate responses to medical therapy. </p><p>The treatment and prognosis of FPHL will be reviewed here. The pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of FPHL and the diagnosis and management of androgenetic alopecia in men (male pattern hair loss) are discussed separately.

Women may find the loss of hair distressing, and many women who present for the evaluation of FPHL desire treatment.

Photographs are valuable aids for following the response to treatment. </p><p>The response to treatment varies widely. In our experience, not all women who respond to treatment achieve cosmetically significant hair regrowth. In some women, a positive response to treatment manifests only as a reduction in the progression of hair loss. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H633853612\"><span class=\"h1\">FIRST-LINE THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Of the interventions utilized for female pattern hair loss (FPHL), topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minoxidil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">minoxidil</a> has the strongest evidence in support of its efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-pattern-hair-loss-androgenetic-alopecia-in-women-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Topical minoxidil is also a relatively safe treatment.

It is theorized that the drug may prolong the anagen (growth) phase of hair follicles, shorten the telogen (resting) phase, and induce enlargement of miniaturized follicles, thereby contributing to the conversion of miniaturized hairs to terminal hairs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-pattern-hair-loss-androgenetic-alopecia-in-women-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

In addition, the mean increase in hair counts within treated areas was higher in women treated with minoxidil than in women in the placebo groups. A subsequent randomized trial that compared minoxidil 5% foam with placebo also supports the efficacy of minoxidil [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-pattern-hair-loss-androgenetic-alopecia-in-women-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H633853633\"><span class=\"h3\">Product selection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All three formulations of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minoxidil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">minoxidil</a> (2% solution, 5% solution, and 5% foam) are effective for FPHL. Historically, many clinicians recommended use of minoxidil 5% solution or foam based upon a perception of greater efficacy than minoxidil 2% solution; however, data to support this assertion are lacking. In a systematic review of randomized trials evaluating interventions for FPHL, none of the four trials that compared minoxidil 2% with minoxidil 5% found a significant difference in efficacy between the two concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-pattern-hair-loss-androgenetic-alopecia-in-women-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=minoxidil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Minoxidil</a> 5% foam offers drug delivery in a vehicle that may be preferred by some women and is associated with a reduced risk for side effects (eg, scalp pruritus, dandruff, sideburn hypertrichosis) compared with twice daily application of the 2% solution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/female-pattern-hair-loss-androgenetic-alopecia-in-women-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

The patient should massage minoxidil onto the scalp with fingers, and hands should be washed after application. Women should apply the product at least two hours before bed to allow adequate time for drying. This may help to avoid the inadvertent spread of the solution to other body sites during sleeping.</p><p>Treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minoxidil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">minoxidil</a> takes at least four months to exhibit a visible effect.

A variety of topical and systemic therapies have been used for the management of this condition. The response to treatment varies. (See <a href=\"#H633853598\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H633853734\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with FPHL who desire treatment, we suggest topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minoxidil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">minoxidil</a> as first-line therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=4\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2A</a>). At least one year of treatment with minoxidil is required prior to drawing conclusions regarding treatment efficacy. (See <a href=\"#H633853619\" class=\"local\">'Topical minoxidil'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Data are limited on treatments other than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minoxidil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">minoxidil</a> for FPHL. Systemic agents that inhibit androgen action or production, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spironolactone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">spironolactone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyproterone-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyproterone acetate</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=finasteride-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">finasteride</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flutamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flutamide</a>, may be useful in some patients. Further studies are necessary to define which women benefit from these therapies. (See <a href=\"#H633853654\" class=\"local\">'Second-line therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hair transplantation surgery can provide cosmetically favorable results in women with FPHL. Surgical intervention is an option for women who fail to achieve satisfactory improvement with medical therapy. (See <a href=\"#H633853692\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Without treatment, the FPHL typically progresses slowly, though areas of complete baldness similar to those seen in male androgenetic alopecia usually do not occur. Because the response to treatment may be incomplete, initiating treatment early in the course of FPHL is preferred.
