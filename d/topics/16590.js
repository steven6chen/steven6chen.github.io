Among patients with PVE, 40 to 50 percent are treated surgically; surgery is likely warranted but not performed in another 15 to 20 percent due to patient refusal or because surgery is contraindicated by complications of PVE or comorbid conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-for-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Paravalvular invasion is common in PVE (occurring in over 30 percent in one international study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-for-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]), especially when infection arises within 12 months of surgery or involves an aortic prosthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-for-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Among patients who are diagnosed prior to involvement of paravalvular tissue, antibiotic therapy alone may be effective. </p><p>The diagnosis and evaluation of PVE are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of prosthetic valve endocarditis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR SURGERY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Indications for cardiac surgery in patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) have been developed based on complications related to intracardiac pathology and inability to eradicate infection. Some of the indications for surgical treatment are more compelling than others; all require careful individualized risk-benefit analysis.</p><p>We agree with the following recommendations for early valve surgery for patients with PVE from the 2015 American Heart Association (AHA) scientific statement on infective endocarditis (IE) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-for-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>Early surgery (during the initial hospitalization for antimicrobial therapy) is recommended for patients with PVE with one or more of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Signs or symptoms of heart failure resulting from valve dehiscence, intracardiac fistula, or severe prosthetic valve dysfunction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IE complicated by heart block, annular or aortic abscess, or destructive penetrating lesion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PVE caused by fungi or other highly resistant organism. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persistent bacteremia despite appropriate antibiotic therapy for five to seven days and exclusion of other sites of infection.</p><p/><p>As noted in the 2015 AHA scientific statement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-for-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], early surgery may be helpful in some patients in the following clinical setting but evidence is limited. In fact, in the largest study to date, early surgery for conditions other than valve dysfunction and perivalvular abscess was not associated with improved hospital or one-year survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-for-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>] (see <a href=\"#H455399470\" class=\"local\">'Evidence'</a> below). Thus, for patients in the following clinical settings, we suggest basing a decision on whether or not to proceed with surgery upon weighing individualized estimates of benefit and risk:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with PVE who have recurrent emboli despite appropriate antibiotic treatment</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with relapsing PVE</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with PVE with mobile vegetations &gt;10 mm in size</p><p/><p>Similar recommendations are included in the 2015 European Society of Cardiology IE guidelines (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F104582\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104582 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-for-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] and the 2016 American Association for Thoracic Surgery guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-for-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Recommendations for surgery for PVE require continued reassessment as new data emerge. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H455399470\"><span class=\"h1\">EVIDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recommendations for valve surgery in patients with prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) are based upon observational studies that are subject to bias (including treatment selection and survivor bias) and confounding. These limitations are only partially addressed by adjusted analyses. Studies have identified risk factors for mortality among patients with PVE and provide limited data on associations between treatment type (surgery versus only medical therapy) among high-risk groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-for-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Limited evidence suggests that patients with PVE with new (or severe) mitral or aortic regurgitation, perivascular invasion, prosthetic valve dehiscence, or heart failure (HF) are most likely to benefit from surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-for-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/1,3,5,6,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,5,6,8,9</a>].</p><p>A meta-analysis of 32 observational studies of PVE compared 1320 patients who underwent surgical intervention (valve reoperation) with 1316 patients who were treated with medical therapy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-for-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Valve reoperation was associated with a lower risk of 30-day mortality, greater survival at mean 22-month follow-up, and a similar rate of PVE recurrence compared to medical therapy alone. However, the study lacked information on how many patients with indications for surgery were treated medically due to high operative risk and there was no adjustment for risk factors or for time from onset of therapy to surgical intervention. The largest study in this meta-analysis contributed 39.4 percent of the surgically treated population and 43.9 percent of the medically treated group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-for-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Importantly, the unadjusted analysis of survival in this study suggested that surgery provided end of hospitalization and one-year survival benefits; however, when the data were carefully adjusted for potential biases, the early and late survival benefits of surgery were not confirmed. These data, as shown below, call to question the simple conclusion of the meta-analysis and suggest that the decision to intervene surgically in the treatment of PVE is nuanced and requires clinical judgement.</p><p>The largest published study of PVE, an international multicenter prospective study examined 1025 patients with PVE treated between January 2000 and December 2006 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-for-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Of these patients, 490 (48 percent) underwent valve surgery during the initial hospitalization for treatment of PVE. Early surgery was associated with reduced in-hospital and one-year mortality in an unadjusted comparison with medical therapy. However, when outcome was adjusted for the propensity to operate (treatment selection bias) and for time of surgical intervention (survivor bias caused by attributing to medical therapy early deaths in patients who may have had surgical indications), there was no reduction in in-hospital or one-year mortality among surgically treated patients. HF was the strongest predictor of in-hospital and one-year mortality. In a post-hoc subgroup analysis not adjusted for survivor bias, surgery was significantly associated with decreased in-hospital and one-year mortality in the subpopulation with the strongest indications for surgery (new mitral or aortic valve regurgitation, paravalvular abscess or fistula, prosthetic valve dehiscence or severe regurgitation, or HF). However, surgery was not beneficial when the indications for intervention were less strong (mitral or aortic valve vegetations, persistent bacteremia).</p><p>Similar findings were observed in studies with only in-hospital follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-for-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/2,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,11,12</a>]. An international multicenter prospective study of 355 patients with PVE noted the following variables independently associated with surgical therapy: intracardiac abscess, HF, younger age, coagulase-negative staphylococci, and <em>S. aureus</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-for-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Unadjusted in-hospital mortality rates were similar for surgical and medical treatment (25 and 23 percent, respectively). A propensity analysis to compare surgically treated patients with medically treated patients demonstrated a nonsignificant trend toward reduced in-hospital mortality with surgical treatment (odds ratio [OR] 0.51, 95% CI 0.23-1.36). A similar trend was noted among patients with high propensity score for cardiac surgery. In a later study using this international database, in-hospital mortality among 556 patients with PVE was significantly associated with age &ge;65 years, health care-associated infection, stroke, <em>S. aureus</em> infection, persistent bacteremia, HF, and intracardiac abscess [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-for-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The three latter variables are considered indications for surgical treatment, while <em>S. aureus</em> is often accompanied by paravalvular invasion that is an indication for surgical treatment. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Microorganisms usually requiring surgery'</a> below.)</p><p>Antibiotic therapy alone is often successful in patients with PVE who have no evidence of HF, significant prosthetic valve dysfunction, or paravalvular infection and who are infected by less virulent organisms. These patients are characterized by later onset of infection (more than 12 months after prosthesis implantation) and infection by viridans streptococci, HACEK, or enterococci (that can be treated with bactericidal therapy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-for-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. </p><p>These observations illustrate substantial mortality risks among patients with PVE with or without surgical therapy, which may reflect the age and burden of comorbidities in this population as well as the severity of complications from endocarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-for-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/3,8,13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8,13-16</a>]. The studies also indicate that identifying patients with PVE who will benefit from cardiac surgery during active infection is more complex than previously recognized. Recommended indications for cardiac surgery are not absolute and should be weighed carefully in decision making, together with the patient&rsquo;s overall clinical condition and estimated surgical risk. Survival benefit from surgery may be limited to those patients with the most severe and demanding complications of infection: paravalvular invasion (eg, abscess) and HF from valve dysfunction or dehiscence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-for-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/1,3,5,6,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,5,6,8,9</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H101486198\"><span class=\"h2\">Heart failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Observational data suggest that the outcome of PVE in patients who experience HF due to prosthetic valve dysfunction is improved with valve surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-for-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/3,12,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,12,17</a>]. Among patients with moderate to severe HF and PVE, few survive beyond six months if treated with antibiotics alone, whereas 44 to 64 percent survive with timely surgical intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-for-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/14,18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,18-21</a>]. Surgery must be performed before HF becomes intractable. There is no evidence that delaying surgery in this setting improves outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-for-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. In fact, the operative mortality of these patients is proportional to the severity of hemodynamic disability at the time of surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-for-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/22,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,25</a>]. Thus, hemodynamic status should weigh more heavily than the duration of antibiotic therapy in determining the timing of surgical intervention.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H101784564\"><span class=\"h2\">Paravalvular invasion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with PVE complicated by paravalvular invasion (evidenced by development of complete atrioventricular block, annular or aortic abscess, aortic aneurysm or pseudoaneurysm, fistula formation, or other destructive penetrating lesion) experience high mortality rates and are rarely curable with medical treatment alone. Complex reconstructive procedures have been associated with survival rates of 80 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-for-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. Patients with these complications are among those most likely to benefit from cardiac surgery and there is generally no benefit from delay of surgery.</p><p>Prosthetic valve dehiscence is also an indication of paravalvular invasion. An unstable, hypermobile prosthesis due to dehiscence of anchoring sutures causing HF <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> severe valve regurgitation is a surgical emergency, requiring urgent intervention, because the valve is likely to become increasingly unstable with acute severe valve regurgitation. The management of lesser degrees of dehiscence is very nuanced. First, it must be clear that the dehiscence is new and related to PVE rather than a long-standing residual of the original surgery. If minimal dehiscence is related to PVE, the interplay of mortality related to surgery versus that related to inadequate treatment of PVE must be assessed. In some patients with minimal dehiscence, serial monitoring during antibiotic therapy rather than early surgery may be preferred. </p><p>Identification of evidence of paravalvular invasion (including use of transesophageal echocardiography) is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-adults-with-suspected-native-valve-endocarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and evaluation of adults with suspected native valve endocarditis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-and-outcome-of-infective-endocarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications and outcome of infective endocarditis&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Microorganisms usually requiring surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgery is generally advised for PVE caused by <em>S. aureus</em> when accompanied by intracardiac complications and also for fungi, gram-negative (non-HACEK) microorganisms (particularly <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> and multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli), and multidrug-resistant enterococci.</p><p><em>S. aureus</em> PVE is associated with significant mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-for-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/28-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-33</a>]. Although earlier guidelines included <em>S. aureus</em> PVE as an indication for early surgery, the current indications are based upon presence of specific complications of PVE rather than infection with <em>S. aureus</em>. This approach is supported by a study of 168 patients with definite <em>S. aureus</em> PVE; after adjusting for selection bias (propensity for surgery), prognostic metrics, and survivor bias (time of surgery), surgical treatment conveyed no benefit for in-hospital or one-year mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-for-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. While subject to the limitations of a retrospective review of prospectively collected data and not from a randomized trial, these observations suggest that the decision for surgical therapy of <em>S. aureus</em> PVE is more complex than previously thought. Surgical intervention is likely to be useful in those patients with major intracardiac complications and marked hemodynamic dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-for-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/1,9,18,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9,18,31,32</a>]. Selected patients with <em>S. aureus</em> PVE can be effectively treated with antibiotics alone. In a study of 55 patients with <em>S. aureus</em> PVE, patients who were cured without surgical intervention were characterized by age less than 50 years old, American Society of Anesthesia class III status, and the absence of cardiac, central nervous system, or systemic complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-for-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. When attempting medical therapy in patients with <em>S. aureus</em> PVE, careful follow-up is required to monitor for development of intracardiac complications requiring surgical intervention.</p><p>Early surgical intervention is considered by most experts to be a standard element of treatment for fungal PVE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-for-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Among 15 patients with fungal PVE treated with antifungal agents plus surgery, 10 (67 percent) survived with an average follow-up of 4.5 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-for-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. One review of 17 patients suggested that survival rates for <em>Candida</em> PVE were comparable with and without surgery (46 versus 50 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-for-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. However, only patients with uncomplicated PVE survived in this review, and many remained on long-term suppressive oral therapy. Patients who have fungal PVE often have significant comorbidities (such as end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis or immunosuppressed states from chemotherapy or HIV, for example). Timing and duration of medical therapy and surgical intervention are frequently complex.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3554823\"><span class=\"h2\">Embolization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The role of surgery in patients with PVE and recurrent emboli or large mobile vegetation(s) has not been clearly established. The frequency of embolic complications is higher in patients with native valve endocarditis (NVE) who have vegetations exceeding 10 mm in diameter and hypermobile compared with those with smaller, less mobile vegetations. Comparable data are not available for patients with PVE. However, the overall rate of embolic complications is similar for patients with PVE and NVE and, in both conditions, emboli decrease with effective therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-for-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. While prevention of emboli that cause irreversible end-organ damage (eg, central nervous system and myocardial infarction) is a laudable goal, it has not been established that surgical intervention achieves this aim in patients with PVE and large vegetations in the absence of other complications. The risk of emboli should be weighed with other conditions that might benefit from surgical intervention. In this setting, surgery should be weighed carefully.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H101784710\"><span class=\"h2\">Relapse after optimal medical therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PVE relapses after appropriate antimicrobial therapy may reflect unrecognized paravalvular infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-for-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/4,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,18</a>] and thus merit careful re-evaluation, including imaging to assess for new evidence of paravalvular complications (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-evaluation-of-adults-with-suspected-native-valve-endocarditis#H1631205489\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and evaluation of adults with suspected native valve endocarditis&quot;, section on 'Cardiac imaging'</a>). The benefit of surgery versus additional enhanced antibiotic therapy must be weighed carefully.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">ANTIBIOTIC THERAPY FOLLOWING SURGERY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following valve replacement for active bacterial endocarditis, the Task Force on Infective Endocarditis of the European Society of Cardiology recommends another full course (six weeks) of antimicrobial treatment if the intraoperative valve culture is positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-for-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. We agree with this approach for culture-positive settings and when an acute necrotizing process is found at surgery. If the culture is negative and pathology does not reveal acute necrotizing infection, we suggest completion of at least the full treatment course (counting the duration of preoperative antibiotics). We favor longer courses of postoperative antibiotic therapy when the new prosthetic valve has been placed at a site where there was overt paravalvular infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">ANTICOAGULATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among patients with prosthetic valve infective endocarditis, the potential benefit of preventing embolization with anticoagulation must be weighed against the increased risk of intracerebral hemorrhage. This issue is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antithrombotic-therapy-in-patients-with-infective-endocarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antithrombotic therapy in patients with infective endocarditis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4520945\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS AND OUTCOMES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complications following surgery for prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) reflect the risks of redo surgical valve replacement in the setting of infection frequently associated with paravalvular tissue invasion. Major complications include severe coagulopathy, bleeding or tamponade requiring re-exploration of the chest, acute renal failure, low cardiac output syndrome, complete atrioventricular block, respiratory failure requiring prolonged ventilatory support, stroke, sepsis, recrudescent PVE and prosthetic valve dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-for-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In the hands of experienced cardiac surgeons, operative mortality rates for patients with paravalvular infection due to PVE, treated with valve replacement and surgical reconstruction of paravalvular tissue, range from 10 to 30 percent; in contrast, the projected mortality would approach 100 percent without surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-for-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/1,26,27,40-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,26,27,40-43</a>]. These data suggest that surgical intervention for PVE complicated by extensive invasion and tissue disruption should be performed in centers with extensive experience when possible. Complex reconstruction of the aortic or mitral valve apparatus and the supporting structures is often required to achieve an optimal outcome of PVE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-for-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/27,40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,40-42</a>]. Among patients with PVE, factors associated with increased mortality during initial hospitalization and at one year following infection include increased age, health care-associated infection, <em>Staphylococcus aureus </em>infection, persistent bacteremia, vegetation, intracardiac abscess, valve dehiscence or severe regurgitation, heart failure, and stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-for-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/2-4,12,18,19,44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4,12,18,19,44,45</a>]. </p><p>Five-year survival rates ranging from 54 to 82 percent have been reported for patients undergoing surgery for PVE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-for-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/22,27,40,42,46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,27,40,42,46,47</a>].</p><p>The rate of recrudescent PVE after surgery is 6 to 15 percent; repeat surgery is required for recurrent PVE or for dysfunction of the newly implanted prosthesis in 18 to 26 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgery-for-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/4,22,26,27,40,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,22,26,27,40,43</a>]. While the frequencies of these complications are not insignificant, they are relatively small compared with the anticipated mortality with antibiotic therapy alone. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3555128\"><span class=\"h1\">TRANSCATHETER HEART VALVES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endocarditis has been described in patients with transcatheter aortic or pulmonic heart valves (THV), as discussed separately. The mortality risk associated with THV-prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) is high. For transcatheter aortic valves, thus far, data suggest that considerations similar to those operative in the treatment of surgically placed aortic valve PVE may be reasonable for patients with transcatheter aortic valve replacement-associated PVE, including careful <span class=\"nowrap\">risk/benefit</span> analysis. Management of transcatheter pulmonic valve endocarditis is discussed separately.

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Paravalvular abscess is common in PVE, especially when infection arises within 12 months of surgery or involves an aortic prosthesis. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'General concepts'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indications for cardiac surgery in patients with PVE have been developed based on complications related to intracardiac pathology and inability to eradicate infection. Decisions on whether to proceed with surgical treatment of PVE require careful individualized risk-benefit analysis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early surgery is recommended for patients with PVE with one or more of the following:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Signs or symptoms of heart failure (HF) resulting from valve dehiscence, intracardiac fistula, or severe prosthetic valve dysfunction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>IE complicated by heart block, annular or aortic abscess, or destructive penetrating lesion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Infection with a highly resistant organism (including fungi).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Persistent bacteremia despite appropriate antibiotic therapy for five to seven days and exclusion of other sites of infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early surgery may be helpful in some patients in the following clinical setting but evidence is limited. Thus for patients in the following clinical settings, we suggest basing a decision on whether or not to proceed with surgery upon weighing individualized estimates of benefit and risk:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with PVE who have recurrent emboli despite appropriate antibiotic treatment</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with relapsing PVE</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with PVE with mobile vegetations &gt;10 mm</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Observational data indicate that the outcome of PVE in patients who experience severe HF due to prosthesis dysfunction or who have evidence of valve dehiscence, paravalvular abscess, or fistula formation is improved with surgical treatment. There is no evidence that delaying surgery in the setting of deteriorating cardiac function improves outcome. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery is generally advised for PVE caused by <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> when accompanied by intracardiac complications and also for fungi, gram-negative (non-HACEK) microorganisms (particularly <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em> and multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacilli), and multidrug-resistant enterococci. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Microorganisms usually requiring surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the hands of experienced cardiac surgeons, operative mortality rates for patients with PVE treated with valve replacement and surgical reconstruction of paravalvular tissue range from 10 to 30 percent. The projected mortality for patients with PVE with severe paravalvular invasion or HF due to prosthetic valve dysfunction approaches 100 percent without surgery. The rate of recurrent PVE after surgery is 6 to 15 percent. (See <a href=\"#H4520945\" class=\"local\">'Complications and outcomes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4618727\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The UpToDate editorial staff would like to thank Dr. Gabriel S.
