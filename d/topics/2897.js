Beginning early in the 21<sup>st </sup>century, there has also been an expansion in the indications for cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIED, a term which includes PPMs and ICDs), and device therapy has become more complex, frequently involving multiple leads per patient. As such, there are occasions when it is necessary to remove a device and any associated leads. </p><p>The most common indications for lead removal are infection, venous occlusion, advisory or recall as a result of (potential) lead malfunction, or mechanical lead failure. Lead management involves the assessment of risks and benefits of whether or not to remove the lead based on the individual clinical condition of the patient as well as lead characteristics.</p><p>This topic will discuss the indications for lead removal, lead removal procedure requirements, outcomes, and potential complications of lead removal. A more comprehensive discussion of CIED infection, complications of CIED implantation, and device malfunction is found separately.

As a result of the complex nature of these cases, recommendations for lead removal apply only to those patients in whom the benefits outweigh the risks when assessed on individual patient factors and operator specific experience and outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-device-lead-removal/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2425159213\"><span class=\"h2\">Infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infections, which can result in CIED device and lead removal, can generally be grouped into two major categories (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infections-involving-cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infections involving cardiac implantable electronic devices&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pocket infection <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> device associated endocarditis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bacteremia without an alternative source (particularly Staph aureus) or bacteremia which persists or recurs despite appropriate antimicrobial therapy</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3729624\"><span class=\"h3\">Pocket infection and/or device-associated endocarditis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lead removal (along with device removal) is indicated in persons with infection that directly involves any part of the cardiac implantable electronic device (CIED) system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-device-lead-removal/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Two studies that span the years of 1990 through 2003 reveal concerning rises in rates of infections that parallel and even exceed the rates of device implantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-device-lead-removal/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. The possible reasons for this increase are a result of higher infection rates in generator changes (than in initial implants) and the likely overall poorer health of the patients who are being implanted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-device-lead-removal/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Untreated device-related infection is associated with mortality rates ranging from 31 to 66 percent, a rate that is two to threefold higher than the mortality seen in patients treated with device system extraction and antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-device-lead-removal/abstract/8-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-13</a>]. In most situations, eradication of CIED infection requires complete removal of the entire system (ie, all hardware including the generator and leads).</p><p>The device along with the leads should be removed whenever there is evidence of pocket infection with or without associated bacteremia, or lead infection, which is essentially synonymous with device-related endocarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-device-lead-removal/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Device-related endocarditis is a particularly strong indication for CIED device and lead removal since failure to remove an infected lead is associated with a high rate of relapsed infection and mortality even with a full course of appropriate antibiotic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-device-lead-removal/abstract/8,9,14-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9,14-19</a>]. Pocket infections, however, also require CIED device and lead explantation, even without evidence of deeper infection, as in most cases the risks of recurrent infection outweigh the risks of extraction.</p><p>In a retrospective single-center study of all consecutive cases of CIED infections between 1991 and 2008 (416 patients), device removal complications were associated with increased mortality at 30 days (hazard ratio [HR] 4.33, 95% CI 1.47-12.70) and at one year (HR 3.77, 95% CI 1.88-7.55) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-device-lead-removal/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. However, when compared with the group of patients treated initially with antimicrobial therapy with either delayed device removal or no device removal, immediate device removal was associated with a threefold decrease in one-year mortality (HR 0.35, 95% CI 0.16-0.75). In multivariate analysis, antimicrobial therapy without device removal was associated with a significant increase in 30-day mortality (HR 6.97, 95% CI 1.36-35.60). (See <a href=\"#H991790\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below.)</p><p>Although system infection is the strongest indication for lead removal, each clinical case must be evaluated based on individual comorbidities and long-term outcomes. There are occasional situations (eg, critically ill patients, patients with an overall poor prognosis or limited life expectancy) where chronic suppression with antibiotics is favored rather than CIED extraction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-device-lead-removal/abstract/2,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,21</a>]. </p><p>In cases of pocket infection without bacteremia or endocarditis, lead retention may be considered in patients in whom severe comorbidities or extenuating circumstances exist (eg, extreme frailty) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-device-lead-removal/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Even some patients with lead infection or endocarditis are occasionally managed without device and lead explantation. These are usually extremely frail patients with limited life expectancy or patients refusing device removal. In such cases, however, long-term oral suppressive antibiotics are usually the alternative to lead removal. These patients are, however, at high risk of failure with relapse and increased mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-device-lead-removal/abstract/3,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3729675\"><span class=\"h4\">Recommendations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following recommendations apply to patients with documented pocket infection <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> device-associated endocarditis:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend lead removal in the case of documented CIED system infection, as evidenced by [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-device-lead-removal/abstract/3,4,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,23,24</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Valvular or lead-associated endocarditis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pocket infection as evidenced by pocket abscess</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Device erosion through the skin</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Skin adherence (pre-erosion)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Chronically-draining <span class=\"nowrap\">sinus/fistula</span> from the pocket to the skin</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest lead removal in patients with valvular endocarditis, even without definite involvement of the lead(s) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> device. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lead removal is not necessary if there is only a superficial or incisional infection without involvement of the device or leads [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-device-lead-removal/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3729733\"><span class=\"h3\">Bacteremia without obvious CIED device infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Not all patients with an implanted cardiac device who develop bacteremia end up with infection involving their device.

Such patients may be treated with antibiotics for the bacteremic disease and then observed for relapse. Subsequent unexplained relapse suggests device infection and a need to extract the system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-device-lead-removal/abstract/3,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,25,26</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with superficial cellulitis at the incision in whom the infection does not appear to extend into the generator pocket may be treated without device removal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-device-lead-removal/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, this distinction is often difficult to make, and patients managed with device retention require close observation. In general, device retention is usually reserved for patients in whom device removal poses significant risks (eg, patients with major comorbidities, long standing devices, or who require continuous pacemaker support). Aggressive antibiotic therapy should be administered with this approach. If there is evidence of recurrent, persistent, or progressive infection despite appropriate intravenous antibiotic therapy, the system should be removed.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2425159595\"><span class=\"h2\">Thrombosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Upper extremity venous thrombosis in and of itself is not an indication for lead removal. Several clinical studies have revealed that venous stenoses and occlusion following endovascular pacing and defibrillator lead placement is a common occurrence and is frequently asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-device-lead-removal/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. However, there are situations in which the thrombosis may cause limiting symptoms, the most concerning, albeit least common, being superior vena cava syndrome. If the patient is to undergo stent deployment as treatment, lead removal should be performed prior to stent placement to avoid entrapment of the lead between the stent and the vessel wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-device-lead-removal/abstract/30-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-35</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=malignancy-related-superior-vena-cava-syndrome#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Malignancy-related superior vena cava syndrome&quot;, section on 'Endovenous stenting'</a>.)</p><p>The other more common circumstance in which venous occlusion would be an indication for lead removal is when the occlusion does not allow <span class=\"nowrap\">placement/upgrade</span> of a device. There are also some situations (eg, a contralateral AV fistula, shunt, vascular access port or mastectomy) in which proceeding with a contralateral CIED implant is not advised.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2425159602\"><span class=\"h2\">Malfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lead removal should be performed in patients with leads that, due to their design or their failure, may pose an immediate threat to the patients if left in place. Such a threat might include failure of a pacemaker to properly pace in a pacemaker-dependent patient or the delivery of inappropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shocks. A more detailed discussion regarding lead failure is presented elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-implantable-electronic-devices-long-term-complications#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac implantable electronic devices: Long-term complications&quot;, section on 'Lead failure'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2425159623\"><span class=\"h2\">Advisory/recall</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Decision-making in response to an advisory is extraordinarily complex as the data to assess the risk-benefit ratio are often not readily available and are outside the scope of this discussion. Nonetheless, when the response to an advisory or recall results in lead removal, then we can learn from the resultant treatment. Data accumulated following several prominent advisories and recalls of CIED leads have provided valuable information for clinicians:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Telectronics Accufix pacing leads were recalled in November 1994 after two deaths and two nonfatal injuries were reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-device-lead-removal/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. In a report from a multicenter study and worldwide registry of extraction of the Telectronics Accufix atrial &quot;J&quot; lead from a total of 4023 patients, major complication rates were approximately 3 and 4 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-device-lead-removal/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The mortality rates, resulting primarily from central venous tear or myocardial perforation, were 0.2 and 0.4 percent, respectively.

In a retrospective, multicenter review of 3169 patients with Sprint Fidelis leads, the reported failure rates (failure defined as a sudden rise in impedance or inappropriate shocks) were 5, 11, and 17 percent at three, four, and five years post-implantation, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-device-lead-removal/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Predictors of higher risk of lead failure were female sex, axillary or subclavian venous access, and previous lead failure.<br/><br/>The clinician response to this has been variable, with some only removing leads that demonstrate malfunction, while others have prophylactically removed the lead even without evidence of malfunction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In one report from the Canadian Heart Rhythm Society Device Advisory Committee, which reviewed 248 cases of lead removal versus 220 cases of lead abandonment as a result of the Sprint Fidelis advisory, the overall risk of complications was significantly greater in those who underwent lead removal at the time of revision than in those whose leads were abandoned (19.8 versus 8.6 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-device-lead-removal/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

The decision to pursue conservative monitoring versus lead extraction in this situation is challenging and multifactorial without any firm evidence to guide the decision. In the cases in which lead extraction was pursued and cable externalization was noted, laser sheaths were used more frequently (71 versus 55 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-device-lead-removal/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p/><p>Advanced techniques such as tying suture to each conductor cable or the use of outer sheaths reflect the increased complexity of these cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-device-lead-removal/abstract/42,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,43</a>].</p><p>The decision to remove an apparently normally-functioning lead or leads in response to a manufacturer's or regulatory body's recall or warning is complex and should be performed in close consultation with an electrophysiologist with consideration for the patient's overall clinical status.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2425159630\"><span class=\"h2\">Lead upgrade or abandonment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>On occasion, previously placed leads may be capped and abandoned during CIED upgrade.

Knowledge of the patient's comorbidities, prior <span class=\"nowrap\">invasive/surgical</span> history (eg, prior cardiac surgery or presence of an inferior vena cava filter), and lead characteristics such as lead length, diameter, and adapter information are required. The need for pacemaker support (ie, in a pacemaker-dependent patient) and ongoing device therapy must be assessed. </p><p>Extraction of leads is technically more challenging than generator removal and carries a risk of vascular <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cardiac injury. This risk is largely due to the fibrous connections that develop between the leads and the vascular wall and endocardial surface. As the lead is separated from adhesions to veins and endocardial surfaces, these structures can tear. Due to the risk of endovascular injury, we recommend that lead extraction be undertaken in centers with experience and appropriate facilities including back-up cardiothoracic surgery on site.</p><p>The connections between the lead and endovascular structures can be more substantial with ICD leads than pacemaker leads. ICD leads are larger and have additional components (coils) that provide a greater surface area for adherence.</p><p>Adhesions between endovascular structures and leads become stronger over time. Leads that have been in place less than one to two years can usually be extracted with relatively low risk. Leads in place for greater periods of time become progressively more difficult to extract with a higher risk of endovascular injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-device-lead-removal/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3463013\"><span class=\"h2\">Techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are a variety of techniques for lead removal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-device-lead-removal/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Direct (manual) traction &ndash; A stylet is inserted into the hollow center of the lead, extending close to the distal electrode. A stylet designed for lead extraction locks into place, providing support and allowing the application of direct traction to remove the lead. Leads that are isodiametric (the same diameter along the length of the lead) and less than one year old can potentially be removed by manual traction alone.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Telescoping sheaths &ndash; Specially designed sheaths extend over the lead, dissecting it away from the vascular wall and endocardium.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excimer laser sheaths &ndash; The laser in these sheaths dissolves, rather than tears, the fibrous attachments of the electrodes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical removal &ndash; Cardiotomy with surgical removal is usually reserved for cases in which transcutaneous approaches have failed. In some patients with large vegetations attached to the lead (eg, &gt;2.5 cm), surgical removal may be the preferred initial approach in order to minimize the risk of pulmonary embolism. Reports suggest that percutaneous removal even in the setting of large vegetations can be accomplished without clinically significant pulmonary embolism.

In patients with extensive fibrosis around the electrode tip or along the length of the lead within the vasculature, lead removal becomes a more complex procedure because it requires freeing the lead from sites of adherence to the myocardium and venous endothelium. Early techniques involved manual traction that was often unsuccessful for chronically implanted leads and carried a high risk of myocardial avulsion, cardiac tamponade, and death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-device-lead-removal/abstract/48-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-50</a>]. </p><p>Lead removal tools have been developed to offer countertraction in order to improve the success of the procedure. The contemporary array of equipment includes locking stylets, non-powered &quot;mechanical&quot; sheaths, radiofrequency powered sheaths (electrosurgical unit), excimer laser powered sheaths, and a rotational cutting blade sheath [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-device-lead-removal/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Sheaths operate with simple, manual mechanical action (non-powered) or additional power (as noted above) and may be used alone or within a second sheath as a telescoping system. The aim of powered sheaths is to advance along the lead with reduced traction and counterpressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-device-lead-removal/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. These tools are used to break fibrous adhesions along the course of the lead so that the lead may be removed, usually with no or minimal damage to the vein or myocardium. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2425159653\"><span class=\"h2\">Operator experience</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lead extraction should be performed by trained and experienced clinician staff using specialized equipment and only following appropriate patient preparation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiac-implantable-electronic-device-lead-removal/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].

However, a significant inverse association was noted between center volume and rate of minor complications, with centers performing &lt;15 lead extractions annually having significantly higher minor complication rates (7.2 percent versus 2.1 percent in hospital performing &gt;30 extractions per year).

Because of the potential for serious complications, personnel and resources to perform emergency thoracotomy and cardiopulmonary bypass should be in place.

In general, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) leads are more challenging to remove than pacemaker leads as a result of the presence of coils, which tend to be more adherent to vasculature and myocardium.

(See <a href=\"#H3729733\" class=\"local\">'Bacteremia without obvious CIED device infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Due to the risk of endovascular injury, we recommend that lead extraction procedures be performed with thoracic surgery backup available. (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2425159238\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2425159645\" class=\"local\">'Lead removal procedure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Upper extremity venous thrombosis, in and of itself, is not an indication for lead removal. However, there are situations in which the thrombosis may cause limiting symptoms, the most concerning, albeit least common, being superior vena cava syndrome. If the patient is to undergo stent deployment as treatment, lead removal should be performed prior to stent placement so as to avoid entrapment of the lead between the stent and the vessel wall. (See <a href=\"#H2425159595\" class=\"local\">'Thrombosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lead removal should be performed in patients with leads that, due to their design or their failure, may pose an immediate threat to the patients if left in place. Such a threat might include failure of a pacemaker to properly pace in a pacemaker-dependent patient or the delivery of inappropriate implantable cardioverter-defibrillator shocks. (See <a href=\"#H2425159602\" class=\"local\">'Malfunction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The decision to remove an apparently normally-functioning lead or leads in response to a manufacturer's or regulatory body's recall or warning is complex and should be performed in close consultation with an electrophysiologist, with consideration for the patient's overall clinical status. (See <a href=\"#H2425159623\" class=\"local\">'Advisory/recall'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>On occasion, previously placed leads may be capped and abandoned during CIED upgrade. Abandoned leads, however, pose a risk of interference with the placement or operation of another CIED and may need to be removed. In the absence of contraindications, we suggest removal of abandoned leads at the time of an indicated CIED procedure if implantation of the new device would result in greater than four unilateral leads or greater than five leads through the superior vena cava (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2425159630\" class=\"local\">'Lead upgrade or abandonment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relative contraindications to percutaneous transvenous lead removal include the presence of calcification (visible by radiography) involving the lead in the atrium or superior vena cava, unavailability of required personnel or equipment, the patient not being a candidate for emergency thoracotomy, or anomalous lead placement. (See <a href=\"#H2425159638\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lead removal is generally a complex procedure that requires a significant amount of advance preparation. Knowledge of the patient's comorbidities, prior <span class=\"nowrap\">invasive/surgical</span> history (eg, prior cardiac surgery or presence of an inferior vena cava filter), and lead characteristics such as lead length, diameter, and adapter information are required. The need for pacemaker support (ie, in a pacemaker-dependent patient) and ongoing device therapy must be assessed. (See <a href=\"#H2425159645\" class=\"local\">'Lead removal procedure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are a variety of techniques and equipment used for lead removal, including direct (manual) traction, locking stylets, non-powered &quot;mechanical&quot; sheaths, radiofrequency powered sheaths (electrosurgical unit), excimer laser powered sheaths, and a rotational cutting blade sheath. (See <a href=\"#H3463013\" class=\"local\">'Techniques'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Success rates for lead removal are variable and often reported in terms of complete versus partial removal. Large series of patients who have undergone lead extraction have reported high success rates (95 to 99 percent) and low complication rates (&lt;1 percent), although the results of individual studies, which often reflect the outcomes of experienced operators with high volumes in <span class=\"nowrap\">tertiary/quaternary</span> care centers, are not generalizable to all settings.
