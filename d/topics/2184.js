This disease has a lengthy history; the first investigation of botulism occurred in the 1820s with a case series about hundreds of patients with &quot;sausage poisoning&quot; in a southern German town [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulism/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Several decades later in Belgium, the association was demonstrated between a neuromuscular paralysis and ham infected by a spore-forming bacillus that was isolated from the ham. The organism was named <em>Bacillus botulinus </em>after the Latin word for sausage, botulus.</p><p>The microbiology, pathogenesis, epidemiology, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of botulism will be discussed here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11649389\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF BOTULISM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The modern syndrome of botulism occurs in several forms, differentiated by the mode of acquisition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulism/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Foodborne botulism &ndash; Ingestion of food contaminated by preformed botulinum toxin</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infant botulism &ndash; The ingestion of clostridial spores that then colonize the host's gastrointestinal (GI) tract and release toxin produced in vivo</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wound botulism &ndash; Infection of a wound by <em>Clostridium botulinum</em> with subsequent in vivo production of neurotoxin</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adult enteric infectious botulism or adult infectious botulism of unknown source &ndash; Similar to infant botulism in that toxin is produced in vivo in the GI tract of an infected adult host</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inhalational botulism &ndash; The form that would occur if aerosolized toxin was released in an act of bioterrorism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulism/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Iatrogenic botulism &ndash; Iatrogenic cases of botulism have been reported rarely in patients who have received botulinum toxin for cosmetic indications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulism/abstract/3,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5</a>]</p><p/><p>Bioterrorism agents and the adverse effects of botulinum toxin for cosmetic use are discussed in detail separately.

They are ubiquitous and are easily isolated from the surfaces of vegetables, fruits, seafood, and exist in soil and marine sediment worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulism/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Eight strains of <em>C. botulinum</em> have been distinguished based upon the antigenic specificities of their toxins (a single strain almost always produces only one toxin type).</p><p>The spores of <em>C. botulinum</em> are heat resistant, easily surviving 100&ordm;C at one atmosphere for five or more hours. However, spores can be destroyed by heating to 120&ordm;C for five minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulism/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. When appropriate environmental conditions are present, the spores will germinate and grow into toxin-producing bacilli. These environmental parameters include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Restricted oxygen exposure (either an anaerobic or semi-anaerobic environment)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low acidity (pH &gt;4.6) water</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A temperature of 25 to 37&ordm;C for ideal growth; however, some strains may grow in temperatures as low as 4&ordm;C.</p><p/><p>Some strains (A and B) produce proteolytic enzymes that denature and &quot;spoil&quot; the foods they inhabit, leaving them with an unpleasant appearance, taste, or smell. Other strains do not overtly change the food and, thus, contamination cannot reliably be suspected on the basis of the look, odor, or taste of the food.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Eight distinct <em>C. botulinum</em> toxin types have been described: A through H. Of these eight, types A, B, E, and rarely F, G, and H cause human disease, whereas C and D cause disease in animals such as cattle, ducks, and chickens. <em>C. botulinum</em> toxin type H was first reported in 2014 and is the first new botulinum toxin type to be recognized in over four decades [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulism/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. <em>Clostridium butyricum</em> and <em>Clostridium barati </em>are two other distinct Clostridia species that are known to have produced botulinum type E and F toxins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulism/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In contrast with the spores, the toxin is a heat-labile polypeptide readily denatured by heating above 80&ordm;C. The polypeptide toxin is composed of a light and heavy chain with a combined molecular weight of 150 to 165 kDa.</p><p>Botulinum toxin is released as a single precursor polypeptide chain that is then cleaved by bacterial proteases into a fully active neurotoxin composed of a 50 kDa light chain and a 100 kDa heavy chain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulism/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Although the precise molecular mechanism of botulinum neurotoxin action is not fully understood, a growing body of evidence supports a multistep process including binding of the neurotoxin to specific receptors at the presynaptic nerve terminal, toxin internalization into the nerve cell with translocation across the endosomal membrane, and intracellular endopeptidase activity against proteins necessary for neurotransmitter release.</p><p>Botulinum neurotoxin can target multiple tissues including motor and sensory neurons and can block the cholinergic neuromuscular innervation of striated and smooth muscles as well as the cholinergic innervation of the tear, salivary, and sweat glands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulism/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Botulinum toxin can affect both excitatory and inhibitory synapses but is more active in excitatory neurons. It has been demonstrated to inhibit the release of multiple compounds including dopamine, serotonin, somatostatin, noradrenaline, and gamma aminobutyric acid. Because of its large size, it would be difficult for the neurotoxin to pass through the blood-brain barrier; however, evidence is mounting that it could reach the central nervous system through either systemic spread or axonal retrograde or antegrade transport.</p><p>Botulinum toxin is the most potent bacterial toxin and perhaps the most potent known poison. The minimum lethal dose in experimental mice (MLD) of botulinum toxin is 0.0003 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span>. By comparison, the MLDs for curare and sodium cyanide are 500 and 10,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg,</span> respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulism/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. It is estimated that one gram of aerosolized botulism toxin could kill at least 1.5 million people [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulism/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The toxin itself has no smell or taste. If ingested, the toxin is primarily absorbed by the stomach and small intestine, although the large intestine is capable of absorbing the toxin as well. The toxin is resistant to degradation by gastric acidity and human alimentary enzymes alike. However, botulinum toxin is inactivated in chlorinated water after only 20 minutes of exposure and in fresh water after three to six days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulism/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important to perform a thorough history to identify possible exposures in patients presenting with a syndrome suggestive of botulism. This includes a history of home canning, exposure to other possible food sources (including honey in infants &lt;12 months of age), injection drug use, and cosmetic use of botulinum toxin. Bioterrorism should also be considered in patients presenting with possible botulism.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Incidence by mode of acquisition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An average of 110 cases of botulism are reported each year in the United States according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Approximately 72 percent of these cases are infant botulism, 25 percent are foodborne botulism, and the remaining 3 percent wound botulism. Adult infectious botulism is only occasionally reported.</p><p>Infant botulism has been recognized as a separate disease entity since 1976 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulism/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Since that time, over 900 cases of infant botulism have been reported in the United States, making it the most frequently reported form of botulism in the world [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulism/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Despite the frequency of infant botulism among all cases of botulism, the CDC notes little change in the number of cases of infant or foodborne botulism in recent years.</p><p>By contrast, reports of wound botulism have increased dramatically, most noticeably in California. From 1951 through 1987, an average of 0.49 wound botulism cases per year were reported to the California Department of Health Services compared with 2.25 cases per year in 1988 through 1991, 3 cases in 1992, 4 in 1993, 11 in 1994, and 23 in 1995 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulism/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Sources</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Wounds</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The vast majority of cases of wound botulism in California since 1988 has involved injection drug users, particularly those using &quot;black tar&quot; heroin by the subcutaneous or intramuscular (not intravascular) route [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulism/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Recurrent wound botulism has occurred in some injection drug users [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulism/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. How the heroin becomes contaminated with the clostridial organisms or their toxins is unknown.</p><p>Wound botulism has also been reported in patients who inhale cocaine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulism/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The patients presented with sinusitis, with one patient growing <em>C. botulinum</em> from a sinus aspirate.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Foodborne botulism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Foodborne cases of botulism are most commonly recognized as small outbreaks, usually involving home canned foods such as fruits, vegetables, and fish [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulism/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. Commercial products and restaurants are occasionally sources [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulism/abstract/23-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-30</a>].</p><p>The highest rates of foodborne botulism in the United States occur in Alaska Natives as a result of ingestion of fish and marine mammals that have been aged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulism/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. Surveillance data from the CDC between 1947 and 2007 found a mean annual incidence of 6.9 cases per 100,000 Alaska Native persons compared with an overall rate in the United States of 0.0068 cases per 100,000 persons. Toxin types A, B, and E have all been associated with foodborne botulism, although toxin type E is the most commonly implicated type in foodborne botulism in Alaska [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulism/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Several foodborne outbreaks have been described, as illustrated by the following reports:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A large outbreak of botulism involving 209 persons occurred in Thailand in March 2006 related to home-canned bamboo shoots [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulism/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. Ill persons had attended an annual religious rite where food was consumed and home-canned bamboo shoots were the only item eaten by all of the affected persons. <em>C. botulinum</em> was subsequently cultured from leftover bamboo shoots. Of the 209 persons affected, 141 were hospitalized and 42 required mechanical ventilation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Commercial carrot juice was identified as a source of type A botulism that resulted in the hospitalization of six patients in Georgia, Florida, and Ontario, Canada, in September 2006 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulism/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. Improper refrigeration during transport or storage was suspected to be responsible for growth of <em>C. botulinum</em> contaminating the juice, allowing production of botulinum toxin. In addition, no preservatives, salt, or sugars were added to the carrot juice, which may be necessary to prevent the germination of naturally present <em>C. botulinum</em> spores in the event of improper refrigeration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In 2007, an outbreak of botulism caused by sausage affected 66 individuals in China [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulism/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. An outbreak investigation revealed that the sausage had been transported and stored in retail outlets without refrigeration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Six outbreaks of botulism were reported among prison inmates in the United States between 2004 and 2016, affecting between 1 and 31 prisoners per outbreak [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulism/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. The largest outbreak occurred in a prison in Mississippi in 2016 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulism/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Investigations identified prison brew (also known as pruno, hooch, moonshine, or bootleg), an illicit alcoholic beverage, as the source of the outbreaks. Prison brew is typically made by fermenting fruit and sugar in water along with bread to provide yeast; other commonly used ingredients include vegetables, potatoes, corn, and rice.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In 2012, two cases of botulism occurred in Chinese immigrants in the United States who had purchased fresh tofu from the same grocery and used similar recipes to ferment the tofu at home [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulism/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The tofu had been stored in the grocery in unrefrigerated, uncovered, water-filled bins. The home-fermentation process involved prolonged storage at room temperature in a low-acid and low-salt environment, which might have facilitated spore germination and toxin formation. Although fermented tofu is a rare cause of botulism in the United States, in China, home-fermented tofu and other fermented bean products cause more than half of the cases of foodborne botulism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulism/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In 2015, a large outbreak of botulism affected 29 of 77 attendees of a church potluck meal in Ohio, resulting in one death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulism/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The source was potato salad made from home-canned potatoes that had been prepared using a boiling water canner (which does not kill <em>C. botulinum</em> spores) rather than a pressure canner (which does eliminate spores). The potatoes were also not heated after removal from the can, a step that can inactivate botulinum toxin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Outbreaks in the United States between 1973 and 2015 that have involved &gt;10 cases (including the outbreak described above) are summarized in the following table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F103142\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103142 \">table 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In 2016, the following products were recalled for potential <em>C. botulinum</em> contamination in the United States, Canada, and the European Union: smoked salmon, salmon roe, salmon bacon, sardines, dried fish, fermented seal meat, various canned soups, homemade mustard relish, and canned white beans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulism/abstract/40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-42</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Infant botulism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infant botulism has long been associated with the ingestion of raw honey. However, this is most likely a minor environmental reservoir, since widespread education of the public has done little to affect the incidence of infant botulism in the United States.</p><p>Most cases in the United States are thought to result from ingestion of environmental dust and soil containing <em>C. botulinum</em> spores. The incidence of reported cases is highest in Utah, Pennsylvania, and California, states in which soil botulinum spore counts are high.

The 1972 Biological and Toxins Weapons Convention prohibited both research on and production of bioweapons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulism/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], although it is believed that Iran, Iraq, North Korea, and Syria have botulism toxin supplies intended for state-sponsored terrorism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulism/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Despite the potency of this toxin, its application as a bioterrorism weapon has been thwarted by technical complexities in concentrating and stabilizing the toxin for aerosolization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulism/abstract/4,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H975707959\"><span class=\"h3\">Iatrogenic botulism caused by cosmetic use of botulinum toxin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A newer cause, iatrogenic botulism, occurred in four patients who received botulinum toxin injections using an unlicensed, highly concentrated preparation of botulinum toxin A [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulism/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The patients may have received doses as high as 2857 times the estimated human lethal dose by injection and had serum toxin levels 21 to 43 times the estimated lethal human dose by injection.

Most cases occur between two and eight months of age, and the median age of onset is three to four months. The disease presentation and severity are variable, most likely due to variations in the size of the bacterial inoculum and in host susceptibility. The initial presentation may involve constipation, shortly followed by weakness, feeding difficulties, descending or global hypotonia, drooling, anorexia, irritability, and weak cry.</p><p>A detailed discussion of infant botulism is presented separately.

Prodromal symptoms often include nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and dry mouth with sore throat, but these symptoms can occur at any time throughout the course of the illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulism/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>Cranial nerve involvement most commonly marks the onset of symptomatic illness and can include blurred vision (secondary to fixed pupillary dilation and palsies of cranial nerves III, IV, and VI), diplopia, nystagmus, ptosis, dysphagia, dysarthria, and facial weakness. Descending muscle weakness usually progresses to the trunk and upper extremities, followed by the lower extremities. Urinary retention and constipation are common resulting from smooth muscle paralysis. Occasionally, paresthesias and asymmetric limb weakness are seen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulism/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Similar to infant botulism, respiratory difficulties (eg, dyspnea) requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation are common, caused by diaphragmatic paralysis, upper airway compromise, or both. Despite the evidence of neurologic involvement, cerebrospinal fluid analysis is normal.</p><p>The disease presentation can be quite variable, ranging from mild complaints or to death within the first 24 hours of developing symptoms. A small outbreak of clinically mild botulism resulted from exposure to low doses of botulinum toxin type E from contaminated, home-salted fish [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulism/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. All five patients presented with gastrointestinal symptoms and two had minimal cranial nerve palsies.

However, cases have been described involving abrasions, lacerations, open fractures, surgical incisions, and even a closed hematoma without appreciable skin defect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulism/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. A case has been reported of pelvic abscess, paralysis, and toxemia due to <em>C. botulinum</em> following a laparoscopic appendectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulism/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p>Wound botulism differs only slightly from foodborne botulism in presentation. Wound botulism lacks the prodromal GI symptoms common to foodborne botulism and has a longer incubation period of approximately ten days. Patients may also have fever with wound botulism, but this probably results from concurrent bacterial infection of the wound by non-clostridial species.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Adult infectious botulism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with this form of botulism develop enteric colonization with Clostridia and are found to have spores in their feces or in ingested food products. No preformed toxin is identified in any food source. The normal GI tract, except in infants, is resistant to colonization by <em>C. botulinum</em>. The changes in intestinal flora or mucosal defense required to allow this colonization are not known. However, it is thought that achlorhydria, GI diseases, or the postoperative state predispose to colonization. This syndrome resembles infant botulism in its symptoms and course.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3354213593\"><span class=\"h2\">Bioterrorism-associated botulism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, <em>C. botulinum</em> toxins are considered possible agents of bioterrorism. Delivery by aerosol or by the foodborne route results in an acute symmetric descending flaccid paralysis with prominent bulbar palsies (diplopia, dysarthria, dysphonia, and dysphagia) after 12 to 72 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulism/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

Less likely diagnoses include tetrodotoxin and shellfish poisoning and antimicrobial-associated paralysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulism/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>The differential diagnosis of infant botulism is discussed separately.

Tensilon (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=edrophonium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">edrophonium</a>) tests to rule out myasthenia gravis should not be conducted, as they are often falsely positive in patients with botulism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulism/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome usually involves ascending paralysis, sensory findings, and elevated cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulism/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. A tick check should be performed as part of the physical examination since the ticks transmitting tick paralysis may still be attached when the patient presents. Cerebrospinal fluid studies of most patients with meningitis and encephalitis will reveal elevated protein and red and white blood cells. White blood cell counts, CSF studies, and sedimentation rates are all normal in patients with botulism.</p><p>Typical EMG findings are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Foodborne botulism'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most important issue in the diagnosis of any of the four syndromes of botulism is the initial consideration of the disease. A careful history and physical examination are essential.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Infant botulism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infant botulism is a rare disorder and the diagnosis is often missed. As an example, the diagnosis was suspected on admission in only one-half of infants enrolled in a randomized trial testing the efficacy of botulinum <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulism/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p>Serum assays for botulinum toxin are often negative in cases of infant botulism. The diagnosis is supported by the isolation of <em>C. botulinum</em> spores from the stool and is confirmed by the identification of botulinum toxin in stool samples. However, stool sample assays do not yield timely results. Anaerobic cultures often take up to six days for growth and identification of the organism, and initial detection of toxin requires one to four days.</p><p>The delays with these confirmatory tests are important since therapy should be administered as early as possible. Thus, a presumptive diagnosis should be made based upon the clinical presentation and electrophysiologic findings (electromyogram [EMG]), while the confirmatory stool studies are pending. These issues are discussed separately.

Demonstration of toxin in the blood is diagnostic. This laboratory test is performed by special laboratories whose locations may be obtained by contacting state epidemiologists or regional offices of the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).</p><p>Analysis of stool, vomitus, and suspected food items may also reveal toxin, which is diagnostic when coupled with the appropriate clinical and neurologic findings. Toxin has been detected from the serum up to 12 days following ingestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulism/abstract/25,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,55</a>].</p><p>EMG studies may be useful in these patients as well but are not generally required. Characteristic EMG findings in botulism include small M wave amplitudes, short bursts of low-voltage compound motor-units, and excessive action potentials. Repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) is associated with an incremental increase in M wave amplitude. In contrast, RNS in myasthenia gravis demonstrates a progressive decline in compound muscle action potential. Single-fiber EMG may be more useful and sensitive in differentiating botulism from myasthenia gravis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulism/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p>Patients with botulism are alert and do not have fever, headache, or meningismus.

The history should include questions about injection drug use and trauma. The only type of botulism to commonly involve fever and leukocytosis is wound botulism. One study found nearly half of the patients examined to have leukocytosis during their clinical course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulism/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p>Isolation of <em>C. botulinum</em> from the wound site is diagnostic and should be attempted. Specimens should be properly collected and transported using anaerobic transport media. When collecting a specimen for anaerobic culture, clinicians should generally consult with their microbiology laboratory to ensure that they are using proper technique. Although pus or tissue specimens yield the best results, a wound swab can be sent. Stool and vomitus assays for toxin yield nothing in cases of wound botulism and should not be attempted. Serum assays for toxin are frequently negative and therefore rarely helpful. As an example, among a cohort of 73 individuals with injection drug use&ndash;associated wound botulism, only 50 (68 percent) had toxin detected from the serum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulism/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p>EMG is a useful diagnostic tool in wound botulism.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Adult enteric</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnosis is based upon the same clinical findings and tests as for infant botulism.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Any patient with clinical signs, symptoms, or history suspicious for botulism should be hospitalized immediately and meticulously monitored for signs of respiratory failure.</p><p>A detailed discussion of infant botulism is presented separately.

If the clinical suspicion for botulism is high (eg, the patient is alert and afebrile but has the acute onset of bilateral cranial neuropathies associated with symmetric descending weakness) and symptoms are progressing, antitoxin should be administered as soon as possible and should not be delayed while awaiting results of diagnostic studies. For adults, one vial should be administered intravenously (IV) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulism/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. For children aged 1 to 17 years, 20 to 100 percent of the adult dose should be given. For infants &lt;1 year of age, 10 percent of the adult dose should be given. There does not appear to be any benefit from additional doses. Since equine botulinum toxin can cause sensitization and anaphylaxis, it should only be given to individuals thought to be at high risk for the disease based on clinical presentation and history suggestive of exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/botulism/abstract/55,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,62</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are two botulism antitoxin therapies available in the United States. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=equine-serum-heptavalent-botulism-antitoxin-united-states-availability-limited-to-cdc-distribution-from-strategic-national-stockpile-in-consultation-with-local-health-department-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Equine serum heptavalent botulism antitoxin</a> is used to treat children older than one year of age and adults; human-derived <a href=\"topic.htm?path=botulism-immune-globulin-intravenous-human-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">botulism immune globulin</a> is used for infants less than one year of age. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Antitoxin'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When botulism is suspected, the clinician should contact the State Health Department immediately for assistance with the decision of whether botulism antitoxin is indicated and to obtain a supply of antitoxin. If the clinical suspicion for botulism is high and symptoms are progressing, antitoxin should be administered as soon as possible and should not be delayed while awaiting results of diagnostic studies. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Equine serum botulism antitoxin'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuromuscular-junction-disorders-in-newborns-and-infants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuromuscular junction disorders in newborns and infants&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotics are recommended for wound botulism after antitoxin has been administered. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penicillin-g-intravenous-and-short-acting-intramuscular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Penicillin G</a> (3 million units intravenously [IV] every four hours in adults) provides effective coverage of other clostridial species and is frequently used. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metronidazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Metronidazole</a> (500 mg IV every eight hours) is a possible alternative for penicillin-allergic patients. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotics are not recommended for infant botulism or for adults with suspected gastrointestinal botulism because lysis of intraluminal <em>C. botulinum</em> could increase the amount of toxin available for absorption. (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotics'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Since most cases of botulism are foodborne, the most critical aspect of botulism prevention is proper food handling and preparation. Good home canning techniques will destroy spores. Infants &lt;12 months of age should not ingest honey. The most important measure for the prevention of would botulism is prompt medical evaluation and treatment of infected wounds. Injection of street drugs should be avoided.
