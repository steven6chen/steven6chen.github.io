It is caused by a blockage in a gland that makes tears. </p><p>A chalazion is different from a &quot;stye,&quot; which also causes a lump on the eyelid. But a stye is caused by an infection and is painful. A chalazion is not tender or painful, but it often lasts longer than a stye does.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3475187\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a chalazion?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A chalazion often begins with redness and swelling. Then, a firm, painless lump forms, usually in the upper eyelid. The lump can be as large as a pea. If a chalazion forms in the lower eyelid, it looks like a yellow-white bump (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F83659\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef83659 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3475202\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for a chalazion?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No. But your doctor or nurse should be able to tell if you have a chalazion by doing an exam and talking with you.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3475217\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to treat this?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. You can put warm, wet pressure on the chalazion. Wet a clean washcloth with warm water and put it over your chalazion. When the washcloth cools, reheat it with warm water and put it back over the chalazion. Repeat these steps for 15 minutes, 4 times a day. </p><p>You should <strong>not</strong> squeeze or pop your chalazion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3475232\"><span class=\"h1\">How is chalazion treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most of the time, a chalazion goes away with the treatment described above within a few weeks. It might even go away on its own. But if you have a large chalazion that does not go away or keeps coming back, your doctor might refer you to an eye doctor. He or she can do a procedure in the office to remove the chalazion or inject a medicine into the chalazion to reduce the swelling.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3475247\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=stye-hordeolum-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Stye (hordeolum) (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
