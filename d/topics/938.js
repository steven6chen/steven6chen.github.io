VATS typically involves one small, 4- to 8-cm incision for the camera, plus up to three additional small incisions for insertion of other instruments (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F88295\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef88295 \">figure 1</a>). This approach is used in selected patients to diagnose or treat intrathoracic or chest wall masses and other abnormalities, such as pericardial or pleural effusions. Compared with a thoracotomy, postoperative pain is minimized and other early outcomes may be improved by avoiding use of a rib spreader, severing of the intercostal nerves, or division of muscle tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-video-assisted-thoracoscopic-surgery-vats-for-pulmonary-resection/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>This topic will review anesthetic care for patients undergoing VATS for pulmonary resection. Anesthetic management for other VATS procedures (eg, pericardial window, drainage of pleural effusion, esophageal procedures) is similar. Anesthetic considerations for open thoracotomy with pulmonary resection as well as details regarding principles of one lung ventilation (OLV) and lung isolation techniques that are necessary for many VATS procedures are found in other topics:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-open-pulmonary-resection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for open pulmonary resection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=one-lung-ventilation-general-principles\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;One lung ventilation: General principles&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-isolation-techniques\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lung isolation techniques&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Surgical considerations for VATS procedures are addressed separately.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-open-pulmonary-resection#H642462381\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for open pulmonary resection&quot;, section on 'Preanesthetic consultation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-patients-with-an-anterior-mediastinal-mass#H763574646\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for patients with an anterior mediastinal mass&quot;, section on 'Preanesthetic assessment'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Many patients undergoing VATS for pulmonary resection have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. If severe, pulmonary function tests (PFTs) are typically obtained to identify high-risk patients who may not tolerate one lung ventilation (OLV). This is the only absolute contraindication to VATS pulmonary resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-video-assisted-thoracoscopic-surgery-vats-for-pulmonary-resection/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. PFTs may be unnecessary for minor VATS procedures that could be performed with very brief periods of either OLV or apnea (eg, pleural biopsy). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=one-lung-ventilation-general-principles#H90533736\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;One lung ventilation: General principles&quot;, section on 'Contraindications'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Preparation </strong>&ndash; Standard preanesthetic preparations for pulmonary resection via VATS are similar to those for open pulmonary resection, including (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-open-pulmonary-resection#H642462394\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for open pulmonary resection&quot;, section on 'Preanesthetic preparation'</a>):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Preparation for airway control</strong> &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-isolation-techniques\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lung isolation techniques&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Intravenous (IV) access </strong>&ndash; At least one large-bore IV catheter is necessary for a VATS procedure, although blood loss is usually minimal. Increased potential for bleeding exists in cases requiring hilar dissection, or if there are adhesions caused by radiation therapy or prior surgery. In such cases, it is prudent to insert two large-bore peripheral IV catheters because bleeding may be difficult to control surgically. Antecubital IV catheters may not flow in the arm on the operative side while it is bent at the elbow in the flexed lateral decubitus position (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F90719\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90719 \">figure 2</a>). In rare cases, central venous access is employed to ensure adequate vascular access.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Preparation for hemodynamic monitoring</strong> &ndash; Although not always necessary, preparations for invasive hemodynamic monitoring may be employed in selected VATS procedures. (See <a href=\"#H4157774662\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Regional analgesic technique</strong> &ndash; Placement of a thoracic epidural or paravertebral block is typically reserved for patients undergoing a nonintubated thoracoscopic VATS procedure, or if conversion to open thoracotomy is considered likely. (See <a href=\"#H2309893193\" class=\"local\">'Nonintubated thoracoscopic surgery'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-open-pulmonary-resection#H1267114325\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for open pulmonary resection&quot;, section on 'Planning for postoperative analgesia'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Regional techniques (eg, intercostal, serratus anterior, or erector spinae blocks) may be useful when postoperative opioids should be avoided or minimized.

These monitors are secured to prevent displacement during repositioning to a lateral decubitus position (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F90719\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90719 \">figure 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-open-pulmonary-resection#H2293088452\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for open pulmonary resection&quot;, section on 'Monitoring'</a>.)</p><p>We employ an intraarterial catheter to continuously monitor blood pressure (BP) in selected patients undergoing lobectomy or more extensive pulmonary resection, or for lesser resections if there is a risk for significant bleeding (eg, hilar involvement or extensive adhesions) or hemodynamic instability (eg, cardiovascular comorbidity). The catheter is also useful for intermittent sampling of arterial blood gases (particularly during one lung ventilation [OLV]). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-open-pulmonary-resection#H2293088452\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for open pulmonary resection&quot;, section on 'Monitoring'</a>.)</p><p>Other invasive monitors (eg, central venous catheters or pulmonary artery catheters) are rarely used. Occasionally, intraoperative transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) is urgently employed to rapidly diagnose unanticipated causes of severe hemodynamic instability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-video-assisted-thoracoscopic-surgery-vats-for-pulmonary-resection/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Selection of agents and techniques for induction is based on coexisting disease. During the maintenance phase, the patient must remain anesthetized, paralyzed, and mechanically ventilated to provide optimal surgical conditions. Choices of anesthetic agents for patients undergoing pulmonary resection with OLV are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=one-lung-ventilation-general-principles#H553141\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;One lung ventilation: General principles&quot;, section on 'Anesthetic choice'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-open-pulmonary-resection#H1754771630\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for open pulmonary resection&quot;, section on 'Induction and maintenance'</a>.)</p><p/><p>Rather than general anesthesia, local or regional anesthetic techniques may be employed for nonintubated thoracoscopic surgery.

This is done to look for endobronchial lesions that might change the surgical plan, and to remove secretions that might impair oxygenation during OLV. In such cases, a single-lumen endotracheal tube (ETT) is initially inserted to facilitate surgical bronchoscopy. The anesthesiologist observes the bronchoscopy to discover bronchial anatomic factors that may influence lung isolation choices. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-adult-bronchoscopy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for adult bronchoscopy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>After bronchoscopy, the selected device to allow OLV is inserted, and positioning is checked with fiberoptic bronchoscopy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-isolation-techniques\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lung isolation techniques&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3520789300\"><span class=\"h2\">Positioning</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The patient is placed and stabilized in a lateral decubitus position with the operative side up. The operating room table is flexed to open the intercostal spaces and potentially reduce the pressure of surgical instruments against intercostal nerves (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F90719\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90719 \">figure 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H262193035\" class=\"local\">'Causes of pain'</a> below.)</p><p>This position change is managed by the anesthesiologist, with care to avoid displacement of airway devices, monitors, and vascular cannulae. Prevention of peripheral nerve damage, vision loss, and other injury requires precise positioning of extremities and padding of pressure points. Prevention of injury in a lateral decubitus or flexed lateral decubitus position is discussed in detail separately.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=one-lung-ventilation-general-principles#H553341\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;One lung ventilation: General principles&quot;, section on 'Ventilation strategies'</a>.)</p><p>Communication with the surgeon is necessary to determine initial timing, desired rapidity, and subsequent quality of lung collapse to produce OLV, as well as during specific intraoperative events. (See <a href=\"#H4010162514\" class=\"local\">'Intraoperative technical considerations'</a> below.)</p><p>Hypoxemia (SpO<sub>2</sub> &lt;90 percent) may develop during OLV. Management of hypoxemia during VATS is similar to other procedures requiring OLV, except that continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) is avoided in the nonventilated lung because a VATS procedure is disrupted with even partial inflation of the lung on the operative side. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=one-lung-ventilation-general-principles#H553349\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;One lung ventilation: General principles&quot;, section on 'Management of hypoxemia'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1656801876\"><span class=\"h2\">Fluid management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For most VATS procedures, barring unusual blood loss, we restrict intraoperative crystalloid administration to &lt;6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per hour, or 1 to 2 L total. Such a restrictive fluid strategy is associated with a lower incidence of pulmonary complications after open or VATS pulmonary resection, compared with more liberal fluid administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-video-assisted-thoracoscopic-surgery-vats-for-pulmonary-resection/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-open-pulmonary-resection#H2309202139\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for open pulmonary resection&quot;, section on 'Fluid and hemodynamic management'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4010162514\"><span class=\"h2\">Intraoperative technical considerations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The anesthesiologist provides assistance during procedure-specific intraoperative events:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Localizing the lesion</strong> &ndash; Surgeons most commonly locate small nodules by examination of preoperative computed tomography (CT) scans and insertion of a finger through a VATS port to palpate the surface of the lung. A Valsalva maneuver to the dependent lung can raise the mediastinum, thereby allowing the surgeon's finger to reach the lung surface. The operative lung should remain fully collapsed for optimal visualization and palpation of small nodules (see below). Other strategies include dye localization and image-guided techniques (see below).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Image-guided thoracoscopic surgery (iVATS)</strong> &ndash; The target lesion may be marked using a wire as a fiducial. This is typically accomplished in a hybrid operating suite with the aid of CT guidance and proprietary imaging software [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-video-assisted-thoracoscopic-surgery-vats-for-pulmonary-resection/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Initially, a temporary lung inflation (ie, breath hold) is achieved in both lungs by briefly clamping both lumens of the double-lumen tube at end-inspiration in order to allow a CT scan of motionless, inflated lungs. Subsequently, the nonoperative lung is ventilated using lung-protective tidal volumes (4 to 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg),</span> while the operative lung is held in a prolonged inflation as the fiducial wire is placed in the target lesion of that lung using CT guidance. Following placement of the wire, the operative lung is allowed to collapse, and the VATS procedure is performed while the patient is still in the hybrid suite [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-video-assisted-thoracoscopic-surgery-vats-for-pulmonary-resection/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dye localization</strong> &ndash; If dye was previously deposited on the target lesion, either percutaneously or via electromagnetic navigational bronchoscopy, the lung is allowed to remain partially inflated when the VATS camera is initially inserted. This facilitates visualization of the dye marking the lesion on the pleural surface.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lung collapse</strong> &ndash; Maximal collapse of the operative lung is required for optimal surgical visualization during completion of pulmonary resection and other VATS procedures. If necessary, lung deflation may be expedited or improved by several maneuvers (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=one-lung-ventilation-general-principles#H975116067\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;One lung ventilation: General principles&quot;, section on 'Improving deflation of the nonventilated lung'</a>). Also, the surgeon may further facilitate lung collapse with gentle manual compression of lung tissue or by insufflation of carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vascular ligation </strong>&ndash; All patient movement is avoided during surgical ligation of a branch of the pulmonary artery (PA) in order to avoid vascular injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Right ventricular afterload may be increased after PA branch ligation, but this is well tolerated in most patients because blood flow to the operative lung has been previously reduced by gravity and hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. Since shunted blood volume to the operative lung is decreased after PA branch ligation, oxygenation will typically improve.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bronchial ligation </strong>&ndash; Immediately after the surgical stapling device is closed around a lobar bronchus, but before the staples are fired, the anesthesiologist may be asked to visualize the bronchial stump via fiberoptic bronchoscopy to confirm that the intended bronchial stump is completely closed and appropriately short, and that non-targeted bronchi remain patent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lung re-expansion </strong>&ndash; When the surgical procedure is complete, re-expansion of the nonventilated lung is necessary to reinflate all atelectatic areas and to allow the surgeon to check for significant air leaks at bronchial staple lines. The VATS monitor is observed to ensure gradual but complete recruitment of residual lung tissue. Details regarding re-expansion techniques are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=one-lung-ventilation-general-principles#H3870699628\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;One lung ventilation: General principles&quot;, section on 'Reexpansion of the nonventilated lung'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1800187278\"><span class=\"h2\">Final bronchoscopy and emergence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>At the end of the procedure, the patient is returned to the supine position. Often, the surgeon performs a final fiberoptic bronchoscopic examination to ensure that the bronchial passageways are patent, to remove residual blood and secretions, and to examine the newly created bronchial stump. If a double-lumen tube (DLT) has been used, the surgeon may perform bronchoscopy via this DLT, or it may be exchanged to a single-lumen tube or a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) if necessary to accommodate a large bronchoscope or surgeon-specific preferences. Strategies to prevent loss of airway control or laryngospasm during this tube exchange are described elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-open-pulmonary-resection#H1605458047\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for open pulmonary resection&quot;, section on 'Final bronchoscopy and emergence'</a>.)</p><p>Following bronchoscopy, the patient is placed in the semi-Fowler's position (partially sitting with the head of the bed up at a 30 to 45 degree angle) for emergence from anesthesia. When the usual criteria have been satisfied, the patient may be extubated.

A few anesthetic considerations for RATS differ from standard VATS procedures:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lung isolation techniques </strong>&ndash; Lung isolation is usually performed with a left double-lumen tube (DLT) because access to the head is limited by the robotic equipment (although this is less problematic with newer robotic equipment). Positioning of a left DLT is easier and the likelihood of displacement is lower compared with a right DLT or bronchial blockers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-isolation-techniques\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lung isolation techniques&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-isolation-techniques#H4034204392\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lung isolation techniques&quot;, section on 'Device choice: General considerations'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A DLT with an incorporated video camera may be used. This provides a continuous view of the carina to detect tube malposition without insertion of a bronchoscope. Such monitoring may be more convenient during RATS cases due to limited access to the airway (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F109441\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef109441 \">picture 1</a>), although there are no data demonstrating an outcome advantage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">To facilitate lung collapse, the surgeon may employ carbon dioxide (CO<sub>2</sub>) insufflation, typically with an insufflation pressure of 8 mmHg.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Absence of movement </strong>&ndash; Neuromuscular blockade is carefully monitored with a peripheral nerve stimulator to avoid any patient movement and possible patient injury. The appropriate surgical response to patient movement is immediate withdrawal of the robotic arms from the chest cavity, but this response may be delayed because the surgeon is sequestered at the robotic console and does not have direct tactile sensation to detect movement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Emergency responses </strong>&ndash; Because the surgeon is unable to see the patient or events in the room except for those shown on his camera, situational awareness is reduced and communication is impaired. This may delay recognition of a complication and cause communication errors. Patient safety requires well-established and practiced surgical team responses to emergencies such as cardiac arrest or hemorrhage as soon as they are recognized. Conversion to open resection may be necessary in some patients.

Such nonintubated thoracoscopic surgery (NITS) techniques have been employed (often through a single port) for management of pleural effusions, pneumothorax, empyema, or biopsies of the lung or pleura in patients with severe comorbidities that confer increased risk for general anesthesia. Less commonly, NITS is performed for anatomic lung resection.</p><p/><p>Contraindications include hemodynamic instability, morbid obesity, inability to cooperate, extensive pleural adhesions, large centrally located tumors, a difficult airway, or any contraindication to the planned regional anesthetic technique (eg, coagulopathy).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Anesthetic techniques</strong> &ndash; Anesthetic management typically includes a local <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> regional technique plus supplemental sedation. Continuous thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) or paravertebral block (PVB) may be used to provide regional anesthesia during NITS procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-video-assisted-thoracoscopic-surgery-vats-for-pulmonary-resection/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>], and these are the most effective techniques for postthoracotomy analgesia. Choice between a TEA or PVB technique is primarily based on clinician expertise and preference. Other regional techniques have been successfully employed for intraoperative <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> postoperative analgesia. These include intercostal blocks with or without catheters, serratus anterior plane blocks, intrapleural administration of local anesthetics, local wound infiltration, intrathoracic vagal block to attenuate the cough reflex, and combinations of these techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-video-assisted-thoracoscopic-surgery-vats-for-pulmonary-resection/abstract/9,13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,13-15</a>].

In general, opioids are used judiciously to minimize the risk of oversedation with loss of airway. Mild permissive hypercapnia is tolerated, particularly in patients with significant pulmonary disease. Some clinicians employ deep sedation, with or without periods of light general anesthesia, using a laryngeal mask airway (LMA) with maintenance of spontaneous ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-video-assisted-thoracoscopic-surgery-vats-for-pulmonary-resection/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>].

It is described as a dull, stabbing pain of moderate to severe intensity in the region of the deltoid muscle and lateral clavicle, occurring on the side of surgery within two hours after emergence. ISP usually lasts one to three days or until the chest drain is removed. Chronic hyperesthesia, hypoesthesia, dysesthesia, allodynia, and reduced mobility have been attributed to ISP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-video-assisted-thoracoscopic-surgery-vats-for-pulmonary-resection/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>The etiology of ISP is likely multifactorial.

Similarly, in a 2018 survey, TEA was used more frequently than PCA alone or PCA plus intercostal blocks for lobectomy performed via a VATS approach, but not for resection of smaller amounts of lung tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anesthesia-for-video-assisted-thoracoscopic-surgery-vats-for-pulmonary-resection/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

Regional anesthetic techniques are typically employed, supplemented by sedation with short-acting anesthetic agents.

Other adjunct IV or oral agents or a regional analgesic technique (eg, intercostal, serratus anterior, or erector spinae blocks) may be added to supplement postoperative pain control.
