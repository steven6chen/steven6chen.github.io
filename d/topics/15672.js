In 2004, SUNCT syndrome was included in the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 2<sup>nd</sup> edition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-lasting-unilateral-neuralgiform-headache-attacks-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], as was the related syndrome of short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks with cranial autonomic symptoms (SUNA). In 2013, both SUNCT and SUNA were classified as subtypes of short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F74387\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74387 \">table 2</a>) by the International Classification of Headache Disorders, 3rd edition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-lasting-unilateral-neuralgiform-headache-attacks-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both SUNCT and SUNA are rare headache syndromes, but the prevalence and incidence are uncertain. A study from Australia reported an estimated prevalence and annual incidence of 6.6 and 1.2 per 100,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-lasting-unilateral-neuralgiform-headache-attacks-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In contrast, an epidemiologic study from Norway found two subjects with SUNCT-like syndromes in a population of 1838, corresponding to a prevalence of 109 per 100,000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-lasting-unilateral-neuralgiform-headache-attacks-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>The typical age of onset is between 35 and 65, as seen in approximately two-thirds of primary SUNCT cases, but ranges from 5 to 88 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-lasting-unilateral-neuralgiform-headache-attacks-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. A systematic review found that the mean age of onset for <span class=\"nowrap\">SUNCT/SUNA</span> was approximately 48 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-lasting-unilateral-neuralgiform-headache-attacks-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>The syndrome of short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks has a male predominance. In a literature review published in 2013, with 222 cases (189 SUNCT, 31 SUNA, and 2 with both SUNCT and SUNA), the male-to-female ratio was 1.5:1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-lasting-unilateral-neuralgiform-headache-attacks-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SUNCT and SUNA are characterized by sudden brief attacks of severe unilateral head pain in orbital, peri-orbital, or temporal regions, accompanied by ipsilateral cranial autonomic symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-lasting-unilateral-neuralgiform-headache-attacks-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>In SUNCT, the ipsilateral autonomic symptoms at a minimum consist of both conjunctival injection and lacrimation. In SUNA, the autonomic symptoms may include either conjunctival injection or lacrimation, but not both. Otherwise, the presence of cranial autonomic symptoms for SUNCT and SUNA is similar, and may include nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, miosis, ptosis, eyelid edema, or forehead and facial sweating <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> flushing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-lasting-unilateral-neuralgiform-headache-attacks-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

In an earlier report of 21 patients with SUNCT, symptomatic bouts typically occurred once or twice a year and lasted from days to months, with remissions lasting months at a time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-lasting-unilateral-neuralgiform-headache-attacks-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Results from another series of 24 patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">SUNCT/SUNA</span> suggested that the episodic form (attacks lasting seven days to one year, separated by a pain-free period lasting one month or longer) was more common than the chronic form (14 versus 10 subjects) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-lasting-unilateral-neuralgiform-headache-attacks-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. However, the time since diagnosis was relatively short for most of the patients in this series, and the natural progression of these syndromes points to a tendency to become chronic. In a larger series of 52 patients with longer follow-up, a chronic form was noted in 27 of 43 patients (63 percent) with SUNCT and in all 9 patients with SUNA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-lasting-unilateral-neuralgiform-headache-attacks-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

A persistent dull interictal ache with SUNCT was also described in two cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-lasting-unilateral-neuralgiform-headache-attacks-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Family history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is one reported kindred of a family history of SUNCT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-lasting-unilateral-neuralgiform-headache-attacks-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

Some triggers characteristically associated with cluster headache, such as alcohol, smoke, strong smells and a warm environment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-lasting-unilateral-neuralgiform-headache-attacks-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], can also trigger SUNCT or SUNA in a small proportion of patients.</p><p>Patients can have a mixture of spontaneous and triggered attacks, but purely triggered attacks are rarely reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-lasting-unilateral-neuralgiform-headache-attacks-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. A potential explanation is that some cases of purely triggered attacks may have been incorrectly diagnosed as trigeminal neuralgia. Thus, it is useful to recognize that occasional patients with SUNCT syndrome may experience only triggered attacks. In one of the larger series of 43 patients with SUNCT, a mixture of spontaneous and triggered attacks, purely spontaneous attacks, and purely triggered attacks occurred in 84, 14 and 2 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-lasting-unilateral-neuralgiform-headache-attacks-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>A literature review, with data on trigger factors available for 176 patients, reported exclusively spontaneous attacks in 27 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-lasting-unilateral-neuralgiform-headache-attacks-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Lack of refractory period</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unlike trigeminal neuralgia, short-lasting unilateral neuralgiform headache attacks generally do not have a refractory period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-lasting-unilateral-neuralgiform-headache-attacks-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/5,10,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,10,14</a>].

Although there are variations in recommended titration schedules and dosages, we suggest a nine day trial of oral indomethacin. During the nine day trial, patients increase the indomethacin dose every three days (up to a maximum total daily dose of 225 mg) unless they have resolution of headache, in which case they continue at the effective dose. The starting dose is indomethacin 75 mg to 100 mg daily (given in three divided doses) for three days; the dose can then be increased if necessary to a total daily dose of 150 mg for three days, followed if necessary by a total daily dose of 200 mg to 225 mg daily (given in at least three divided doses per day) for three days.

The distinction between trigeminal autonomic cephalalgias, such as SUNCT, and trigeminal neuralgia is, at least in part, the degree of cranial autonomic activation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-lasting-unilateral-neuralgiform-headache-attacks-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>Similar to SUNCT and SUNA, trigeminal neuralgia can be precipitated by trivial stimuli such as washing, shaving, smoking, talking, and brushing the teeth, although attacks can occur spontaneously. The pains usually remit for variable periods. Neurovascular compression in the root entry zone of the trigeminal nerve in the cerebellopontine angle cistern is widely believed to be the essential mechanism for the pathogenesis of trigeminal neuralgia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trigeminal-neuralgia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trigeminal neuralgia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Given the short, stabbing nature of the attacks, the cutaneous triggering, and the association of cranial autonomic symptoms with pain in the trigeminal V1 distribution, the differentiation between trigeminal neuralgia and SUNCT has often been difficult, especially in the elderly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/short-lasting-unilateral-neuralgiform-headache-attacks-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>].
