The condition develops as a consequence of chronic gastroesophageal reflux disease and predisposes to the development of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus.</p><p>Traditionally, high-grade dysplasia and intramucosal cancer arising from BE were treated with esophagectomy, while non-dysplastic BE and BE with low-grade dysplasia were managed with endoscopic surveillance. Problems associated with these approaches included significant morbidity and mortality from esophagectomy and the risk of missed or interval development of cancer in patients undergoing surveillance. To address these issues, less invasive endoscopic treatments have been developed.</p><p>Radiofrequency ablation is an endoscopic treatment modality for eradication of BE. Primary circumferential ablation is performed using a balloon-based bipolar electrode, while secondary treatment of residual BE is performed using an endoscope-mounted bipolar electrode on an articulated platform. Studies suggest that this ablation technique is highly effective in removing Barrett's mucosa and associated dysplasia and in preventing progression of disease, while minimizing the known drawbacks of photodynamic therapy and argon plasma coagulation, such as esophageal stenosis and subsquamous foci of BE (&quot;buried Barrett's&quot;).</p><p>This topic will review the use of radiofrequency ablation for the treatment of Barrett's esophagus.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barretts-esophagus-treatment-of-high-grade-dysplasia-or-early-cancer-with-endoscopic-resection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Barrett's esophagus: Treatment of high-grade dysplasia or early cancer with endoscopic resection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H57828724\" class=\"local\">'Combining endoscopic mucosal resection and RFA'</a> below.)</p><p>EMR provides a relatively large tissue specimen that allows for histopathological staging of a lesion, enabling selection of patients for endoscopic treatment who have HGD or IMC and a low risk of lymph node involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-with-radiofrequency-ablation/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Patients found to have submucosal invading lesions on histology (&gt;T1sm1) have a 15 to 30 percent risk of positive local lymph nodes and should be referred for surgery. On the other hand, the risk of lymph node involvement is minimal in patients with IMC, making these patients candidates for endoscopic management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-with-radiofrequency-ablation/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p>A reason for combining ablative therapy with EMR is that EMR only removes a focal area from the BE, leaving the patient at risk for metachronous lesions arising from the residual Barrett's mucosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-with-radiofrequency-ablation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The addition of ablative therapy to EMR helps overcome this limitation.</p><p>In addition to staging a lesion, EMR is also done prior to RFA to provide a flat mucosa for RFA, which helps ensure that the ablation reaches the muscularis mucosae (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F54979\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef54979 \">picture 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Flat high-grade dysplasia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with Barrett's esophagus and HGD seem to be ideal candidates for RFA since successful eradication of their dysplastic BE prevents the development of cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-with-radiofrequency-ablation/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, proper patient selection is critical. Patients should have no visible lesions as these require EMR for optimal staging and treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barretts-esophagus-treatment-of-high-grade-dysplasia-or-early-cancer-with-endoscopic-resection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Barrett's esophagus: Treatment of high-grade dysplasia or early cancer with endoscopic resection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>To ensure that only patients with flat HGD are being treated with RFA monotherapy, several studies have required that patients undergo at least two high-resolution endoscopies with four-quadrant biopsies every 1 to 2 cm within two months prior to RFA to exclude cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-with-radiofrequency-ablation/abstract/1,2,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,8</a>]. The use of RFA for flat IMC has only been evaluated in retrospective cohort studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-with-radiofrequency-ablation/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3225554455\"><span class=\"h2\">Low-grade dysplasia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our approach is to offer radiofrequency ablation to most patients who have low-grade dysplasia that has persisted over time and has been confirmed by two expert pathologists. Treatment of low-grade dysplasia is associated with reduced rates of progression to high grade dysplasia or esophageal adenocarcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-with-radiofrequency-ablation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Other factors that influence the decision of whether or not to proceed with radiofrequency ablation for low-grade dysplasia include the patient&rsquo;s age and comorbidities, risk of adverse events associated with radiofrequency ablation, and patient preferences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-with-radiofrequency-ablation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p><br/>The natural history of low-grade dysplasia in Barrett esophagus is unclear. While some studies have reported that neoplastic progression rates for low-grade dysplasia are low (comparable to those reported for non-dysplastic Barrett esophagus) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-with-radiofrequency-ablation/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>], other studies have found that if the low-grade dysplasia diagnosis is confirmed by an expert pathologist, the risk of progression to high-grade dysplasia or esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC) may be as high as 27 percent within two years of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-with-radiofrequency-ablation/abstract/15-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-19</a>]. In a study of 255 patients with low-grade dysplasia who underwent a median of four endoscopies during a median follow-up of 42 months, risk factors associated with progression to high-grade dysplasia or esophageal cancer in 45 patients (18 percent) included agreement on the diagnosis of low-grade dysplasia by three expert pathologists (OR 47, 95% CI 13-170) and persistence of low-grade dysplasia at subsequent endoscopy (OR 9.3, 95% CI 4.4-19.6) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-with-radiofrequency-ablation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barretts-esophagus-surveillance-and-management#H66915892\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Barrett's esophagus: Surveillance and management&quot;, section on 'Dysplasia as a marker of risk'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barretts-esophagus-surveillance-and-management#H66920620\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Barrett's esophagus: Surveillance and management&quot;, section on 'Low-grade dysplasia'</a>.)</p><p>The use of radiofrequency ablation decreases the risk of progression of low-grade dysplasia to high-grade dysplasia or esophageal adenocarcinoma. In a meta-analysis of three studies (two of which were randomized trials) that compared radiofrequency ablation versus surveillance in patients with Barrett esophagus with low-grade dysplasia, the risk of progression to HGD or EAC was lower in the radiofrequency ablation group (RR 0.14 percent, 95% CI 0.04-0.45) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-with-radiofrequency-ablation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In a systemic review of mostly observational studies that included 2700 patients with Barrett esophagus and low-grade dysplasia who had either radiofrequency ablation or surveillance, the rate of progression to high-grade dysplasia or esophageal adenocarcinoma was also lower in the radiofrequency ablation group (1.7 versus 12.6 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-with-radiofrequency-ablation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Endoscopic surveillance for patients after a confirmed diagnosis of low grade dysplasia is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barretts-esophagus-surveillance-and-management#H66920620\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Barrett's esophagus: Surveillance and management&quot;, section on 'Low-grade dysplasia'</a>.)</p><p>Cost-utility models show that ablation is the preferred strategy for managing dysplastic Barrett esophagus over a wide range of conservative assumptions related to the efficacy of radiofrequency ablation. A cost-effectiveness analysis suggested that radiofrequency ablation is the preferred strategy for low-grade dysplasia, but only if the low-grade dysplasia is confirmed (ie, the diagnosis was agreed on by more than one pathologist) and stable (ie, low-grade dysplasia was seen on biopsies obtained at least six months apart) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-with-radiofrequency-ablation/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Cost-effectiveness'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3561040938\"><span class=\"h2\">Non-dysplastic BE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of progression to cancer in patients with non-dysplastic BE is small, and no objective markers are available to identify patients with an increased risk of developing cancer, though research looking at the risk-stratification of non-dysplastic BE has shown promising results. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barretts-esophagus-pathogenesis-and-malignant-transformation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Barrett's esophagus: Pathogenesis and malignant transformation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barretts-esophagus-surveillance-and-management#H82891986\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Barrett's esophagus: Surveillance and management&quot;, section on 'Cancer risk'</a>.)</p><p>Whether to offer RFA to patients with non-dysplastic BE is highly controversial and is influenced by many factors. An argument against RFA in these patients is that the annual risk of malignant progression is low, and many patients with BE are older adults with significant comorbid conditions that limit their life expectancy. Factors that favor treatment include the efficacy and safety profile of RFA and potential cost savings. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barretts-esophagus-pathogenesis-and-malignant-transformation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Barrett's esophagus: Pathogenesis and malignant transformation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> below and <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Adverse events'</a> below and <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Cost-effectiveness'</a> below.)</p><p>For most patients with non-dysplastic BE, the net health benefit of RFA may be too low to justify its use. However, RFA could be considered for selected patients (eg, &lt;50 years, a long BE segment, and a positive family history for esophageal adenocarcinoma). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barretts-esophagus-surveillance-and-management#H27\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Barrett's esophagus: Surveillance and management&quot;, section on 'Summary and recommendations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">ABLATION PROCEDURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) of Barrett's esophagus (BE) generally starts with a stepwise circumferential ablation procedure, followed by focal ablation for any residual BE (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F61557\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61557 \">figure 1</a>). RFA is performed using the Barrx FLEX system (previously HALOFLEX system), which is comprised of two distinct ablation catheters: the Barrx360 ablation balloon for primary circumferential RFA and the Barrx90 device for secondary focal RFA of BE. Three alternative focal ablation devices have become available: the Barrx90 ULTRA, the Barrx60, and the Channel RFA device.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Circumferential ablation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Circumferential RFA with the Barrx360 catheter involves the inflation of a balloon ablation catheter within the esophagus at the site of the BE. The ablation catheter includes a coiled electrode array through which radiofrequency energy is applied, ablating the Barrett's mucosa (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F69757\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69757 \">picture 2</a>). The Barrx360 catheter uses the Barrx FLEX energy generator (previously, the HALO360 generator was used).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Landmark determination &ndash; The first step in circumferential ablation is cleaning of the esophageal wall. In the past, this was done with 1 percent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetylcysteine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetylcysteine</a> and flushing with water to remove excessive mucus. Randomized trials have suggested that standard water rinses through the water jet channel of the endoscope are just as effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-with-radiofrequency-ablation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. We have therefore abandoned the cleaning with acetylcysteine. Next, the locations of the top of the gastric folds and the proximal extent of the BE (including islands) are recorded for reference during the sizing and ablation procedures. A stiff guidewire or metal wire is then introduced, and the endoscope is removed, leaving the guidewire in place.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Esophageal sizing &ndash; Once the guidewire is in place, a sizing catheter is connected to the Barrx FLEX generator, calibrated, and introduced over the guidewire. The sizing catheter is used to measure the inner esophageal diameter prior to circumferential ablation. It consists of a 165-cm long shaft with 1-cm markings and a clear, 4-cm long non-compliant balloon at its distal end (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F82456\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82456 \">picture 3</a>). Upon activation via a footswitch, the sizing balloon is inflated to 4.3 psi (0.30 atm) by the generator using an integrated pressure:volume system. Based upon the baseline balloon volume and geometry, the mean esophageal inner diameter is calculated along the entire length of the 4-cm long balloon.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The sizing procedure can be performed as a &quot;blind&quot; procedure using the 1-cm scale on the catheter shaft for reference. For the first measurement, the distal end of the balloon is placed 6 cm above the proximal extent of the Barrett's mucosa. After the first measurement cycle, the catheter is advanced 1 cm and the sizing process is repeated. This sequence is reiterated until an increase in measured diameter indicates the transition into a hiatal hernia or the stomach.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ablation catheter selection &ndash; Based on the esophageal inner diameter measurements, an appropriate Barrx360 ablation catheter is selected. The Barrx360 ablation catheter consists of a 165-cm long shaft with a balloon at its distal end that contains a 3-cm long bipolar electrode. The electrode contains 60 electrode rings that alternate in polarity and completely encircle the balloon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F59355\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59355 \">figure 2</a>). The ablation catheter is available in five outer diameters (18, 22, 25, 28, and 31 mm once inflated).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The outer diameter of the ablation balloon should be smaller than the narrowest measured esophageal diameter. In patients who underwent prior endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR), the ablation catheter should be selected conservatively (by taking an additional step down), keeping in mind that the sizing balloon calculates a mean inner diameter over a length of 4 cm, which might result in an overestimation of the esophageal inner diameter at the site of an EMR scar. For example, if the smallest measured diameter is 30 mm, a 28-mm balloon would be appropriate in a patient who had not undergone EMR, whereas a 25-mm balloon would be chosen for a patient who had undergone EMR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-with-radiofrequency-ablation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H57828724\" class=\"local\">'Combining endoscopic mucosal resection and RFA'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ablation regimens &ndash; Two different ablation regimens for circumferential ablation are currently in use. The standard ablation regimen, consisting of two applications of 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">J/cm<sup>2</sup></span> with a cleaning phase in between, is the most widely used regimen and has been studied extensively. A simplified regimen without a cleaning phase has been proposed. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Standard<strong> </strong>circumferential ablation&quot; &ndash; The ablation catheter is introduced over the guidewire, followed by the endoscope, which is advanced alongside the ablation catheter. Under endoscopic visualization, the proximal margin of the electrode is placed 1 cm above the most proximal extent of the BE.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The ablation catheter is then inflated to 3 psi. Upon activation, radiofrequency energy is delivered to the electrode. Energy delivery typically lasts less than 1.5 seconds, after which the balloon automatically deflates. Moving distally, the balloon is repositioned, allowing a small amount of overlap with the previous ablation zone (5 to 10 mm). Ablation is repeated until the entire length of BE has received one application of radiofrequency energy. We treat the entire BE segment in a single session irrespective of its length. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">After the entire length of BE has undergone one ablation cycle, the guidewire, ablation catheter, and endoscope are removed. Once outside the patient, the catheter is inflated and any adherent coagulum on the electrode surface is removed using wet gauze. A soft distal attachment cap is then fitted on the tip of the endoscope, and the scope is reintroduced into the patient. The soft extending rim of the cap is used to gently slough off the coagulum from the esophageal wall in the ablation zone. After most of the coagulum has been removed with the cap, forceful spraying of water through a spraying catheter using a high-pressure pistol can be used to wash off residual coagulum. Although the cleaning procedure requires extra procedure time, previous studies suggested that it increases the efficacy of the ablation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-with-radiofrequency-ablation/abstract/1,2,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">After the cleaning procedure, the entire length of BE is ablated again using the same energy settings. A circumferential ablation treatment using the Barrx360 catheter takes approximately 30 to 40 minutes depending on the length of the BE.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We would advise using the standard regimen in patients with a complex or tortuous Barrett's esophagus (eg, a relative stenosis, narrowing at the endoscopic resection site). The cleaning step of the standard regimen is a good way to assess the completeness of the first ablation pass and allows for necessary adjustments of the balloon position to treat skipped zones. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Simplified circumferential ablation&quot; &ndash; A randomized trial demonstrated that circumferential radiofrequency ablation is easier and faster, but equally safe and effective, when the cleaning phase between ablations is omitted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-with-radiofrequency-ablation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. By omitting the cleaning phase, the procedure time was reduced to 25 minutes. At three months after the circumferential ablation, the percentage of Barrett's surface regression did not differ significantly between those who underwent a simplified ablation and those who underwent a standard ablation. In addition, complete eradication of neoplasia and intestinal metaplasia was similar in the two groups (100 and 90 percent, respectively).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Based on these results, we omit the cleaning phase between circumferential ablations in patients with uncomplicated Barrett's esophagus (without scarring or stenosis).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Follow-up circumferential ablation &ndash; Twelve weeks after the first circumferential ablation treatment, patients undergo a follow-up endoscopy, and additional therapy is carried out if needed. A <strong>circumferential</strong> <strong>ablation</strong> is performed if:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>There is residual circumferential BE measuring 2 cm or more</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>There are multiple islands or tongues of BE</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Follow-up focal ablation &ndash; At the 12-week follow-up endoscopy, patients are treated with secondary <strong>focal</strong> <strong>ablation</strong> using the Barrx90 catheter for:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Residual BE with a circumferential extent of less than 2 cm</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Circular treatment of the Z-line (at least once)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Small tongues of BE</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Scattered islands of BE</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Focal ablation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Focal RFA with the Barrx90 catheter also uses radiofrequency energy to ablate small areas of BE. For focal ablation, the electric current is delivered through an electrode array attached to the end of the endoscope (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F79660\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79660 \">picture 4</a>).</p><p>The electrode array is mounted on an articulated platform (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F72263\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72263 \">figure 3</a>), allowing the electrode to move front-to-back and left-to-right, ensuring optimal tissue contact. It can be attached with a flexible strap to the distal end of any endoscope with a diameter of 8.6 mm to 12.8 mm without impairing endoscopic view or function. The electrode array is 20.6 mm long and 13.2 mm wide with an active electrode-surface of 20 mm x 13 mm.</p><p>The FLEX generator is used for both circumferential (Barrx360) and focal RFA. The first generation HALO90 energy generator is used only with the Barrx90 catheter.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Electrode&nbsp;introduction &ndash; The Barrx90 electrode array fits on the tip of the endoscope and is placed at the 12 o'clock position in the endoscopic video image. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The device and endoscope are then introduced under visual guidance. When the laryngeal cavity is seen, the tip of the endoscope is deflected slightly downward. The endoscope is gently advanced into the esophagus, passing the leading edge of the catheter behind the arytenoids.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In approximately 10 percent of cases, introducing the electrode array may prove difficult. In those cases, a Zenker's diverticulum should be excluded. Introduction of the device should never be forced due to the risk of perforation. In these cases, we will sometimes blindly pass a biopsy forceps or the spraying catheter into the esophagus to guide the endoscope into the proximal esophagus. In difficult cases a CRE-balloon may be used to open the upper esophageal sphincter by manually inflating the balloon to a low pressure and then advancing the endoscope and Barrx90 device along with the balloon.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Standard focal ablation&quot; &ndash; Residual Barrett's epithelium is positioned at the 12 o'clock position in the endoscopic video image, corresponding to the position of the electrode.

This procedure requires only a single introduction of the Barrx90 electrode. In 41 patients, the efficacy of both regimens was compared in pairs of BE areas or islands. Three applications of radiofrequency energy at 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">J/cm<sup>2</sup></span> were non-inferior to the standard regimen for treatment of smaller BE areas. An important limitation of this study was that it only looked at the treatment of BE islands performed during a single procedure. In clinical practice, focal ablation is also used to ablate larger areas of BE mucosa and to ablate the circumference of the gastroesophageal junction. In addition, multiple focal procedures often are required to eradicate all Barrett's mucosa.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A retrospective study also examined efficacy and safety of the simplified focal ablation protocol. The study included 83 patients with dysplastic BE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-with-radiofrequency-ablation/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. After a median follow-up of 16 months, complete eradication of dysplasia was achieved in 100 percent of patients and complete eradication of intestinal metaplasia was achieved in 92 percent. Although the treatment was effective, significant adverse events were observed. In 9 out of 83 (11 percent) patients, a stenosis requiring dilation occurred (a rate that is at the far end of the spectrum reported in literature). A median three endoscopic dilations were required to resolve the stenosis, with three patients needing more than eight dilatations. An explanation could be that heat is &quot;stacked&quot; in the ablated area when three successive ablations at 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">J/cm2</span> without cleaning in between are performed, causing deeper injury. No long-term follow-up data of the simplified focal regimen are available yet. <br/></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Overall, the simplified regimen for focal RFA appears to be effective, practical for the endoscopist, and could reduce patient discomfort because fewer introductions of the scope and ablation catheter are necessary. However, concern remains about the stenosis rate when using the simplified regimen. An attractive option might be reducing the radiofrequency energy from 15 to 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">J/cm<sup>2</sup></span> while adhering to a simplified ablation regimen (3 x 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">J/cm<sup>2</sup>,</span> no cleaning); if 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">J/cm<sup>2</sup></span> are used the simplified regimen should only be applied to small areas of BE. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1028514768\"><span class=\"h2\">New ablation devices</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Three new ablation catheters have been added to the Barrx FLEX system: the Barrx90 Ultra catheter, the Barrx60 catheter, and a channel RFA device that can be advanced through the scope. All three catheters can be used alongside the Barrx90 catheter for secondary focal RFA of BE; however, no studies have yet evaluated the use of these devices in clinical practice. Recommendations for the use of these catheters are therefore based on previous experiences with the Barrx90 device:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Barrx90 Ultra device &ndash; The electrode array is mounted on an articulated platform in a similar way as the Barrx90 device, allowing the electrode to move front-to-back and left-to-right, ensuring optimal tissue contact. It can be attached with a flexible strap to the distal end of any endoscope with a recommended diameter of 8.6 mm to 9.8 mm without impairing endoscopic view or function. The electrode array is 40 mm long and 13 mm wide with an active electrode-surface area of 520 mm<sup>2</sup>, resulting in a 200 percent larger electrode surface as compared with the regular Barrx90 device. The Barrx90 Ultra is less well evaluated in terms of energy settings and safety when compared with the Barrx90 device. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">To prevent potential stenosis after focal ablation, the recommended treatment regimen consists of two double applications of radiofrequency energy at 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">J/cm<sup>2</sup>,</span> which has been studied extensively since the introduction of the Barrx90 device [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-with-radiofrequency-ablation/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. An alternative regimen for the Barrx90 Ultra device consists of three applications of 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">J/cm<sup>2</sup></span>. Patients can be treated with secondary focal ablation using the Barrx90 Ultra device if there are large tongues of residual BE or if there is short segment BE.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Barrx60 device &ndash; The electrode array is mounted on an articulated platform in a similar way as the Barrx90 device, allowing the electrode to move front-to-back and left-to-right, ensuring optimal tissue contact. It can be attached with a flexible strap to the distal end of any endoscope with a recommended diameter of 8.6 mm to 9.8 mm. The electrode array is 15 mm long and 10 mm wide; as a result, the active electrode surface area is 60 percent of the surface area of the Barrx90 device.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The recommended treatment regimen consists of two double applications of energy at 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">J/cm<sup>2</sup></span> or three applications of 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">J/cm<sup>2</sup></span>.

The design of the shaft provides catheter maneuverability, and the translucence of the device provides visibility. The electrode array is 15.7 mm long and 7.5 mm wide and has approximately the same active electrode surface area as the Barrx60 device. Since the channel device has only been tested in animal studies, the recommended treatment regimen consists of two double applications of energy at 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">J/cm<sup>2</sup></span> with cleaning or three applications of 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">J/cm<sup>2</sup></span>.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Post-treatment care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After RFA, acid suppressive therapy is important, not only to minimize patient discomfort but also to allow the esophagus to heal optimally and regenerate with squamous epithelium.

All patients should therefore receive high-dose proton pump inhibitors as maintenance therapy. In addition, extra acid suppression after each treatment session is advisable. We prescribe all patients <a href=\"topic.htm?path=esomeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">esomeprazole</a> 40 mg twice daily, supplemented with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ranitidine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ranitidine</a> 300 mg at bedtime, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sucralfate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sucralfate</a> suspension (5 mL of a 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL</span> suspension) four times a day for two weeks after each ablation session [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-with-radiofrequency-ablation/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. The proton pump inhibitor is continued as maintenance therapy.</p><p>After RFA, patients should adhere to a liquid diet for 24 hours. After 24 hours, patients may gradually advance to a soft and then normal diet at their own discretion, generally guided by their symptoms. Patients may experience symptoms of chest discomfort, sore throat, difficulty or pain with swallowing, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> nausea, which usually improve daily.</p><p>For patients who have pain following the procedure, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a> 500 to 1000 mg up to four times per day may be given as needed. Acetaminophen can be supplemented with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diclofenac-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diclofenac</a> supplements 50 mg up to twice daily if the acetaminophen does not provide adequate relief.

Overall, studies report complete eradication of intestinal metaplasia (CE-IM) rates of 54 to 100 percent and complete eradication of dysplasia (CE-D) rates of 80 to 100 percent. Although long-term follow-up studies are still limited, the five-year follow-up data suggest that eradication of the Barrett's mucosa is maintained in more than 90 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-with-radiofrequency-ablation/abstract/24,36,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,36,39</a>]. </p><p>One factor that may account for some of the variability in CE-IM and CE-D rates seen in studies is the use of different RFA protocols (circumferential versus circumferential plus focal RFA, whether standard ablation of the Z-line was performed, whether endoscopic mucosal resection was performed for visible lesions). Other factors may include stricter adherence to RFA protocols in prospective studies, variable baseline histology (non-dysplastic BE, low-grade dysplasia [LGD], high-grade dysplasia [HGD], or intramucosal carcinoma [IMC]), differences in the length of BE segments included in the studies, and differences in follow-up protocols.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H57828724\"><span class=\"h2\">Combining endoscopic mucosal resection and RFA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with visible abnormalities in a segment of BE that contains IMC or HGD may be treated with RFA, but only after endoscopic resection of the IMC or visible lesion.

However, one study with 90 patients (44 who underwent RFA following endoscopic resection and 46 who only underwent RFA) did not find a difference in the rate of stricture formation between the groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-with-radiofrequency-ablation/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].

Esophageal adenocarcinoma developed in 100 patients (2 percent; incidence of 7.8 per 1000 patient-years). Most of the cancers developed in patients with baseline HGD (83 patients).

Factors associated with cancer development included male sex, older age, longer BE segment length, and higher pathologic grade at baseline. These data should be cautiously interpreted since this is a registry study in which the appropriateness of indications, standardized treatment, and follow-up are not ensured.

Importantly, 71 percent of cases showed buried glands during RFA treatment. A finding of buried glands was always concomitant with the presence of Barrett's mucosa visualized on endoscopy or biopsy.

A study of 16 patients examined the sampling depth and presence of buried glands in biopsies and endoscopic resection specimens from neosquamous epithelium after RFA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-with-radiofrequency-ablation/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Four-quadrant routine biopsies were obtained every 2 cm from the neosquamous epithelium.

The absence of buried glands in all the specimens obtained in this study (including endoscopic resection specimens that sampled deep into the submucosa) is consistent with most clinical studies, in which buried glands are a rare finding. This suggests that RFA may be associated with complete eradication of all Barrett's epithelium.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">False-positive results</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tissue artifacts and residual BE may also lead to an incorrect diagnosis of buried Barrett's glands. Biopsies from neosquamous epithelium near the neosquamocolumnar junction may lead to sampling of the transition from neosquamous to columnar epithelium, leading to a histologic finding of glandular mucosa beneath the neosquamous epithelium, which may mistakenly be interpreted as buried Barrett's glands. In the case of a residual island of BE that was not treated with RFA, tangential sampling of the island combined with tangential sectioning of the biopsy may result in an erroneous finding of buried Barrett's [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-with-radiofrequency-ablation/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p>A diagnosis of buried Barrett's glands should only be made if the endoscopist is positive that there were no residual BE islands after detailed inspection with narrow band imaging, and if the biopsies were not obtained at the level of the neosquamocolumnar junction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-with-radiofrequency-ablation/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>].

After radiofrequency ablation (RFA) treatment, the gastroesophageal junction is frequently biopsied given the known increased risk of recurrences in this area, as endoscopic differentiation between gastric mucosa and IM is nearly impossible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-with-radiofrequency-ablation/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. However, the clinical relevance of IM when detected in this area is uncertain because focal IM in this area may reflect insufficient treatment, recurrence of disease, or an irrelevant normal finding. Several studies have reflected on the relevance of IM at the <span class=\"nowrap\">cardia/gastroesophageal</span> junction:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A Netherlands cohort study of 54 patients followed patients for five years after RFA, obtaining four-quadrant biopsies at every follow-up endoscopy (median 20 biopsies per patient) immediately below the gastroesophageal junction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-with-radiofrequency-ablation/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In 35 percent of patients, focal IM of the cardia was detected during follow-up. In 89 percent of these patients, focal IM of the cardia was only diagnosed on a single occasion. In total, 53 of 1143 biopsies contained focal IM. All of the patients with focal IM of the cardia had a normal endoscopic appearance of the neo-squamocolumnar junction, and none of these patients developed dysplasia after a median of 61 months of follow-up. None of these patients was retreated endoscopically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-with-radiofrequency-ablation/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In this study, IM of the cardia was mostly observed in a single biopsy, this diagnosis was generally not reproduced during further follow-up, and there was no increased incidence over time. If IM of the cardia reflects residual disease, one would expect to find IM more than once in a single patient. If IM of the cardia results from ongoing reflux after treatment, one would expect an increased incidence over time. It should be noted that all patients in this study received high-dose maintenance therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=esomeprazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">esomeprazole</a> 40 mg twice daily. Studies have shown that IM of the cardia can be detected in biopsies of 25 percent of the normal population, and this is generally not considered a premalignant condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-with-radiofrequency-ablation/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. The clinical relevance of focal IM of the cardia after RFA is therefore unknown, but these long-term data do not suggest that this is related to residual BE or recurrent disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a United States series that included 448 patients with BE with variable degrees of dysplasia, 17 patients developed recurrence of BE at the gastroesophageal junction only, after having achieved complete remission after RFA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-with-radiofrequency-ablation/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Of these, 72 percent of patients had IM. Forty-seven percent of patients with IM or dysplasia at the cardia had a normal endoscopic appearance of the neo-squamocolumnar junction. Follow-up results after detection of focal IM are not available.</p><p/><p>These studies show that the management of focal IM of the gastroesophageal junction varies widely as formal guidelines are lacking. The gastroesophageal junction remains an area at risk after endoscopic treatment and should be carefully inspected during follow-up with high-resolution endoscopy combined with advanced imaging techniques, and biopsies should be obtained immediately distal to the junction. Focal IM without dysplasia diagnosed on a single occasion does not appear to warrant treatment as the majority of patients do not develop dysplasia during follow-up.

All of the strictures resolved after a median of three dilations. There were no cases of bleeding (other than one patient who vomited blood-tinged mucus), perforation, or death.</p><p/><p>Performing endoscopic resection prior to RFA may increase the risk of complications. In a study of 65 patients, there were no complications in the 18 patients who had not previously undergone endoscopic resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-with-radiofrequency-ablation/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. In the 47 patients who had undergone endoscopic resection prior to circumferential RFA, mucosal lacerations were observed in patients who underwent RFA with a catheter that exceeded the smallest measured inner esophageal diameter and in patients whose endoscopic resection involved more than one-third of the esophageal circumference and was greater than 2.5 cm in length. Five cases of esophageal stenosis after RFA occurred, all in patients whose endoscopic resection involved more than 50 percent of the esophageal circumference and was longer than 2 cm in length.</p><p>Based on these observations, it is advisable to choose the size of the ablation catheters carefully in cases of prior endoscopic mucosal resection.

Techniques available to detect residual Barrett's esophagus (BE) include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High-definition white light endoscopy for detailed endoscopic inspection of the treatment area</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Narrow band imaging or comparable technologies (eg, FICE, i-scan) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barretts-esophagus-evaluation-with-narrow-band-imaging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Barrett's esophagus: Evaluation with narrow band imaging&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p>Detailed inspection of the neosquamous mucosa after radiofrequency ablation (RFA) by an endoscopist with a trained eye is important for two reasons: first, to detect even small areas of BE that can be additionally treated, as any residual BE puts the patient at risk of developing esophageal adenocarcinoma (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F79660\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79660 \">picture 4</a>); second, if random biopsies are obtained and accidentally small residual islands of Barrett's are sampled, this can result in a histological finding of buried Barrett's, causing doubts on the efficacy of the treatment and resulting in a missed opportunity to treat endoscopically visible remnants of Barrett's mucosa. </p><p>In a study evaluating the incidence of buried Barrett's in biopsies obtained after RFA, buried glands were found in 0.1 percent of biopsies from endoscopically normal neosquamous epithelium. However, when small islands of columnar mucosa were intentionally biopsied, buried glands were detected in 21 percent of biopsies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-with-radiofrequency-ablation/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. The low percentage of buried Barrett's in biopsies from neosquamous mucosa found in this study is similar to the 0 to 5 percent found in over 1000 patients from other studies on RFA for BE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-with-radiofrequency-ablation/abstract/7,27,35,36,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,27,35,36,58</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Buried Barrett's'</a> above.)</p><p>We recommend follow-up with high-resolution endoscopy and narrow band imaging, or a comparable technique, to carefully inspect the neo-squamocolumnar junction in antegrade and retroflexed positions to rule out the presence of small islands of Barrett's mucosa. The neo-squamocolumnar junction is the area most at risk for recurrence of neoplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-with-radiofrequency-ablation/abstract/45-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">45-47</a>]. A reliable endoscopic tool to predict if all Barrett's mucosa has been eradicated at this level is not available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-with-radiofrequency-ablation/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Even endoscopic detection techniques such as narrow band imaging have not been able to aid the endoscopist in the differentiation between gastric mucosa and intestinal metaplasia (IM) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-with-radiofrequency-ablation/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Therefore, we always obtain biopsies immediately distal (&lt;5 mm) to the neo-squamocolumnar junction as an objective endpoint for eradication of IM. The downside of this biopsy protocol is that it can lead to overestimation of non-dysplastic IM in the presence of a normal-appearing neo-squamocolumnar junction on endoscopy if the cardia is sampled. The presence of IM in the cardia during follow-up examination appears to be of limited clinical relevance (see <a href=\"#H1028514910\" class=\"local\">'Intestinal metaplasia of the cardia'</a> above). If IM is found in this region, we advocate repeating focal ablation only if the IM is detected at the first follow-up endoscopy. Touch-up ablation during subsequent follow&ndash;up endoscopies is unnecessary unless dysplasia is present.</p><p>Given the very low incidence of buried Barrett's reported in multiple studies, extensive biopsies from the neosquamous mucosa are, in our opinion, not necessary, provided that detailed inspection with high-resolution endoscopy with narrow band imaging did not show any columnar mucosa or mucosal irregularities.</p><p>If residual BE is found, ablation can be repeated every 12 weeks until it has been eradicated both visually and histologically. Most patients will need one circumferential ablation session and one to two focal ablation sessions to eradicate all dysplasia and Barrett's mucosa. We suggest a maximum number of two circumferential and three focal ablation sessions, which should be sufficient in most patients.</p><p>The recommended follow-up interval following complete eradication of IM depends on the initial grade of dysplasia: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with intramucosal <span class=\"nowrap\">carcinoma/high-grade</span> dysplasia, we recommend gradually increasing the interval of follow-up endoscopies if there has been complete eradication of dysplasia and complete eradication of IM to 3, 6, and 12 months after the last treatment session, then annually during the first five years. If there is sustained eradication of IM at that stage, surveillance can be stopped or intervals prolonged to every three to five years. Others perform surveillance endoscopies every three months for the first year, every six months for the second year, and annually thereafter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-with-radiofrequency-ablation/abstract/69,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">69,70</a>]. In our opinion this follow-up regimen is too strict for cases where complete remission of dysplasia and eradication of IM have been achieved.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with low-grade <span class=\"nowrap\">dysplasia/non-dysplastic</span> BE, we recommend follow-up endoscopy at 3 and 12 months after the last treatment session. If there is sustained eradication of IM at that stage, we stop surveillance. The published literature on the durability of RFA shows that the risk of progression in these patients is small [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-with-radiofrequency-ablation/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Recommendations for surveillance in patients with low grade dysplasia who have completed endoscopic eradication therapy and have no evidence of intestinal metaplasia vary. The American Gastroenterological Association recommends surveillance every year for two years and then every three years thereafter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-with-radiofrequency-ablation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, the American College of Gastroenterology suggests surveillance every six months for the first year, followed by annual surveillance thereafter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-with-radiofrequency-ablation/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].

The assumptions were conservative and used an estimate of BE eradication rate with RFA of 50 percent, which was intentionally lower than rates reported in published studies. They concluded that patient age, cost of RFA, and BE eradication rates were critical determinants of the cost-effectiveness of RFA. Within a range of these parameters, RFA was a cost-effective strategy for non-dysplastic BE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-with-radiofrequency-ablation/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A second model was designed to simulate the natural history of a cohort of patients with BE followed from age 50 until age 80 years or death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-with-radiofrequency-ablation/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. It compared the incremental cost-effectiveness between three competing strategies: (1) surveillance, (2) esophagectomy, and (3) RFA. Endoscopic ablation for patients with high-grade dysplasia (HGD) increased life expectancy by three quality-adjusted years at an incremental cost of less than $6000 compared with no intervention. RFA was also the most cost-effective strategy in patients with low-grade dysplasia (LGD) or no dysplasia if ablation permanently eradicated LGD in more than 28 percent of patients or non-dysplastic BE in more than 40 percent of patients. However, in order for RFA to be cost-effective, surveillance needed to stop after successful ablation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A third model used a hypothetical cohort of 50-year-old patients with BE, either with or without dysplasia, followed until the age of 80 years or death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/barretts-esophagus-treatment-with-radiofrequency-ablation/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The model compared three strategies: endoscopic surveillance with surgery when cancer was detected, endoscopic surveillance with RFA when dysplasia was detected, or initial RFA followed by endoscopic surveillance. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The study found that among patients with baseline HGD, initial RFA followed by endoscopic surveillance was more effective and less costly than the other approaches.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients with baseline LGD, initial RFA had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $18,231 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) compared with endoscopic surveillance followed by RFA for HGD, assuming an annual rate of progression to cancer of 0.5 percent. Several studies have reported progression rates for LGD that are significantly higher.

Different ablation regimens have been studied, leading to simplified ablation regimens. Circumferential ablation is cheaper and faster, but equally safe and effective, when the cleaning phase between ablations is omitted. Circumferential RFA can be further optimized by incorporating the sizing and ablation balloon into a single device, therefore further reducing the number of introductions of the endoscope and catheters. This may lead to a shortened procedure time and decreased patient discomfort, and is being studied in a randomized trial. </p><p>In addition, the simplified focal ablation regimen can be improved further. There is still controversy about the ideal energy settings for focal ablation. In Europe the focal device has been mainly used at 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">J/cm<sup>2</sup></span>. Lowering the energy density to 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">J/cm<sup>2</span> </sup>(in accordance with United States standard protocol) when using the simplified triple application may reduce the risk of fibrosis and stenosis even further.

Short to intermediate-term follow-up is promising, and five-year follow-up data suggest that the eradication of BE following RFA is maintained in more than 90 percent of patients. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Indications for radiofrequency ablation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients with non-dysplastic BE, the net health benefit of RFA may be too low to justify its use. However, RFA can be considered for selected patients (eg, &lt;50 years old, a long BE segment, and a positive family history for esophageal adenocarcinoma). (See <a href=\"#H3561040938\" class=\"local\">'Non-dysplastic BE'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>RFA can be used in conjunction with endoscopic resection for raised high-grade dysplasia or intramucosal carcinoma.

(See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Ablation procedures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Circumferential RFA involves inflation of a 3-cm long balloon ablation catheter (Barrx360 device) within the esophagus at the site of the BE. The balloon contains an electrode array through which an electric current is applied, ablating the Barrett's mucosa. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Ablation procedures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Secondary focal RFA to ablate small areas of BE also uses electrical energy to ablate the tissue, and the electrode array is attached to the end of the endoscope (Barrx90 device).
