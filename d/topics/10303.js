Continuous antimicrobial prophylaxis is recommended because recurrent ARF can be triggered by GAS infection even if asymptomatic. We register patients in regional ARF prevention programs, where available. Antibiotic selection, duration of therapy, supporting evidence, and patient education are described separately.

The patient should be stabilized medically and urgently referred to a Heart Valve Team to assess the optimum timing and type of surgery. Valve surgery is rarely necessary during an episode of ARF, usually only in patients with chordae tendineae rupture with acute severe MR for whom surgery can be lifesaving. If the patient can be stabilized medically, surgery may be deferred since surgical outcomes are generally better if valve surgery is performed when carditis is quiescent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prevention-of-rheumatic-heart-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

However, the side effects of glucocorticoids include gastrointestinal bleeding and fluid retention, both of which can worsen HF. If glucocorticoids are used, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents are stopped but are restarted once glucocorticoid treatment is discontinued. Glucocorticoids are stopped when HF is controlled and inflammatory markers have improved.

Avoidance of a need for anticoagulation in patients in sinus rhythm is particularly important for patients with significant barriers to compliance and limited access to monitoring as well as for patients undergoing valve surgery prior to possible pregnancy, given the risk of maternal and fetal complications including fetal adverse effects of vitamin K antagonist (VKA; eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a>) therapy.

In young populations with rheumatic MR, the possibility of repair may be high, but the long-term durability of repair is lower than for repair of degenerative mitral disease because of progressive rheumatic fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-prevention-of-rheumatic-heart-disease/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>].

Actuarial survival was 89 percent at 10 years and 82 percent at 20 years. Freedom from reoperation was 82 percent at 10 years and 55 percent at 20 years.

However, freedom from moderate or severe MR was only 32 percent.</p><p/><p>Data on comparative outcomes for MV repair versus replacement are limited to observational series.

Patients with moderate or severe MS who present with pulmonary edema without another precipitating cause should be stabilized medically and referred immediately for evaluation for percutaneous valvotomy or surgery.

No medical therapies have been proven to delay progression of leaflet disease. Patients should receive education about the expected disease course and symptoms that should be reported, such as dyspnea, reduced exercise tolerance, exertional chest pain, lightheadedness, and syncope. Serial evaluation is recommended to monitor for development of symptoms and increasing severity of aortic stenosis by examination and echocardiography. These issues are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-management-of-asymptomatic-aortic-stenosis-in-adults#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical management of asymptomatic aortic stenosis in adults&quot;, section on 'Serial evaluation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=natural-history-epidemiology-and-prognosis-of-aortic-stenosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Natural history, epidemiology, and prognosis of aortic stenosis&quot;</a>.)<strong> </strong></p><p>Symptomatic aortic stenosis is an indication for aortic valve replacement. Surgery or transcatheter aortic valve implantation in such patients is associated with marked reduction in symptoms and mortality. With certain exceptions, valve replacement should not be performed for isolated, severe aortic stenosis in asymptomatic patients, as discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indications-for-valve-replacement-in-aortic-stenosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Indications for valve replacement in aortic stenosis in adults&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Palliative care is recommended for patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis who are not candidates for surgery or transcatheter aortic valve implantation.

Therapy is dictated by close supervision (ie, visits every 6 to 12 months) by clinical examination for development of symptoms and echocardiography for progression of valve disease and evidence of LV dysfunction. Aortic valve replacement is indicated if symptoms develop <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> LV function deteriorates. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3333163752\"><span class=\"h2\">Management of tricuspid valve disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although data are limited, severe tricuspid stenosis may be amenable to percutaneous balloon valvotomy. Surgical correction of the stenotic lesion is indicated in patients whose valve is not treatable with balloon techniques. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tricuspid-stenosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tricuspid stenosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Management of TR, including indications for surgery, is discussed in detail separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-prognosis-of-tricuspid-regurgitation#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and prognosis of tricuspid regurgitation&quot;, section on 'Approach to management'</a>). TR often accompanies rheumatic MV disease and often progresses after MV surgery. For patients with TR and MR undergoing surgery for correction of MV disease, concurrent tricuspid valve annuloplasty is indicated if TR is severe, as well as in other settings. The rationale and indications for concurrent tricuspid valvuloplasty at the time of MV surgery are discussed separately.

(See <a href=\"#H3921966384\" class=\"local\">'General management of rheumatic heart disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The duration of prophylactic antibiotic administration for secondary prevention of ARF is adjusted depending upon the severity of rheumatic heart disease (RHD) as outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F55223\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55223 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3019486363\" class=\"local\">'Secondary prevention'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-rheumatic-fever-treatment-and-prevention#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute rheumatic fever: Treatment and prevention&quot;, section on 'Secondary prevention (antibiotic prophylaxis)'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest not treating carditis with glucocorticoids or intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immune-globulin-intravenous-subcutaneous-and-intramsucular-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">immune globulin</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The available limited-quality evidence has not demonstrated an improvement in cardiac outcomes with these agents. However, some experts use glucocorticoids in patients with severe carditis with acute cardiac failure. (See <a href=\"#H1798560999\" class=\"local\">'General management of carditis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H786245216\" class=\"local\">'Severe carditis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The cause of HF in ARF is generally severe mitral regurgitation (MR; eg, associated with a ruptured chord). The patient should be stabilized medically and urgently referred to a Heart Valve Team to assess the optimum timing and type of surgery. (See <a href=\"#H786245216\" class=\"local\">'Severe carditis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2650000888\" class=\"local\">'Management of mitral regurgitation'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-mitral-regurgitation-in-adults#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute mitral regurgitation in adults&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with rheumatic valve disease should undergo periodic clinical and echocardiographic evaluation with frequency based upon the severity of disease, as described for individual valve lesions above. Standard indications for valve intervention apply with choice of procedure (eg, mitral valve [MV] repair or replacement) based upon patient characteristics and available treatment options. (See <a href=\"#H3921966384\" class=\"local\">'General management of rheumatic heart disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with rheumatic MR with an indication for MV surgery, valve repair, if feasible, is preferred over valve replacement since repair avoids the need for long-term anticoagulation associated with mechanical valves and the long-term risk of deterioration of a bioprosthesis. (See <a href=\"#H2650000888\" class=\"local\">'Management of mitral regurgitation'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-chronic-primary-mitral-regurgitation#H746544446\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of chronic primary mitral regurgitation&quot;, section on 'Surgical mitral valve repair versus replacement'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Since mitral stenosis (MS) is a mechanical disorder, the patient with moderate or severe MS should be referred for evaluation for percutaneous valvotomy or surgery as soon as symptoms develop. (See <a href=\"#H2596747147\" class=\"local\">'Management of mitral stenosis'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-management-and-indications-for-intervention-for-mitral-stenosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical management and indications for intervention for mitral stenosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The natural history of concomitant MS and MR is worse than for isolated regurgitation. Prosthetic valve replacement is required when symptoms are present and there is mixed moderate stenosis and moderate regurgitation, even though either lesion in isolation might not be considered &quot;severe.&quot; (See <a href=\"#H1885596050\" class=\"local\">'Management of mixed mitral disease'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">WHO Technical Report Series.
