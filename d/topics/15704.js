While they usually present in childhood, there may be cases in which these conditions are not diagnosed until adolescence or adulthood, especially if their presentation is mild and thus delayed. (See <a href=\"#H1385838383\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic approach'</a> below.)</p><p>Inherited sideroblastic anemias include nonsyndromic and syndromic disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F79712\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79712 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nonsyndromic</strong> &ndash; The nonsyndromic forms present with anemia but lack other clinical manifestations.

A typical presentation is of a young boy, perhaps slightly small for age, with no other clinical features and no family history of anemia, who presents with a hemoglobin of 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL,</span> mean corpuscular volume (MCV) of 65 fL, and a red cell distribution width (RDW) of 30. He has no evidence of iron deficiency or thalassemia. The peripheral smear shows marked hypochromia and microcytosis occasionally with inclusions. The bone marrow aspirate shows abundant ring sideroblasts.</p><p>XLSA is viewed as an X-linked recessive disorder. However, in contrast to many X-linked disorders that present predominantly in males, up to one-third of cases of XLSA occur in females, with anemia onset typically at middle age or later. This high incidence in females relative to other X-linked disorders is attributed to acquired skewed X-chromosome inactivation in hematopoietic cells with advancing age. Some experts have suggested that the terms dominant and recessive not be used for X-linked disorders, because multiple mechanisms can result in expression of X-linked traits in females, including skewed X-inactivation, clonal expansion, and somatic mosaicism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sideroblastic-anemias-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>XLSA is caused by heterozygous mutations in the <a href=\"http://omim.org/entry/301300&amp;token=O25AxH2ZrpTPG8o+GEGTWAgY4rg0RtTcyNY1ENqa9k3WiofqE9+2pwgh3EgRyWp5&amp;TOPIC_ID=7123\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">ALAS2</a> gene, which encodes the erythroid-specific form of the heme biosynthetic enzyme 5-aminolevulinate synthase (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F68187\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68187 \">figure 1</a>). Because <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b6-pyridoxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin B6</a> is the essential co-factor of this enzyme, the anemia sometimes responds to vitamin B6 supplements by enhancing the impaired function of certain <em>ALAS2</em> mutants. Among all types of sideroblastic anemia, this response to vitamin B6 is thus unique to XLSA. The pathophysiology of XLSA is discussed in more detail separately.</p><p>The anemia in XLSA is of quite variable severity. It is always microcytic in males but normocytic or macrocytic in most females. The explanation for this difference is that in females, skewed X-chromosome inactivation in hematopoietic cells in the bone marrow leads to predominantly nonviable red blood cell (RBC) precursors usually bearing a severe mutant <em>ALAS2</em> allele (that succumb to intramedullary hemolysis) while the peripheral blood RBCs represent the progeny of the RBC precursors bearing the normal <em>ALAS2</em> allele, which undergo accelerated release from the bone marrow, mediated by increased erythropoietin drive of anemic hypoxia. This often produces macrocytosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sideroblastic-anemias-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>In cases where the anemia is mild, the condition may not be discovered until later in life (and may be attributed to a myelodysplastic syndrome). The severity of the anemia usually remains stable over many years; however, in some individuals it worsens over time. Disease worsening over time may be attributed to one or more of the following, several of which relate to reduced <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b6-pyridoxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin B6</a> (pyridoxine) availability (for XLSA that responds to vitamin B6 supplementation):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Discontinuation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b6-pyridoxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin B6</a> that had been part of a multivitamin preparation the patient no longer takes.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Changes in dietary habits that lead to reduced intake of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b6-pyridoxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin B6</a>.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age-associated alterations in pyridoxine metabolism.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age-associated skewing of the X chromosome inactivation pattern (lyonization) in hematopoietic cells in women, leading to progressive inactivation of the normal <em>ALAS2</em> allele and greater relative expression of the mutant allele [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sideroblastic-anemias-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-7</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The commonly associated iron overload, which may further impair erythroblast mitochondrial function and heme synthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sideroblastic-anemias-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p>XLSA with ataxia <span class=\"nowrap\">(XLSA/A)</span> is a syndromic X-linked disorder caused by mutations in a different gene, <a href=\"http://omim.org/entry/300135&amp;token=O25AxH2ZrpTPG8o+GEGTWJEuA7UM12IZZAL07UmH1c2m6qILwJJcMyhatWBWviDb&amp;TOPIC_ID=7123\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">ABCB7</a>, which encodes an ATP-binding cassette with a postulated role in exporting iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters from mitochondria for cytosolic Fe-S cluster-containing proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sideroblastic-anemias-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

In such cases, iron studies show a reduced or normal serum iron, and a low ferritin concentration, consistent with a concomitant iron deficiency state.</p><p>It is important to note that ring sideroblasts are not detectable in iron-stained bone marrow biopsy sections, as the erythroblast iron becomes leeched out during the tissue processing.

Like sideroblastic anemias, megaloblastic anemias present with anemia, low reticulocyte count, and sometimes neurologic findings, which may be quite variable. Unlike sideroblastic anemia, megaloblastic anemia is associated with megaloblastic changes rather than ring sideroblasts in the bone marrow, although ferritin sideroblasts (sideroblasts in which the granules do not encircle the nucleus) may be seen. If vitamin B12 or folate deficiency is responsible, laboratory testing in megaloblastic anemia shows the deficiency, whereas in sideroblastic anemia deficiency of copper may be found. The drugs implicated in megaloblastic anemia differ from those implicated in sideroblastic anemia.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-patients-with-hereditary-hemochromatosis#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of patients with hereditary hemochromatosis&quot;, section on 'Phlebotomy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Iron chelation therapy</strong> &ndash; In patients who have more severe anemia, and in those who require regular RBC transfusions and thus cannot undergo phlebotomy, chelation of the excess iron is undertaken with an iron chelating agent. Details are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iron-chelators-choice-of-agent-dosing-and-adverse-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Iron chelators: Choice of agent, dosing, and adverse effects&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3571748891\"><span class=\"h2\">Avoidance of splenectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There has been a temptation to perform splenectomy in patients with severe anemia and a significant degree of splenomegaly with suspected splenic sequestration of RBCs. However, this procedure is invariably complicated by postoperative thromboembolic events and often a fatal outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sideroblastic-anemias-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/96-99\" class=\"abstract_t\">96-99</a>]. Factors other than persistent thrombocytosis appear to play a role; control of the platelet count and anticoagulant therapy usually are not effective. Thus, splenectomy is considered to be <strong>contraindicated </strong>in the congenital sideroblastic anemias save for a case of clinical urgency such as traumatic splenic rupture or otherwise untreatable splenic abscess. We also suggest avoiding splenectomy in individuals with the long-lived myelodysplastic syndrome variants MDS-RS-SLD (previously called RARS) and <span class=\"nowrap\">MDS/MPN-RS-T</span> (previously called RARS-T). (See <a href=\"#H3370785817\" class=\"local\">'MDS/MPN variants'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H391315375\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic counseling and testing of first degree relatives</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with inherited sideroblastic anemia, we educate the patient or family about the disease and relevant inheritance pattern. We also obtain a full family history and a complete blood count (CBC) on each parent and sibling. When the genetic defect has been identified in the index case, it can be easily confirmed in any affected family members by genetic (DNA) testing.</p><p>In the X-linked anemias, we advise all young women who are candidates for having a mutation to be tested for carrier status. Testing of the parents can be used to determine whether the defect in the proband has been transmitted or is a de novo mutation.</p><p>In autosomal recessive forms, the genetic status of the parents of an affected and genetically identified offspring can be confirmed and used for counseling regarding future pregnancies, including consideration of prenatal testing or preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD).

These can also be categorized by red blood cell (RBC) size (microcytic or <span class=\"nowrap\">normocytic/macrocytic)</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F108664\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef108664 \">table 2</a>) and by inheritance pattern (X-linked, autosomal, or mitochondrial). X-linked sideroblastic anemia (XLSA) is the most common congenital sideroblastic anemia. Although it is an X-linked disorder, up to one-third of cases occur in females. This and other congenital forms are discussed above. (See <a href=\"#H24895186\" class=\"local\">'Congenital sideroblastic anemias'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acquired sideroblastic anemias include clonal bone marrow disorders that are classified within the rubric of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), as well as reversible conditions attributed to certain medications, excessive alcohol use, or copper deficiency. (See <a href=\"#H750627791\" class=\"local\">'Acquired sideroblastic anemias'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sideroblastic anemia is often considered in the differential diagnosis of unexplained anemia after more common causes have been excluded. The diagnosis of <strong>all </strong>sideroblastic anemias is made by identifying the telltale ring sideroblasts on the bone marrow aspirate smear. Distinction among the specific forms of sideroblastic anemia involves evaluation of clinical features and laboratory testing, often followed by genetic testing. (See <a href=\"#H1120573638\" class=\"local\">'Overview of diagnostic issues'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In an infant or child, a congenital sideroblastic anemia may be suspected based on a known family history, clinical features that suggest a syndromic condition, or lack of another diagnosis. Diagnostic clues based on clinical findings and RBC size are presented above. It is worth noting that the associated clinical features in the syndromic congenital sideroblastic anemias may be subtle or not yet fully manifest at presentation to be recognized, and thus some of the inherited forms may not be correctly diagnosed until later in life. (See <a href=\"#H4205029427\" class=\"local\">'Infant/child evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In adults, an acquired sideroblastic anemia is much more common than an inherited form, although the diagnosis of a congenital type has not infrequently been delayed until adulthood. The two typical presentations in adults are those in which the clinical history gives a clue to a reversible cause, and those for whom the bone marrow aspirate performed for unexplained anemia reveals ring sideroblasts. Almost all of the acquired sideroblastic anemias are associated with normocytic or macrocytic RBCs rather than microcytosis. For individuals with suspected <span class=\"nowrap\">MDS/MPN</span> variants, it is important to exclude other causes of sideroblastic anemia (eg, copper deficiency, medications, XLSA in females). (See <a href=\"#H4025036272\" class=\"local\">'Adult evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Laboratory testing involves review of the complete blood count (CBC), peripheral blood smear, and bone marrow aspirate smear (including iron stain). <span class=\"nowrap\">Molecular/genetic</span> testing may be appropriate when the bone marrow shows ring sideroblasts and a congenital sideroblastic anemia or <span class=\"nowrap\">MDS/MPN</span> variant is suspected. (See <a href=\"#H1188336925\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory and bone marrow findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of sideroblastic anemia includes other inherited and acquired anemias, several of which are associated with neurologic findings (eg, megaloblastic anemias, Wilson disease, lead poisoning), and other causes of RBC inclusions that resemble Pappenheimer bodies. (See <a href=\"#H2099056387\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management of sideroblastic anemias depends on the severity of the anemia, whether reversible abnormalities are present, and whether the sideroblastic anemia is responsive to a specific agent such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-b6-pyridoxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vitamin B6</a>. Patients may require additional testing such as iron studies. Management of anemia and iron overload are critical. Splenectomy is avoided. Genetic counseling and testing of first degree relatives is appropriate in those with inherited forms.
