Impaired catabolism of tyrosine is a feature of several acquired and genetic disorders that may result in elevated plasma tyrosine concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-tyrosine-metabolism/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TYROSINE METABOLISM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tyrosine degradation is catalyzed by a series of five enzymatic reactions that yield acetoacetate, which is ketogenic, and the Krebs cycle intermediate fumarate, which is glucogenic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77852\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef77852 \">algorithm 1</a>). The hepatocyte and renal proximal tubules are the only two cell types that express the complete pathway and contain sufficient quantities of all enzymes required for tyrosine catabolism.</p><p>Four autosomal recessive disorders result from deficiencies in specific enzymes in the tyrosine catabolic pathway: hereditary tyrosinemia (HT) types 1, 2, and 3, and alkaptonuria (AKU). Each disorder is assigned a number on the <a href=\"http://www.omim.org/&amp;token=G+kOOgscg7PQzd0gXq5S9x/zLM1otKVlXe08jt6KdIg=&amp;TOPIC_ID=2935\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) website</a>. Except for AKU, these disorders result in elevated blood tyrosine levels.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypertyrosinemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Normal plasma tyrosine concentrations are 30 to 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L</span>. Values &gt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L</span> are considered elevated. However, clinical manifestations typically do not become apparent until plasma levels exceed 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L</span>.</p><p>Hypertyrosinemia is detected by quantitative measurement of plasma amino acids. This test usually is performed to evaluate otherwise unexplained liver disease or neurologic abnormalities, such as seizures or developmental delay. Hypertyrosinemia also may be detected on a plasma specimen obtained to investigate elevated urinary tyrosine, seen in the renal Fanconi syndrome (which is manifested by impaired proximal tubular function). HT types 1, 2, and 3 may be detected by expanded newborn metabolic screening available in some states.</p><p>Hypertyrosinemia is caused by a variety of genetic and acquired disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60322\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60322 \">table 1</a>). They include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inherited deficiencies of enzymes in the degradation pathway</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Transient tyrosinemia of the newborn</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Liver disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Miscellaneous disorders including scurvy and hyperthyroidism</p><p/><p>The most important diagnostic consideration in the evaluation of hypertyrosinemia is the presence or absence of liver disease. If liver disease is present, additional tests must be performed urgently to detect HT type 1, a potentially lethal disorder that requires immediate treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">HEREDITARY TYROSINEMIA TYPE 1</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT1, MIM# 276700), also known as hepatorenal tyrosinemia, is the most severe disorder of tyrosine metabolism. HT1 occurs in 1 in 12,000 to 1 in 100,000 individuals of Northern European descent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-tyrosine-metabolism/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">HT1 pathophysiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT1) is caused by deficiency of fumarylacetoacetate hydrolase (FAH), the last enzyme in the pathway of tyrosine catabolism (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77852\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef77852 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-tyrosine-metabolism/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Fumarylacetoacetate (FAA), the substrate for FAH in the tyrosine pathway, accumulates in FAH-deficient hepatocytes and proximal renal tubular cells, resulting in liver and kidney damage.</p><p>FAA causes oxidative damage to cells by reacting with glutathione and sulfhydryl groups of proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-tyrosine-metabolism/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. FAA is also mutagenic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-tyrosine-metabolism/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>], although it is not known whether it causes direct or indirect damage to DNA. The mutagenicity of FAA is thought to be the cause of the high rate of hepatocellular carcinoma in HT1.</p><p>The oxidative and DNA damage caused by FAA leads to either cell death or a profound perturbation of gene expression, especially in the liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-tyrosine-metabolism/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. As a result, many metabolic processes, including gluconeogenesis, detoxification of ammonia, and synthesis of secreted proteins, are impaired. Impaired protein synthesis in FAH-deficient hepatocytes leads to a marked reduction in tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT), the first enzyme in tyrosine degradation, resulting in the elevated plasma tyrosine levels typical of the disorder. Tyrosine itself is not toxic to the liver or kidney but causes dermatologic, ophthalmologic, and possibly neurodevelopmental problems.</p><p>FAA has a short intracellular half-life and thus is not found in body fluids of HT1 patients. The principal metabolites of FAA, succinylacetoacetate (SAA) and succinylacetone (SA), are released into the circulation and can be measured for diagnosis.</p><p>Increased levels of these metabolites can lead to secondary biochemical alterations in HT1. As an example, SA is a potent inhibitor of aminolevulinate (ALA) dehydratase (porphobilinogen synthase), the first step of heme biosynthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-tyrosine-metabolism/abstract/3,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,9,10</a>]. This can result in ALA dehydratase porphyria with neurologic symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-tyrosine-metabolism/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Circulating SA also may impair proximal ALA reabsorption, which contributes to the increase in ALA excretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-tyrosine-metabolism/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ala-dehydratase-porphyria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ALA dehydratase porphyria&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">HT1 genetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mode of inheritance for hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT1) is autosomal recessive. The gene encoding FAH has been mapped to human chromosome 15q23-q25, cloned, and sequenced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-tyrosine-metabolism/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p>HT1 occurs more commonly in some ethnic groups, most notably in the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean region of Quebec. In that population, the carrier rate and prevalence at birth were estimated at 1 in 20 to 25 inhabitants and 1 in 1846 livebirths, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-tyrosine-metabolism/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. A splice mutation was identified in the <em>FAH</em> gene in all patients from Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean and in 28 percent of patients from other regions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-tyrosine-metabolism/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. A stop mutation is common in Finnish patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-tyrosine-metabolism/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">HT1 clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT1) is characterized by severe, progressive liver disease and renal tubular dysfunction. The latter typically is manifest as the Fanconi syndrome with renal tubular acidosis, aminoaciduria, and hypophosphatemia (due to phosphate wasting) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-tyrosine-metabolism/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Features of rickets often are present.</p><p>Most patients present in early infancy with failure to thrive and hepatomegaly. Some develop conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. An often marked elevation in serum alpha fetoprotein (AFP) is common in HT1. Studies in newborns have shown that cord blood AFP is elevated at a time when tyrosine levels are still normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-tyrosine-metabolism/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. This observation suggests that the liver disease begins prenatally, as does the common finding of nodularity or cirrhosis in affected neonates. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-cholestasis-in-neonates-and-young-infants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of cholestasis in neonates and young infants&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Progression of the liver disease can be chronic or acute, with rapid deterioration and early death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-tyrosine-metabolism/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Liver dysfunction commonly results in hypoglycemia and coagulation abnormalities. Serum aminotransferase levels typically are only mildly elevated and often disproportionately low compared with the marked degree of coagulopathy. Complications of liver failure, including jaundice, ascites, and hemorrhage, often develop.</p><p>The chronic form consists of a mixed micronodular and macronodular cirrhosis. The risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma is high in untreated survivors, occurring in as many as 37 percent of untreated patients older than two years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-tyrosine-metabolism/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Cancer formation is thought to be caused by the mutagenicity of FAA.</p><p>Both the acute and chronic forms can occur in affected siblings or other patients with identical genotypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-tyrosine-metabolism/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Intrafamilial variability in the severity of HT1 may be caused in part by somatic mosaicism. Immunohistologic analysis of liver in some patients shows enzyme activity in some regenerating nodules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-tyrosine-metabolism/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. In these areas of regeneration, one of the mutant alleles may revert spontaneously to the normal genotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-tyrosine-metabolism/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Reversion to the normal allele in some individuals may be associated with milder liver disease, but the risk for liver cancer remains [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-tyrosine-metabolism/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Severe neurologic manifestations are common in poorly controlled HT1 and contribute to morbidity and mortality. In one study of 48 children with tyrosinemia identified with neonatal screening, neurologic crises resembling the crises of the neuropathic porphyrias occurred in 20 (42 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-tyrosine-metabolism/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. These acute episodes of peripheral neuropathy were characterized by severe pain with extensor hypertonia (75 percent), vomiting or paralytic ileus (69 percent), muscle weakness (29 percent), and self-mutilation (8 percent). Eight children required mechanical ventilation because of paralysis. Between crises, most patients regained normal function. Electrophysiologic studies in seven patients and neuromuscular biopsies in three patients showed axonal degeneration and secondary demyelination. Intellectual disability is not a feature.</p><p>Approximately 30 percent of patients display cardiomyopathy at the time of diagnosis, with interventricular septal hypertrophy being the most common finding. This disease manifestation is reversible with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitisinone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">nitisinone</a> therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-tyrosine-metabolism/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p>If untreated, patients with HT1 have a significantly shortened lifespan. Patients may die of acute liver failure before the second year after birth or from chronic liver failure or hepatocellular carcinoma before the end of the second decade.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">HT1 laboratory diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most important diagnostic test for hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT1) is the measurement of SA either in urine or in blood. Many newborn screening programs perform sensitive SA measurements on dried blood spots and confirmatory testing. Elevation of SA is pathognomonic for the disorder. Molecular testing for disease-causing mutations is available through multiple laboratories, but treatment should not be delayed until molecular confirmation is available. Affected patients usually also have elevated plasma concentrations of AFP, tyrosine, and methionine and excrete tyrosyl compounds in the urine.</p><p>Newborn screening for HT1 is available in regions with high prevalence, including Quebec, and in most states in the United States. Tandem mass spectrometry can reliably detect diagnostic quantities of SA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-tyrosine-metabolism/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=newborn-screening\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Newborn screening&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">HT1 management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dietary treatment, consisting of foods with low or absent phenylalanine and tyrosine and restriction of natural protein, results in decreased tyrosine levels. However, this approach does not stop the production of SA, prevent the progression of liver or renal disease, or reduce the risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma or neurologic abnormalities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Nitisinone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The medical treatment of choice is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitisinone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">nitisinone</a>, formerly known as NTBC, which inhibits 4-OH phenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPD), an early step in the tyrosine degradation pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-tyrosine-metabolism/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. This treatment reduces metabolic flow through the pathway and limits formation of the toxic compounds FAA and SA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77852\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef77852 \">algorithm 1</a>). Nitisinone should be started as early as possible (ie, immediately after diagnosis of HT1 by blood or urine measurement of SA).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3187853994\"><span class=\"h4\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since the first <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitisinone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">nitisinone</a> trial in 1991, approximately 90 percent of treated patients have improved clinically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-tyrosine-metabolism/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. Treatment started at an early age reduces the risk of early development of hepatocellular carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-tyrosine-metabolism/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], although longer follow-up is needed to determine if the effect persists throughout life. Therapy with nitisinone also decreases the need for orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT), particularly when started in early infancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-tyrosine-metabolism/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. In addition, renal function is preserved in patients treated with nitisinone who undergo OLT. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Liver transplantation'</a> below.)</p><p>The long-term risk of developing neurologic problems on <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitisinone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">nitisinone</a> therapy is unknown. This is a concern because neurologic complications develop in some patients with inherited HPD deficiency, the same enzyme affected by nitisinone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-tyrosine-metabolism/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. A study of long-term outcomes of nitisinone treatment in France showed cognitive impairment in 35 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-tyrosine-metabolism/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. A subsequent Dutch study demonstrated that some patients experience cognitive decline over time despite nitisinone treatment and despite dietary control of tyrosine levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-tyrosine-metabolism/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. It is not known whether this phenotype is related to elevated tyrosine, phenylalanine deficiency, or caused by other factors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3611528182\"><span class=\"h4\">Dosing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A typical starting dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitisinone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">nitisinone</a> is 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day, divided into a morning and evening dose and given orally. Because nitisinone increases plasma tyrosine levels, patients should have a protein-restricted diet that is low in phenylalanine and tyrosine. The dietary protein intake is varied to keep the plasma tyrosine level &lt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L</span>.</p><p>If the biochemical parameters (except plasma SA) have not normalized within one month of starting therapy (see <a href=\"#H1555034679\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> below), the dose should be increased to 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day. The dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitisinone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">nitisinone</a> should be adjusted to completely suppress excretion of SA. However, it may take as long as three months for complete suppression of SA to occur. A dose of 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span> may be needed, especially in infants. However, this dose should be considered maximal. A general target for blood level of nitisinone is 50 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L</span>. In older individuals, therapeutic blood levels of nitisinone can often be achieved with doses &lt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span>. Monitoring of the blood levels is recommended for dose adjustment and also for monitoring compliance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1555034679\"><span class=\"h4\">Monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Metabolic monitoring includes the measurement of plasma amino acids, blood or urinary SA, liver function tests, complete blood count (CBC) with differential, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitisinone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">nitisinone</a> levels, and serum AFP (which increases further with hepatocellular carcinoma). Metabolic monitoring is performed monthly for the first year, then every three months throughout childhood. The CBC is monitored because some patients develop hematologic abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-tyrosine-metabolism/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>], especially leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. Serum AFP can take many months to normalize after nitisinone therapy is started. It is important to monitor the trend of the decline, which should be continuously downward. If AFP levels off in a range above normal or begins to increase, an evaluation of possible hepatocarcinoma should be initiated. In one study, AFP levels did not normalize in approximately one-third of patients, even after one year of nitisinone treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-tyrosine-metabolism/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>Ophthalmologic examination and hepatic imaging (magnetic resonance imaging is preferred) should be performed annually.</p><p>Some patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitisinone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">nitisinone</a> have reduced levels of blood phenylalanine levels, raising concerns about negative effects on growth and neurologic development from lack of this essential amino acid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-tyrosine-metabolism/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The clinical significance of this observation is unclear, but supplementation of phenylalanine in the diet is suggested when two independent measurements show phenylalanine levels of &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromoles/L</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-tyrosine-metabolism/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Liver transplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>OLT is performed in patients with persistent liver failure who do not respond to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitisinone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">nitisinone</a> therapy or have hepatic malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-tyrosine-metabolism/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>]. In one series of eight patients transplanted at a median age of 64 months, plasma tyrosine and AFP returned to normal, urinary SA decreased, and, if present, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy resolved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-tyrosine-metabolism/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Two children died, one from a nonfunctioning graft and one from chronic rejection. Late complications in the six survivors included renal dysfunction in three and lymphoproliferative disease of the iris in one. Renal tubular function remains abnormal in many transplanted patients, and careful monitoring of kidney function is therefore recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-tyrosine-metabolism/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Plasma and urinary SA levels are not completely normalized after transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-tyrosine-metabolism/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>], but the clinical significance of this finding is unknown. OLT is not predicted to prevent the accumulation of mutagenic and toxic FAA in renal tubules. More extensive long-term studies are needed to determine whether renal pathology (progressive tubular disease or renal cancer) can be prevented by OLT in the absence of nitisinone treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">HEREDITARY TYROSINEMIA TYPE 2</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hereditary tyrosinemia type 2 (HT2, MIM# 276600), also known as oculocutaneous tyrosinemia or Richner-Hanhart syndrome, is characterized by early development of eye and skin abnormalities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">HT2 pathophysiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hereditary tyrosinemia type 2 (HT2) is caused by deficiency of tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT), the first enzyme in the tyrosine degradation pathway (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77852\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef77852 \">algorithm 1</a>).

Early dietary intervention may prevent cognitive impairment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-tyrosine-metabolism/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h1\">HEREDITARY TYROSINEMIA TYPE 3</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hereditary tyrosinemia type 3 (HT3, MIM# 276710) is a rare, autosomal recessive disorder caused by deficiency of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPD), the second step in the tyrosine catabolism pathway (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77852\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef77852 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-tyrosine-metabolism/abstract/35,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,47</a>]. Numerous mutations have been identified in the <em>HPD</em> gene on chromosome 12q24 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-tyrosine-metabolism/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Most affected patients have neurologic dysfunction, including ataxia, seizures, and mild psychomotor retardation, but no other systemic involvement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60732\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60732 \">table 2</a>). The majority of reported cases have mental retardation, but a causative relationship between HPD deficiency and neurologic problems has not been conclusively demonstrated. Ascertainment bias may account for the apparent correlation. Patients with normal psychomotor development have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-tyrosine-metabolism/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>The diagnosis is confirmed by detection of mutations in the <em>HPD</em> gene in cultured skin fibroblasts or blood. Prenatal detection is available using this technique.</p><p>Plasma tyrosine levels are elevated in this disorder but typically remain below 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L</span> and therefore usually do not cause corneal ulcers or hyperkeratosis. Treatment consists of a diet low in tyrosine and phenylalanine, although whether this diet can prevent or reverse the neurologic symptoms is uncertain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">ALKAPTONURIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alkaptonuria (AKU, MIM# 203500) is an autosomal recessive disorder that results from deficient activity of homogentisic acid dioxygenase (HGD, HGO), the third enzyme in tyrosine degradation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-tyrosine-metabolism/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. The description of AKU by Garrod in 1902 led to recognition of the concept of a single enzyme deficiency resulting in lifelong disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-tyrosine-metabolism/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. The gene encoding HGD has been mapped to chromosome 3q21-q23 and mutations identified in patients with AKU [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-tyrosine-metabolism/abstract/52,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">52,53</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>HGD deficiency results in elevated levels of homogentisic acid (HGA), which polymerizes, forming a pigment that is deposited in connective tissue throughout the body (ochronosis) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60616\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60616 \">picture 1</a>). Affected patients usually are asymptomatic in childhood.</p><p>In affected babies, urine in a diaper may darken and can turn almost black after several hours (black nappies). During the third decade, deposits of the brownish or bluish pigment become apparent, typically first in the ear cartilage and sclerae. Additional pigment is deposited in the large joints and the spine, especially the lumbosacral region. Calcification of multiple intervertebral discs is a characteristic radiographic finding. The development of ochronotic arthritis results in limitation of motion and often complete ankylosis, resembling rheumatoid arthritis or osteoarthritis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F60732\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60732 \">table 2</a>). Axillary and inguinal areas may have a brownish discoloration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-tyrosine-metabolism/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Perspiration can stain clothing in affected patients.</p><p>The natural history of AKU was evaluated in a study of 58 patients, ages 4 to 80 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-tyrosine-metabolism/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Arthropathy was common, and one-half of the patients had replacement of one knee, hip, or shoulder before 55 years of age. Renal stones developed in 16 patients (27 percent) at a mean age of 64 years. The mean ages for detection of cardiac valve involvement and coronary artery calcification were 54 and 59 years, respectively. In another series, aortic valve disease was common in patients over 40 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-tyrosine-metabolism/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The disorder is characterized by the excretion of urine that appears normal when fresh but turns dark brown or black if left standing or after alkalinization. The dark color is caused by oxidation of HGA, and AKU has also been called black urine disease. Cloth diapers that are washed in alkaline solutions will have dark brown staining.</p><p>Although the discoloration of urine in AKU is apparent in infancy, the diagnosis usually is made in adults during routine urinalysis or investigation of arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-tyrosine-metabolism/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. In the natural history study cited above, AKU was diagnosed before one year of age in 12 of 58 patients (21 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-tyrosine-metabolism/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. In the remaining patients, the mean age at diagnosis was 29 years.</p><p>Levels of HGA are increased in blood, urine, and tissue samples.

The arthropathy mostly is not reversible, although diet may prevent further progression. Ascorbic acid, which inhibits the enzyme that catalyses the oxidation of HGA to the polymer with affinity for collagen, is given, but its efficacy has not been demonstrated for ochronosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-tyrosine-metabolism/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitisinone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Nitisinone</a>, which inhibits the second enzyme in the tyrosine catabolic pathway, decreased urinary HGA levels by 95 percent in one short-term study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-tyrosine-metabolism/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. However, no clinical benefits (hip total range of motion and other measures of musculoskeletal function) were demonstrated in a randomized trial of AKU patients who already had significant arthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disorders-of-tyrosine-metabolism/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].

The etiology of this disorder is immaturity of 4-OH phenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPD), which is involved in an early step of tyrosine degradation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77852\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef77852 \">algorithm 1</a>). Transient immaturity of this enzyme, the gene for which is mutated in hereditary tyrosinemia type 3 (HT3), occurs in approximately 10 percent of preterm infants and some term infants. Tyrosine levels are measured in most newborn screening programs, and this condition will cause an abnormal newborn screening result. Testing for hereditary tyrosinemia type 1 (HT1) and hepatic injury should be done in all cases of elevated tyrosine. If succinylacetone (SA) is absent and liver functions are normal, tyrosine levels should be monitored longitudinally. In transient tyrosinemia, levels should normalize within a few weeks. If this does not occur, an evaluation for hereditary tyrosinemia type 2 (HT2) and HT3 should be initiated.</p><p>This disorder rarely is a problem with modern neonatal management. In the past, affected patients could develop lethargy, poor feeding, metabolic acidosis, and prolonged jaundice.
