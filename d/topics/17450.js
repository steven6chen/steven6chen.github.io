VAT is generally characterized by clinical signs of respiratory tract infection (eg, fever, cough, increased sputum production) without radiographic evidence of pneumonia.

Presence of microbes with morphology different from those identified in recent specimens (eg, current gram-positive cocci versus past gram-negative rods, and vice versa) raises suspicion for new bacterial infection over simple colonization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tracheobronchitis-associated-with-tracheostomy-tubes-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. A negative Gram stain may be somewhat reassuring when there is otherwise low suspicion of airway infection. A positive Gram stain alone without other clinical data suggesting the presence of infection may reflect colonization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tracheobronchitis-associated-with-tracheostomy-tubes-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p>Quantitation (ie, &ge;25 per low power field) or semiquantitation (ie, few to many, 2+ to 4+) of polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) on the Gram stain also may have utility in some cases.

Current results are less likely to differ from those of past tracheal aspirate cultures obtained within the past 30 days than when longer periods of time have elapsed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2440637790\"><span class=\"h3\">Viral testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In children who are chronically tracheostomy-dependent, viral lower respiratory tract infections (LRI) are common causes of purulent secretions and acute respiratory symptoms. Thus, viral testing of tracheal aspirates (eg, with multiplex polymerase chain reaction tests, rapid viral antigen tests, or viral culture) should be routinely performed as part of the initial evaluation of acute respiratory exacerbations in this population. In contrast, viral infections less commonly cause nosocomial VAT in children who are intubated in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU). In this setting, viral testing is not routinely part of the initial evaluation, but may be useful if the initial evaluation is nondiagnostic or if there is known exposure to a viral pathogen.</p><p>Viral LRIs in children with artificial airways are generally caused by the same respiratory viruses that affect children without tracheostomies (eg, influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, parainfluenza, human metapneumovirus). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=seasonal-influenza-in-children-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Seasonal influenza in children: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=respiratory-syncytial-virus-infection-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Respiratory syncytial virus infection: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-pathogenesis-of-rhinovirus-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and pathogenesis of rhinovirus infections&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Results of viral testing should be interpreted in conjunction with the clinical picture and results of the bacterial culture. Interpretation is fairly straightforward if the bacterial culture is negative and viral testing is positive, consistent with viral LRI. However, if both the bacterial culture and viral testing are positive, this may represent either viral LRI complicated by bacterial superinfection or viral LRI in the setting of chronic airway colonization. As previously described, quantitative culture results and review of prior tracheal cultures can be helpful in distinguishing between these (see <a href=\"#H25531134\" class=\"local\">'Culture'</a> above). The patient's clinical picture should also be taken into consideration. If the patient is acutely ill with considerable symptomatology (eg, high fevers, needing increased respiratory support), bacterial superinfection is more likely.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Bronchoscopy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although rarely required in the routine evaluation of VAT in children with artificial airways, bronchoscopy can be used to confirm or exclude the diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tracheobronchitis-associated-with-tracheostomy-tubes-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Increased secretions also may occur from viral infections or other mechanisms unrelated to the presence of infection. Respiratory distress may be readily evident in some children but masked in others, especially when sedated while on mechanical ventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tracheobronchitis-associated-with-tracheostomy-tubes-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-children/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].

Chest auscultation is often unreliable in ventilated patients (eg, audible crackles may not indicate infection, infection that is present may not generate crackles audible over ventilator-related noise). Similarly, fever and other adjunctive tests such as peripheral blood white blood cell count (WBC) are not specific to respiratory tract infections or bacterial versus viral respiratory tract infections.

Alternatively, antimicrobial therapy may be continued until a few days after resolution of respiratory tract symptoms. In a retrospective study of 118 intubated children with VAT, the likelihood of progressing to VAP was similar in those who were treated with a prolonged course of antibiotics (&ge;7 days) compared with shorter courses (hazard ratio [HR] 1.08; 95% CI 0.4-2.9) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tracheobronchitis-associated-with-tracheostomy-tubes-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-children/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

This could be due to relatively small sample sizes of the studies with probable inclusion of many episodes that were not true bacterial VAT. </p><p>Several studies have identified an association between VAT and both longer duration of mechanical ventilation and longer pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) length of stay (LOS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tracheobronchitis-associated-with-tracheostomy-tubes-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-children/abstract/8,9,12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9,12,13</a>]. The directional causality of this association is unclear. It is possible that VAT leads to a need for more prolonged mechanical ventilation and thus longer PICU LOS. However, it is also likely that children with underlying conditions requiring longer durations of mechanical ventilation are at greater risk of developing VAT. Severity of illness and use of <span class=\"nowrap\">pressors/inotropes</span> was associated with occurrence of VAT in pediatric trauma patients in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tracheobronchitis-associated-with-tracheostomy-tubes-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>There are few published reports of outcomes following tracheobronchitis among children who are chronically tracheotomy-dependent. In our experience, most such children recover from a single episode of tracheobronchitis without lasting sequelae. Frequent or recurrent respiratory tract infections likely contribute to morbidity and mortality in this population; however, recurrent pneumonias play a more important role than do tracheal infections. In a study from a single institution of 142 tracheostomy-dependent children followed for an average of 4.1 years, there were 29 episodes of tracheobronchitis among 25 patients (18 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tracheobronchitis-associated-with-tracheostomy-tubes-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-children/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

In addition, routine tracheotomy tube changes and local stoma care are important preventive measures in tracheotomy-dependent children since tracheotomy tubes may be a source for continuing bacterial contamination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tracheobronchitis-associated-with-tracheostomy-tubes-and-endotracheal-intubation-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Data on the effectiveness of these measures for prevention of ventilator-associated tracheobronchitis (VAT) in children are limited as described below.
