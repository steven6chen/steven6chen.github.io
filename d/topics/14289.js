It might start when you are aroused, but then it does not go away. Priapism can be very painful and serious. It is not related to having sex or wanting to have sex.</p><p>There are 2 main types of priapism:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ischemic</strong> &ndash; This type of priapism happens when blood stays trapped in the penis. &quot;Ischemic&quot; means that the blood in the penis does not contain the normal amount of oxygen. It can be caused by many things, including certain medicines, blood diseases (such as sickle cell anemia), cocaine use, spider bites, and spinal cord injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Priapism that happens again and again, also called &quot;stuttering&quot; priapism, is a type of ischemic priapism. It can happen in men or boys with sickle cell anemia. It begins with brief erections that often start during sleep and continue when the person wakes up. As time goes on, this begins to happen more often and the erection lasts longer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Ischemic priapism that lasts more than 4 hours can cause long-term damage to the penis. It can lead to a condition called &quot;erectile dysfunction&quot; (also called &quot;impotence&quot;), which is when you have problems getting or keeping an erection. The longer an erection lasts, the more likely it is to cause damage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Nonischemic</strong> &ndash; This type of priapism happens when blood keeps flowing into the penis, keeping it erect, but not always fully hard. &quot;Nonischemic&quot; means that the blood in the penis contains the normal amount of oxygen It is often due to an injury of some kind and is usually not as painful as ischemic priapism. This type of priapism is less likely to cause lasting damage to the penis.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29306339\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of priapism?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms depend on the kind of priapism. The symptoms of ischemic priapism are a very hard erection that is often painful. Nonischemic priapism is less painful and the erection is often not as hard.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29306354\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes! See your doctor or nurse right away if you have any erection that lasts longer than 2 to 4 hours. This can be a serious medical emergency.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29306369\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. Your doctor or nurse can tell if you have priapism by learning about your symptoms and doing an exam. But he or she might need to do tests to find out which kind of priapism you have. These tests include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood gas analysis &ndash; In this test, the doctor takes a sample of blood from your penis and checks the blood to see how much oxygen is in it.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Doppler ultrasound &ndash; In this test the doctor uses sound waves to look at how the blood is flowing in your penis.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29306384\"><span class=\"h1\">How is priapism treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment depends on the type of priapism you have.</p><p>If you have ischemic priapism and your erection has lasted longer than 4 hours, your doctor will probably use a needle to drain some of the blood from your penis. Then he or she will inject a medicine into your penis that will make the erection go down. The doctor might need to repeat the injection until the erection is fully gone. If you have severe pain, your doctor can prescribe a strong pain medicine.</p><p>If these treatments do not work, your doctor might recommend surgery. There are different types of surgery available. Your doctor will talk to you about which is best for you.</p><p>Nonischemic priapism often goes away on its own without treatment, even though it might last hours or days. If you have nonischemic priapism that does not go away, your doctor might do a procedure to treat it. But this is rarely needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29306399\"><span class=\"h1\">Can priapism be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Priapism caused by sickle cell anemia can sometimes be prevented. If you have sickle cell anemia, your doctor will work with you to find the best treatment for your situation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29306416\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sex-problems-in-men-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Sex problems in men (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sickle-cell-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Sickle cell disease (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
