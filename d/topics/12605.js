Urothelial (formerly called transitional cell) carcinoma is the predominant histologic type in the United States and Europe, where it accounts for approximately 90 percent of all bladder cancers. In other areas of the world, non-urothelial carcinomas are more frequent. Less commonly, urothelial cancers can arise in the renal pelvis, ureter, or urethra. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-risk-factors-of-urothelial-transitional-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and risk factors of urothelial (transitional cell) carcinoma of the bladder&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>The spectrum of urothelial bladder cancer at presentation includes non-muscle invasive, muscle invasive, and metastatic disease. The extent of disease reflects its natural history and determines treatment and prognosis.</p><p>This topic provides an overview of the initial approach to and management of urothelial carcinoma of the bladder. More detailed discussions of specific issues are found in associated topics, as indicated below.</p><p>The management of urothelial tumors arising at other sites is discussed separately, as are other types of bladder cancer: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urethral-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urethral cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=non-urothelial-bladder-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Non-urothelial bladder cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=small-cell-carcinoma-of-the-bladder\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Small cell carcinoma of the bladder&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS AND STAGING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial approach to diagnosis and evaluation is summarized in the algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F101000\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef101000 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H89698299\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with bladder cancer typically present with gross or microscopic hematuria, although irritative and obstructive voiding symptoms (frequency, urgency, dysuria, nocturia) can be the initial presentation.</p><p>In individuals over the age of 40 years, the presence of otherwise unexplained microscopic or gross hematuria requires evaluation of the bladder and upper urinary tract in order to rule out urinary tract malignancy. A full evaluation of the entire urinary tract is indicated in such patients, unless there is clear evidence of glomerular bleeding or urinary tract infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-bladder-cancer#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging of bladder cancer&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-bladder-cancer#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging of bladder cancer&quot;, section on 'Initial evaluation'</a>.)</p><p>Cystoscopy is the gold standard for the initial diagnosis of bladder cancer. Cystoscopy is combined with urine cytology, which may detect lesions that might be missed at cystoscopy or lesions of the upper urinary tract (ureter, renal pelvis). The initial cystoscopy is typically done in an outpatient setting with a flexible cystoscope. Novel endoscopic imaging techniques, including narrow-band imaging and fluorescence cystoscopy (FC), may help identify more papillary and carcinoma in situ lesions, and use of FC is associated with a modest reduction in recurrence of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer. Patients with visible tumors are either biopsied or resected transurethrally to establish the histopathologic diagnosis and provide an initial assessment of the depth of invasion (mucosa, submucosa, muscularis) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F51333\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51333 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Site-directed biopsies are indicated in patients with high-grade cancers and any suspicious erythematous <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> flat lesions. Biopsy of normal-appearing urothelium and prostatic urethra is indicated in patients with a positive urine cytology and no visually apparent tumor within the bladder.

An increasing body of data indicates that a positive positron emission tomography (PET) scan has a high predictive value for metastatic disease, and increasingly, fused CT-PET imaging is being used in the staging of patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111051\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef111051 \">image 1</a>).

However, this approach must be balanced against the risk of recurrence or progression. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Transurethral resection'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients with low-risk disease are usually managed by TURBT alone plus a single dose of perioperative intravesical chemotherapy given in the operating room or within a few hours of tumor resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-initial-approach-and-management-of-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].

Some patients with low-grade tumors may require two or more resections in order to remove all visible papillary disease. Perioperative single-dose intravesical chemotherapy (usually with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mitomycin</a> C) is indicated in patients with low-grade tumors.</p><p>Patients with high-risk non-muscle invasive bladder cancer should undergo a repeat cystoscopy and may require reresection of areas of high-grade urothelial cancer prior to initiation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intravesical-bacillus-calmette-guerin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">intravesical Bacillus Calmette-Guerin</a> (BCG) therapy. Repeat cystoscopy is important, both to eliminate any visible residual disease and to eliminate the risk of understaging. All of the guidelines are consistent with this as a standard of care for patients with high-grade T1 tumors, and this is an option for patients with high-grade Ta tumors. Biopsies of normal-appearing mucosa adjacent and remote to the tumor should be done to determine whether CIS is present.

This is generally followed by maintenance therapy, and the duration of maintenance therapy is based upon risk stratification.

Urinary diversion is usually performed through an open approach, though some surgeons can perform this using a minimally invasive technique, including laparoscopic or robotic approaches. To date, there are inadequate long-term follow-up data to assess the oncologic equivalence of this technique. A randomized trial of robotic-assisted laparoscopic versus open radical cystectomy did not identify a benefit of reduction in 90-day morbidity for laparoscopic surgery and was closed early [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-initial-approach-and-management-of-urothelial-bladder-cancer/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

This opened the question of whether adjuvant chemotherapy compensated for inadequate surgical treatment. Opponents of the routine use of adjuvant chemotherapy have noted the risk of case selection bias and the lack of central pathology review in the reporting of nonrandomized and observational studies that have recently gained prominence in the medical literature and that have sometimes been reported as a replacement for randomized trial data.
