However, their etiologies and therapy differ, making it important to distinguish them. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A chylothorax occurs when lymph fluid accumulates in the pleural space due to disruption or obstruction of the thoracic duct or its tributaries. Chylothoraces contain a high concentration of triglycerides in the form of chylomicrons, unless the patient has no dietary fat ingestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-chylothorax/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cholesterol effusions (also known as a pseudochylothorax or chyliform effusion) are much less common than chylothoraces and contain a high concentration of cholesterol. These effusions typically occur in patients with thickened and sometimes calcified pleural surfaces in the setting of chronic pleural inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-chylothorax/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-management-of-cholesterol-effusions\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, diagnosis and management of cholesterol effusions&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY OF THE THORACIC DUCT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Generally, the thoracic duct ascends from the cisterna chyli (sac at the lower end of the thoracic duct into which the intestinal and two lumbar lymphatic trunks drain), which lies just anterior to the first or second lumbar vertebra, and passes through the aortic hiatus of the diaphragm to enter the posterior mediastinum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F57280\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57280 \">figure 1</a>), although wide anatomic variation exists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-chylothorax/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. The thoracic duct continues cephalad in a rightward position between the aorta and azygos vein until it reaches the approximate level of the fifth thoracic vertebra, where it crosses over the vertebral column behind the esophagus and continues in the left posterior mediastinum. Commonly, however, below the fifth thoracic vertebra, the thoracic duct is double or plexiform but becomes single above that level. The thoracic duct is 2 to 3 mm in diameter and passes behind the aortic arch adjacent to the left side of the esophagus and behind the left subclavian artery. It then arches over the subclavian artery in the anterolateral superior mediastinum, descending to empty either as a single (50 percent) or multiple [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-chylothorax/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] lymphatic channel into the venous circulation at the angle of junction of the left internal jugular vein with the left subclavian vein. A one-way valve at the union of the thoracic duct and venous circulation prevents blood from entering the thoracic duct; contact with blood causes thrombosis or occlusion of lymphatic channels. &#160;</p><p>In some patients, two thoracic ducts exist through the entirety of the mediastinum, and occasionally a single thoracic duct may empty into right-sided venous structures. In all patients, extensive lymphatic tributaries to the thoracic duct and anastomoses course through the posterior mediastinum adjacent to the heart and major thoracic blood vessels (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F115090\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115090 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>The anatomy of the thoracic duct influences the location of the effusion seen with duct injury or obstruction. Because the thoracic duct usually crosses the mediastinum at the fifth thoracic vertebral body, thoracic duct injury or obstruction below this level generally results in a right&ndash;sided pleural effusion. In contrast, thoracic duct injury or obstruction above this level usually leads to a left-sided effusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-chylothorax/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Of note, only 40 to 60 percent of people have this classic course of the thoracic duct shown in figure 1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-chylothorax/abstract/6,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8</a>]. Disease at any level of the mediastinum that disrupts the multiple lymphatic anastomoses and tributaries to the thoracic duct may produce pleural effusions on either or both sides of the chest.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CHYLE COMPOSITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The thoracic duct carries chyle, which is defined as lymphatic fluid of intestinal origin, to the bloodstream.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chyle has a high content of triglycerides in the form of chylomicrons, which produces the milky, opalescent appearance of lymphatic fluid.

Two large single center studies have retrospectively assessed the etiology of chylothorax [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-chylothorax/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. The largest of these studied 203 patients treated over a 21-year period and found an equal incidence of traumatic (50 percent) and nontraumatic (50 percent) etiologies. Thirteen patients (6 percent) in the nontraumatic group were diagnosed with idiopathic chylothorax after exhaustive evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-chylothorax/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In contrast, the other large but older case series found that 72 percent of chylothoraces were nontraumatic (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F61456\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61456 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-chylothorax/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The etiology of chylothorax likely also varies by the patient population managed in the reporting institution.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Nontraumatic causes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Malignancy is the leading cause of nontraumatic chylothorax. Lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and metastatic cancer have all been noted in association with chylothorax [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-chylothorax/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The lower incidence of chylothorax related to lymphoma in the series reported in 2005 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-chylothorax/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], compared with the older series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-chylothorax/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], probably relates to the earlier diagnosis of lymphoma and prompt initiation of effective therapy, prior to development of chylothorax. Most chylothoraces associated with lymphoma occur in patients with advanced disease. </p><p>Approximately 5 to 10 percent of chylothoraces are idiopathic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-chylothorax/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. However, after extensive patient evaluation or prolonged observation, many idiopathic chylothoraces are eventually linked to an occult neoplasm.</p><p>Less common causes include Castleman's disease (angiocentric or giant lymph node hyperplasia), kaposiform lymphangiomatosis, generalized lymphatic anomaly, sarcoidosis, Kaposi sarcoma, yellow nail syndrome, histoplasmosis, tuberculosis, lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), Noonan syndrome, Down syndrome, Turner syndrome, congenital lymphangiectasia, multiple myeloma, Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, amyloidosis, filariasis, venous thrombosis, thoracic irradiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-chylothorax/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>], superior vena cava syndrome, subclavian vein thrombosis, thoracic duct cysts, constrictive pericarditis, Behcets syndrome, Gorham syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-chylothorax/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], POEMS syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-chylothorax/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], IgG4-related pleuritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-chylothorax/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>], and goiter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-chylothorax/abstract/7,12,19-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,12,19-25</a>]. The mechanism of chylothorax in granulomatous infections such as tuberculosis and histoplasmosis appears to be by a compressive or other effect of mediastinal lymphadenitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-chylothorax/abstract/24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-27</a>].

Retroperitoneal sites of lymphatic leakage can dissect superiorly into the pleural space to cause chylothorax in the absence ascites (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chylous-bloody-and-pancreatic-ascites#H1\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chylous, bloody, and pancreatic ascites&quot;, section on 'Chylous ascites'</a>). Disorders that cause lymphatic masses or malformations (eg, Gorham syndrome, generalized lymphatic anomaly, lymphangiomyomatosis) have varied mechanisms for chylothorax. In some patients, lymphatic masses or malformations may stimulate a large amount of lymphatic fluid that can cause rupture of or seepage from lymphatic ducts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-chylothorax/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Traumatic causes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Disruption of the thoracic duct or its tributaries anywhere along their course can cause a chylothorax [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-chylothorax/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Surgical procedures in the area of the thoracic duct or nearby structures, which account for the majority of cases of traumatic chylothorax, can disrupt the thoracic duct or tear lymphatic tributaries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-chylothorax/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. Esophagectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-chylothorax/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], pulmonary resection with lymph node dissection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-chylothorax/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>], and surgery for congenital heart disease (including heart-lung transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-chylothorax/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]) appear to carry the greatest risk, but thoracic duct injury has been reported in association with almost every thoracic surgical procedure, and may also complicate surgery of the neck or abdomen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-chylothorax/abstract/12,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,35</a>]. Ingestion of milk before surgery has been proposed to increase the visualization of the thoracic duct and to reduce the incidence of postoperative chylothorax [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-chylothorax/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

Patients with nontraumatic chylothoraces frequently experience a gradual onset of decreased exercise tolerance, dyspnea, a heavy feeling in the chest, and fatigue. Fever and chest pain are rare because chyle within the pleural space does not evoke an inflammatory response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-chylothorax/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Chyloptysis (expectorating chylous fluid) due to a pleurobronchial fistula is an exceedingly rare manifestation of chylothorax [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-chylothorax/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. As a variety of medical procedures (eg, central venous catheterization, esophageal embolectomy) and types of surgery are associated with chylothorax, patients should be directly asked about any history of such interventions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F61456\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61456 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>The onset of a posttraumatic chylothorax may be delayed for as long as 10 days after the traumatic event. In surgical patients, the chylothorax may be first detected as a pleural effusion on serial radiographic evaluations or by the persistent drainage of pleural fluid from a preexisting chest tube. A chylothorax occurring in a postpneumonectomy space may be especially difficult to diagnose. Unusually rapid postoperative filling of the pneumonectomy space with fluid, and mediastinal shift to the contralateral side (&quot;tension chylothorax&quot;) are suggestive radiographic findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-chylothorax/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>On physical examination, findings of decreased breath sounds and dullness to percussion may be present depending of the size and location of the effusion.</p><p>Pleural effusion is unilateral in approximately 78 percent and involves the right hemithorax in 67 percent and left hemithorax in 33 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-chylothorax/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H183969546\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION AND DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A chylothorax may come to medical attention when a pleural effusion is noted on a chest radiograph obtained to evaluate dyspnea or for postoperative surveillance, or when milky fluid is noted during thoracentesis or in chest tube drainage. Because a milky or opalescent appearance of the pleural fluid is noted in only approximately half the patients, a high degree of suspicion is needed, particularly in patients who have had chest, neck, or abdominal surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-chylothorax/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Pleural fluid analysis should be performed to look for the characteristic pattern of elevated triglyceride levels or the presence of chylomicrons of the results from triglyceride testing is indeterminate. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Chylothorax versus cholesterol effusion'</a> above.)</p><p>Once a chylothorax has been diagnosed by pleural fluid analysis, imaging techniques are used to identify the site and mechanisms of chyle leakage. The gold standard for localizing the site of lymph leakage has been direct visualization at surgery or lymphangiography. Neither of these approaches are 100 percent sensitive because the leakage may be too slow or diffuse to visualize. Case series indicate that noncontrast magnetic resonance (MR) lymphangiography provides accurate visualization of central thoracic lymphatics and sites of chyle leakage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-chylothorax/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. Similarly, dynamic contrast-enhanced MR lymphangiography with an intranodal injection into inguinal lymph nodes of a gadolinium-based contrast agent has been reported to provide good spatial and temporal resolution for visualizing the anatomy and flow characteristics of the central lymphatic system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/etiology-clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-chylothorax/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. MR lymphangiography offers considerable promise for supplanting standard lymphangiography for imaging the thoracic duct. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6014926\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The routine laboratory testing obtained in patients with a pleural effusion includes a complete blood count and white blood cell differential to screen for underlying diseases, and also serum glucose, total protein, and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) for comparison with pleural fluid values.

Lipoprotein electrophoresis of pleural fluid to detect chylomicrons is the diagnostic criterion for chylothorax, but is not routinely performed as a first test because it is laborious and costly. It is used to establish or exclude the diagnosis when initial test results do not provide a definitive diagnosis.
