The bleeding occurs under the tough, outer covering of the brain, called the &quot;dura&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F65181\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65181 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>An injury to the head causes most subdural hematomas. The most common causes of these injuries include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A car crash</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A fall</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A physical attack</p><p/><p>There are 2 main types of subdural hematomas:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute &ndash; This type happens in the first hours after a head injury. If the bleeding continues, the subdural hematoma can keep growing, days after the injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic &ndash; This type happens most often in older people whose brains have shrunk slightly due to age. In these people, a mild head injury causes bleeding on the brain's surface. The injury can be so mild that the person doesn't even notice it. The hematoma grows slowly, over several days or weeks.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28150287\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of subdural hematoma?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some people pass out after getting a serious head injury and a large, acute subdural hematoma. Other times, the symptoms appear later and can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weakness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Numbness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble walking</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Slurred speech or being unable to speak</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acting less alert than normal</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dizziness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Confusion or trouble thinking</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleepiness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seizures</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28150302\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Tests include imaging tests that take pictures of your brain, such as an MRI or CT scan. These will show the subdural hematoma and how big it is.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28150317\"><span class=\"h1\">How is subdural hematoma treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment depends on the size of the hematoma and your symptoms. You might need surgery to drain the hematoma and relieve the pressure on your brain.</p><p>If you are taking medicines known as &quot;blood-thinners,&quot; such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">aspirin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">warfarin</a> (sample brand names: Coumadin, Jantoven), your doctor might tell you to stop taking these medicines. Be sure to talk to the doctor who first prescribed these medicines about when and if you should take them again.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28150332\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=closed-head-injury-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Closed head injury (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
