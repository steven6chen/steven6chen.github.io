The relative ease of cervical examination allows observation of physiologic changes that occur in response to normal cyclic variations in ovarian hormone secretion, as well as a variety of structural abnormalities and pathologic conditions (premalignant, malignant, infection-related, benign neoplasms). Diagnosis and management require a combination of visual, tactile, and laboratory assessment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EMBRYOLOGY, NORMAL ANATOMY, AND HISTOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Embryology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Fusion of the paired m&uuml;llerian ducts at about day 54 postfertilization results in formation of the uterovaginal canal, which is the precursor of the uterine corpus, cervix, and upper vagina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-cervical-anomalies-and-benign-cervical-lesions/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The caudal end of the uterovaginal canal migrates down to meet the urogenital sinus at a point termed the m&uuml;llerian tubercle, which eventually becomes the vaginal orifice and hymen. At about day 66, stratification of cells in this area give rise to the sinovaginal bulbs, which proliferate to form a solid vaginal plate by day 77. The central cells of the vaginal plate then break down to form the vaginal lumen. Endocervical glands and the vaginal fornices appear between 91 days (13th week) and 15 weeks, thereby providing the first clear signs of the cervix.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Anatomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The normal cervix is fusiform in shape, with the narrowest portions at the internal and external oses. After menarche, the cervix accounts for one-half to one-third of the length of the uterus, and measures 3 to 5 cm in length and 2 to 3 cm in diameter (in prepubertal girls, the cervix is twice the length of the fundus; this ratio reverses with age). The portio vaginalis is the visible portion of the cervix that protrudes into the vagina. The portio vaginalis is surrounded by a reflection of the vaginal wall on each side termed the anterior, posterior, and lateral fornix. The supravaginal cervix is the intraabdominal portion of the cervix that lies above the point of attachment of the vaginal vaults; the peritoneum posterior to the supravaginal cervix forms the lining of the posterior cul-de-sac (pouch of Douglas).</p><p>The cervical canal, which averages 3 cm long and a few millimeters wide, connects the uterine cavity with the vagina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-cervical-anomalies-and-benign-cervical-lesions/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The external cervical os (where the canal opens to the vagina) is small, round, and centrally placed in nulliparous women, but is more likely to be a patulous, transverse slit in women who have labored into the third stage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F72718\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72718 \">figure 1</a>). The internal cervical os (where the canal opens to the uterine cavity) is normally no more than 3 mm in diameter in nonpregnant women, even if parous [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-cervical-anomalies-and-benign-cervical-lesions/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The vagina is at a 90 degree angle to a normal anteverted uterus, thus the external cervical os faces toward the posterior wall of the vagina and the cervix lies between the bladder and rectum.</p><p>The cervix is supported by the uterosacral ligaments, which surround the cervix and vagina and extend laterally and posteriorly toward the second to fourth sacral vertebrae, and the cardinal ligaments, which are fibromuscular bands that fan out laterally from the lower uterine segment and cervix to the lateral pelvic walls. The blood supply comes from a descending branch of the uterine artery and lymphatic drainage is to the parametrial nodes, then to the obturator, internal iliac, and external iliac nodes with secondary drainage to the presacral, common iliac, and paraaortic lymph nodes. The nerve supply is autonomic (sympathetic and parasympathetic). The nerves enter the upper cervix on either side and form two lateral semicircular plexuses, called Frankenh&auml;user plexus, a terminal part of the presacral plexus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Histology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In contrast to the body of the uterus, which is principally a muscular organ, the cervical stroma is predominantly collagen, with some elastic tissue and smooth muscle cells (15 percent).</p><p>The portio vaginalis of the normal cervix is completely covered with smooth, pink, stratified, nonkeratinized squamous epithelium, similar to the lining of the vagina. The squamocolumnar junction is the point at which the squamous epithelium covering the portio joins the columnar epithelium of the cervical canal. The junction can be identified as the line of demarcation between the pale pink squamous epithelium that covers the portio and the bright red columnar epithelium that lines the canal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F105122\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef105122 \">picture 1</a>). The division may be at the external os or inside the endocervical canal. The columnar epithelium often extends well beyond the external os (ectropion, see below), particularly in newborn infants and during puberty and adolescence. In postmenopausal women, the squamocolumnar junction may be high in the canal where it cannot be seen. The union of squamous and columnar epithelium may be abrupt, but more often there is a transformation zone of cuboidal subcolumnar epithelium or reserve cells that have the potential of developing into either columnar or squamous cells. Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia usually originates in the active, constantly changing epithelium that comprises the transformation zone. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-terminology-incidence-pathogenesis-and-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: Terminology, incidence, pathogenesis, and prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The cervical and vaginal epithelium, including the mucus producing columnar epithelium, are responsive to changes in estrogen and progesterone concentrations. Estrogen stimulates production of profuse, watery, alkaline mucus, whereas progesterone causes a thick, scant, acidic mucus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CONGENITAL ABNORMALITIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If one or both m&uuml;llerian ducts fail to fuse, or if development of one or both ducts does not occur, or is incomplete, duplication or agenesis of the cervix can occur. Coexistent anomalies of the vagina, uterus, and urinary tract are common since anomalies of the mesometanephric duct frequently occur in association with those of the m&uuml;llerian ducts. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-management-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-vagina\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and management of congenital anomalies of the vagina&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-uterus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of congenital anomalies of the uterus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-kidney-and-urinary-tract-cakut\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Duplication</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Duplication of the cervix (cervix duplex) may result in two distinct cervices or two fused cervices (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F77029%7EOBGYN%2F75163\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77029 graphicRef75163 \">figure 2A-B</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F76867\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76867 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F62754\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef62754 \">picture 3</a>). It may be difficult to differentiate and determine if there are two separate cervices or if there is a single cervix with a septum. Nonobstructive duplication of the cervix is usually asymptomatic and does not require intervention. Obstructive lesions require surgical intervention (described below) if hematometra or pyometra occurs. In cases of cervical duplication with a longitudinal vaginal septum or an obstructed hemivagina, great care should be taken when removing the septum so as not to compromise the blood supply to the individual cervices.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Agenesis/hypoplasia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cervical agenesis and hypoplasia are rare. With complete agenesis, both the cervix and the upper vagina must be absent, as the proximal portion of the vagina does not form in the absence of a cervix during embryonic development (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F66336%7EOBGYN%2F78045\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66336 graphicRef78045 \">figure 3A-B</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F69790\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69790 \">figure 4</a>). When the cervix is present, but hypoplastic, the vagina can be normal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80051%7EOBGYN%2F67197\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80051 graphicRef67197 \">figure 5A-B</a>).</p><p>Cervical hypoplasia is typically recognized at menarche. Adolescents may present with primary amenorrhea, cyclic or chronic abdominopelvic pain, or a pelvic mass (from hematometra). Imaging with ultrasound and magnetic resonance are helpful in defining the anatomy.</p><p>Historically, the preferred treatment was hysterectomy, given this condition was not considered compatible with future fertility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-cervical-anomalies-and-benign-cervical-lesions/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. However, less aggressive surgical procedures have been developed. One procedure uses molds and both skin and &quot;mucosal&quot; grafts to create an upper vagina and cervical endocervical tract to allow menstruation and potentially enable spontaneous conception and successful pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-cervical-anomalies-and-benign-cervical-lesions/abstract/5-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-10</a>]. The disadvantages of this approach are the risks of recurrent obstruction and ascending infection, which can lead to sepsis and death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-cervical-anomalies-and-benign-cervical-lesions/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p>A treatment algorithm, proposed by one group, is shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F74618\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef74618 \">algorithm 1</a>). Since patients vary widely in their degree of cervical hypoplasia, clinicians should select a surgical procedure carefully and be certain of the diagnosis (eg, differentiate between a high transverse vaginal septum and cervical agenesis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-cervical-anomalies-and-benign-cervical-lesions/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. A safe, successful surgical procedure is more likely when there is normal cervical tissue that just lacks a patent cervical canal than when there is significant cervical agenesis.</p><p>Advances in reproductive endocrinology and fertility therapy have enabled women to avoid the need for surgical intervention. Long-term use of medications that suppress menstruation (eg, combination <span class=\"nowrap\">estrogen/progestin</span> therapy, continuous progestin only, or a GnRH agonist with add-back therapy) can prevent development of hematometra, dysmenorrhea, and chronic pelvic pain. When pregnancy is desired, these medications can be stopped and conception may be attempted using assisted reproductive techniques. Successful pregnancies with planned cesarean delivery have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-cervical-anomalies-and-benign-cervical-lesions/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Diethylstilbestrol induced changes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diethylstilbestrol (DES) is a synthetic nonsteroidal estrogen that was first synthesized in 1938. From about 1940 to 1971, DES was given to pregnant women in the mistaken belief it would reduce the risk of pregnancy complications and losses. In 1971, DES was shown to cause clear cell carcinoma, a rare vaginal tumor in girls and women who had been exposed to this drug in utero [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-cervical-anomalies-and-benign-cervical-lesions/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In addition to its neoplastic potential, DES has also been shown to be teratogenic and associated with cervical hypoplasia, collars, hoods, and polyps. Gross cervical abnormalities can be seen in about 20 percent of exposed women. Cancer is rare (1 case per 1000 to 2000 exposed daughters). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=outcome-and-follow-up-of-diethylstilbestrol-des-exposed-individuals\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Outcome and follow-up of diethylstilbestrol (DES) exposed individuals&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Cervical adenosis also occurs because remnants of the m&uuml;llerian anlage persist beneath the vaginal plate of squamous epithelium, an area where glandular elements are not normally found. Most of the glands are lined by mucin-secreting columnar cells. They may be buried beneath the epithelium, but often glands and their secretions are visible away from the transformation zone on the cervix. Cervical adenosis is typically accompanied by vaginal adenosis.</p><p>DES-related structural cervical abnormalities do not require treatment. There may be an increased risk of cervical insufficiency during pregnancy; such women are closely monitored and may be candidates for placement of a cerclage. These issues are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-insufficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical insufficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">ECTROPION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ectropion occurs when eversion of the endocervix exposes columnar epithelium to the vaginal milieu (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F105122\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef105122 \">picture 1</a>). The everted epithelium has a reddish appearance similar to granulation tissue, and may be covered by a yellow turbid discharge. Ectropion is common in adolescents. After adolescence, it may be observed in women who are pregnant or taking estrogen-progestin contraceptives or who had a cervical laceration during labor and delivery. In parous women, the external os is wide and patulous as a result of changes from prior labor and delivery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F72718\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72718 \">figure 1</a>). In some of these women, opening a vaginal speculum to inspect the cervix causes the anterior and posterior lips to separate, exposing the endocervical canal. As the speculum is withdrawn, the anterior and posterior lips fall together, and often the ectropion disappears.</p><p>Ectropion has also been called erosion, which is a poor term because it implies that the superficial squamous cells have eroded away to expose underlying tissue. Although this can occur, most &quot;erosions&quot; represent areas on the portio of the cervix where squamous cells have been replaced by overgrowth of columnar epithelium.</p><p>Ectropion should not be treated except in the rare occurrence of excessive mucous discharge or spotting that is very bothersome to the woman. In such cases, malignancy should be excluded before undertaking any treatment. An ablative procedure using cryocautery or electrocautery is effective, but is invasive and will result in copious vaginal discharge until healing is completed, which may take weeks. Ablative treatment can also result in cervical stenosis, which can adversely affect future fertility and, if pregnancy is achieved, labor and delivery. As an alternative, we suggest a two-week trial of an acidifying agent, such as boric acid suppositories 600 mg vaginally at bedtime, which may be effective. Use of deoxyribonucleic acid 5 mg vaginal suppositories has also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-cervical-anomalies-and-benign-cervical-lesions/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cervical-intraepithelial-neoplasia-ablative-therapies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cervical intraepithelial neoplasia: Ablative therapies&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">CERVICITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cervicitis is classified as either acute or chronic. The most common symptom, and often the only one, is purulent vaginal discharge. The appearance of the acutely inflamed cervix varies greatly, depending upon the degree of involvement and the infecting organism. Mucopurulent cervical discharge, cervical friability, and cervical edema are characteristics of both gonococcal and chlamydial cervicitis; the latter is more common. Punctate hemorrhages on the vagina and cervix suggest trichomonas infection. Vesicular or ulcerative lesions suggest infection with herpes simplex virus (HSV). The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of cervicitis are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-cervicitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute cervicitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">CYSTIC LESIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cervical cysts are usually asymptomatic, but may cause dyspareunia or a pressure sensation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Nabothian cysts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nabothian cysts (also called mucinous retention cysts, epithelial inclusion cysts) are discrete cystic structures that form when a cleft of columnar epithelium becomes covered with squamous cells and the columnar cells continue to secrete mucoid material. The cysts vary from microscopic to several centimeters in size; the larger ones project above the surface of the portio. They may appear translucent or opaque (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F73788%7EOBGYN%2F53598\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73788 graphicRef53598 \">picture 4A-B</a>). Nabothian cysts may occur following minor trauma or childbirth.</p><p>The only indication for treatment is relief from pain or a bothersome feeling of fullness in the vagina. Ablation of the cyst using electrocautery is the usual approach; however, if the diagnosis is uncertain, excision to evaluate histopathology is advised. The main disadvantage to surgical treatment is the possibility of causing scar tissue, which itself can lead to dyspareunia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Mesonephric cysts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Microscopic remnants of the mesometanephric (Wolffian) duct may be found deep within the cervical stroma when tissue removed at conization is examined pathologically. Occasionally, one or more of these remnants form a cyst, which may be confused with Nabothian cysts. Mesonephric cysts seldom reach a size greater than 2.5 cm, and are usually located at the three and nine o'clock points, near the base of the cervix.</p><p>Intervention should be avoided in asymptomatic women. Treatment similar to that recommended above for Nabothian cysts is indicated if the patient has bothersome symptoms. A large cyst can be marsupialized.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">NONCYSTIC LESIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cervical neoplasms can be asymptomatic, but often present with spotting, especially postcoitally, or discharge. Most are benign, but if a cervical mass lesion is observed, exophytic squamous cell carcinoma should be excluded.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Polyps</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cervical polyps commonly occur during the reproductive years, especially after age 40 years. The etiology is unknown. Chronic inflammation of the cervical canal may play a role, as may hormonal factors, since endometrial hyperplasia and cervical polyps coexist more frequently than one would expect by chance alone. Differential diagnosis includes leiomyoma and endometrial polyps. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometrial-polyps\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometrial polyps&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Single or multiple cervical polyps usually arise from the endocervical canal, but can also originate from the portio (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F53131\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53131 \">picture 5</a>). The tear-shaped or lobular structures appear red, purple, or flesh-colored, depending upon the vascularity and congestion present, and usually look succulent and glistening. The size is typically less than 3 cm in diameter; however, polyps large enough to fill the vagina or presenting at the introitus have been described. The pedicle is usually long and thin, but may be short and broad-based. Histologically, cervical polyps are characterized by vascular connective tissue stroma covered by epithelium, which may be columnar, squamous, or squamocolumnar.</p><p>Polyps should be removed when symptomatic (eg, bleeding, excessive discharge), large (&ge;3 cm), or appearing atypical. Polypectomy can usually be accomplished by grasping the base of the polyp with forceps and twisting it off. If visible, the base can be cauterized to prevent bleeding and reduce the chance of recurrence. If the base is wide, such as is the case with a sessile polyp, the main portion of the polyp should be removed with a biopsy forceps and the base destroyed with cautery or laser to reduce the likelihood of recurrence.</p><p>Malignancy is rarely found in a cervical polyp [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-cervical-anomalies-and-benign-cervical-lesions/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]; however, polyps which are removed should be submitted to the laboratory for histological study.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Warts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vulvar, perineal, and anogenital warts are frequently associated with vaginal and cervical lesions. Single or multiple condylomata acuminata due to HPV infection may be visible grossly, and are asymptomatic. These warts are often flat, in contrast to condyloma in other areas of the anogenital region. They become white, and thus more visible to the naked eye when swabbed with a solution of 3 to 5 percent acetic acid. <span class=\"nowrap\">Cytology/colposcopy</span> may reveal squamous intraepithelial neoplasia. These abnormalities are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=condylomata-acuminata-anogenital-warts-in-adults-epidemiology-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Condylomata acuminata (anogenital warts) in adults: Epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Endometriosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cervical endometriosis, which is rare, appears as red or <span class=\"nowrap\">brownish/blackish</span> areas (&quot;powder burns&quot;) that do not blanch on compression, or as firm nodules on the portio vaginalis. Affected patients may be asymptomatic or may have discharge, dysmenorrhea, or dyspareunia. Clinical manifestations other than discharge are most likely due to implants at other sites in the pelvis, such as the ovary or uterosacral Iigaments. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometriosis: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Histologically these lesions are the same as endometriosis at other sites. Excision or biopsy and pathologic evaluation are the keys to definitive diagnosis. Superficial endometriosis has been confused with endocervical glandular dysplasia and adenocarcinoma, which can only be excluded by biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-cervical-anomalies-and-benign-cervical-lesions/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Differential diagnosis also includes cervical gestational trophoblastic disease and normal hyperemia related to early pregnancy, both of which can be excluded by negative results on human chorionic gonadotropin testing.</p><p>Asymptomatic lesions do not require treatment. If the implants are tender and are causing dyspareunia, electrocautery ablation is therapeutic. Indications for systemic therapy of endometriosis are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endometriosis-treatment-of-pelvic-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endometriosis: Treatment of pelvic pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Adenosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cervical adenosis is a lesion consisting of columnar epithelium surrounded by fibromuscular stroma. Although it usually occurs deep in the cervix, it may arise superficially. Adenosis can be associated with intrauterine diethylstilbestrol (DES) exposure (see below) or be a variant of normal.</p><p>Superficial adenosis appears as cherry red dots. Colposcopically these red dots appear similar to gland openings observed near the transformation zone. The lesions are usually asymptomatic, but can be associated with an increase in clear or white discharge and, rarely, dyspareunia. Electrocautery ablation is only indicated if symptoms are bothersome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Papillomas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Papillomas of the cervix are rare. They arise from the ectocervix near the squamocolumnar junction (transformation zone) and are usually less than 1 cm in diameter. Microscopically, a central core of connecting tissue supports a covering of squamous cells.</p><p>If the papilloma has a long stalk, it can be twisted until it detaches from the cervix. Papillomas can also be excised using biopsy forceps, laser, or loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP); the choice depends on their size and location on the cervix. The base of the papilloma should be cauterized to prevent bleeding and recurrence.</p><p>Papillomas are rarely malignant, nevertheless any tissue that is removed should be submitted for histopathological analysis. Differential diagnosis includes epithelial tags resulting from obstetrical injury, condylomata acuminata, or exophytic squamous cell carcinomas (see individual topic reviews).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Leiomyomas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Leiomyomas are the most common tumors of the uterus, but it is rare to find them isolated to the cervix. Leiomyomas of the cervix can be subserosal, intramural, or submucous and can distort the cervical canal or upper vagina. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uterine-leiomyomas-fibroids-epidemiology-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-natural-history\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uterine leiomyomas (fibroids): Epidemiology, clinical features, diagnosis, and natural history&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Pedunculated leiomyomas are often removed because of their propensity to twist and infarct or bleed. Myomectomy is indicated if there are bothersome symptoms (bladder or bowel dysfunction due to mass displacement, bleeding, dyspareunia), or if the leiomyoma prevents adequate evaluation of the cervix. The removal of large, intramural cervical myomas can be complicated because of proximity to the bladder, bowel, or ureter. Hysterectomy can be considered if childbearing is no longer a concern and the cervical mass is large and symptomatic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Ulcers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Genital ulcers related to sexually transmitted diseases typically occur on external genitalia, but the cervix may be involved. The chancre of syphilis develops at the site of inoculation, which can be the cervix. This ulcer is painless, in contrast to the other two major causes of genital ulcers: herpes simplex virus and Hemophilus ducreyi (chancroid). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chancroid\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chancroid&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-genital-herpes-simplex-virus-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of genital herpes simplex virus infection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-genital-ulcers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with genital ulcers&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=syphilis-epidemiology-pathophysiology-and-clinical-manifestations-in-hiv-uninfected-patients#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Syphilis: Epidemiology, pathophysiology, and clinical manifestations in HIV-uninfected patients&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h1\">CERVICAL STENOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cervical stenosis is usually caused by contraction of scar tissue, agglutination of raw surfaces within the endocervical canal, or obliteration of the endocervical canal by tumor (eg, endometrial or cervical cancer), although some cases are congenital. Cervical surgery and radium application are common causes of scarring; secondary dysmenorrhea or amenorrhea after cervical procedures strongly suggests cervical stenosis has developed. The hypoestrogenic state of menopause induces endocervical changes favorable for agglutination.</p><p>A cervical canal that does not permit the insertion of an instrument, such as a Hegar dilator (2.5 mm in diameter), is considered consistent with cervical canal stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-cervical-anomalies-and-benign-cervical-lesions/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. The diameters of the cervical canal in nulliparous and multiparous women are approximately 5 mm and 8 mm, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-cervical-anomalies-and-benign-cervical-lesions/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>Potential consequences of cervical stenosis include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impeded menstrual flow &mdash; Menses may be scant, painful, or prolonged. In severe stenosis, hematometra can develop. A menstrual blood flow modeling system using a rigid tube suggested that a cervical os greater than 5 mm would allow almost all menstrual blood to flow out through the cervix; however, a diameter less than 2 mm would result in significant retrograde flow out of the fallopian tubes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-cervical-anomalies-and-benign-cervical-lesions/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impeded access to the endocervical canal and endometrial cavity for diagnostic and therapeutic procedures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cervical dystocia during labor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postmenopausal cervical stenosis may completely close the endocervix so that secretions and cellular debris from the atrophic endometrial cavity cannot escape and accumulate in the body of the uterus (hematometra, hydrometra). Infection of the accumulated debris leads to pyometra.</p><p/><p>Treatment of cervical stenosis consists of dilatation of the cervix to allow access to and drainage from the uterine cavity. This can sometimes be performed as an office procedure. A paracervical block is given and an examination to determine the axis of the uterus is performed. The cervix is then grasped with a tenaculum and dilated with the smallest cervical dilator available; however, in many cases, even the smallest such dilator is still too large. For a very stenotic os, a small silver wire probe or lacrimal duct probe is usually the best instrument with which to begin. Brute force should be avoided because there is a high risk of creating a false passage or perforating the cervix or uterus. If office dilatation is unsuccessful, the procedure can be attempted in the operating room under general or regional anesthesia and with use of a hysteroscope. Ultrasound guidance is also very helpful to guide the probe or dilator into the uterine cavity and avoid cervical or uterine perforation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uterine-perforation-during-gynecologic-procedures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uterine perforation during gynecologic procedures&quot;</a>.)</p><p>When a hematometra is present, entry into the uterus will be signaled by passage of thick, brown blood and mucus. An endocervical curettage should be done to exclude a cervical or endometrial tumor as soon as the curette can be introduced. Pyometra should be cultured and broad spectrum antibiotics administered. After the contents of the uterus are drained, the cervical canal is dilated to the largest diameter possible using standard dilators, unless future childbearing is planned.</p><p>The cervix can be &quot;kept open&quot; in a number of ways. One method is to place a silicone Malecot catheter (16 to 22 french) or a pediatric Foley catheter after the cervix has been mechanically dilated. The catheter should be sewn in place with a permanent suture through the catheter and through the cervical tissue to decrease the risk that it will be expelled. The catheter is left in situ until the tract has healed (average of 10 to 14 days); the patient receives prophylactic antibiotics (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> 100 mg orally twice per day) until it is removed to decrease the risk of an ascending infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-cervical-anomalies-and-benign-cervical-lesions/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Alternatively, a 3 or 4 mm dilator can be passed through the endocervical canal once per week until the point of stricture remains open without force. This usually requires three or four weekly dilatations carried out in the office following administration of a paracervical block. A nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agent (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a> 600 to 800 mg orally) should be taken one hour prior to the procedure to diminish patient discomfort. An alternative procedure using a carbon dioxide laser to vaporize scar tissue and enlarge the cervical os was successful in small series of patients with iatrogenic cervical stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-cervical-anomalies-and-benign-cervical-lesions/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. Hysteroscopic resection using a wire loop followed by placement of 12-French pediatric catheter for two weeks has also been successful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/congenital-cervical-anomalies-and-benign-cervical-lesions/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p>If symptomatic cervical stenosis in a premenopausal woman who wants to maintain childbearing capacity cannot be resolved using these techniques, hormonally suppressive therapy can be given (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Agenesis/hypoplasia'</a> above).</p><p>In rare instances where patency cannot be maintained and future fertility is not a desire, hysterectomy is indicated, particularly if there is recurrent infection or pain. Endometrial sampling is essential to exclude uterine cancer before hysterectomy is undertaken.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h1\">PREMALIGNANT AND MALIGNANT LESIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Premalignant cervical lesions and cervical carcinoma are discussed in detail separately.

Obstructive lesions require surgical intervention if hematometra or pyometra occurs. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Duplication'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ectropion occurs when eversion of the endocervix exposes columnar epithelium to the vaginal milieu (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F105122\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef105122 \">picture 1</a>). Treatment is unnecessary except in the rare occurrence of excessive mucous discharge or spotting that is very bothersome to the woman. We suggest a trial of an acidifying agent, such as boric acid suppositories 600 mg vaginally at bedtime (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). An ablative procedure using cryocautery or electrocautery is effective, but is invasive and will result in copious vaginal discharge until healing is completed. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Ectropion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nabothian and mesonephric cysts occur on the portio vaginalis, and have a similar appearance. If these lesions are associated with bothersome symptoms (discharge, pressure, dyspareunia), we suggest ablation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Cystic lesions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cervical polyps are common and usually originate from the endocervical canal. We suggest removal of symptomatic (spotting) or large polyps (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). This can usually be accomplished by grasping them at the base with forceps and twisting. If the base is wide, the main portion of the polyp is removed with a biopsy forceps and the base destroyed with electrocautery or laser. Differential diagnosis includes leiomyoma and endometrial polyps. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Polyps'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If a cervical mass lesion is observed, exophytic squamous cell carcinoma should be excluded. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Noncystic lesions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cervical stenosis is caused by scar tissue, agglutination of raw surfaces within the endocervical canal, or obliteration of the endocervical canal by tumor; some cases are congenital. Dilation of the stenotic cervix can be performed starting with a wire, lacrimal duct probe, or standard mechanical dilators, as appropriate. We suggest placing a Malecot catheter (16 to 22 french) to keep the cervix open after it has been mechanically dilated (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The catheter is left in situ until the tract has healed (average of 10 days); the patient receives prophylactic antibiotics (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a> 100 mg orally twice per day) until it is removed to decrease the risk of an ascending infection.
