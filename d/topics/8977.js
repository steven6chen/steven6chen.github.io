Effective interventions include a number of nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic therapies that are often provided in combination. Patients with fibromyalgia generally respond best to a multidisciplinary, individualized treatment program that incorporates both clinician and non-clinician providers, including physical medicine, rehabilitation, and mental health specialists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The initial steps in the treatment of fibromyalgia in adults will be reviewed here. The treatment of fibromyalgia in adults who do not respond to initial therapies; the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and differential diagnosis of fibromyalgia; and fibromyalgia in children and adolescents are discussed separately.

Most specialty groups recommend that the initial management of patients with fibromyalgia can and should be carried out in the primary care setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Ideally, treatment should include an integrated, multidisciplinary nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic approach, but there have been relatively few trials that have formally evaluated such a combined approach to therapy.

Some patients respond sufficiently well without drug therapy to avoid the need for medications; this is more common among those presenting in the primary care setting. (See <a href=\"#H27\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p>The benefits of nonpharmacologic interventions are supported by a number of systematic reviews and meta-analyses, which have found that cardiovascular exercise, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), other psychological therapies, patient education, and multidisciplinary interventions may provide benefit in patients with fibromyalgia, particularly short-term improvements in pain and health-related quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/1-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H352170621\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENT EDUCATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with fibromyalgia need to understand their illness before any medications are prescribed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. It is important to educate the patient regarding the diagnosis and treatment of fibromyalgia, the uncertainty regarding pathogenesis, and the patient&rsquo;s role in their own treatment. This approach is supported by systematic reviews of observational studies and randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. When possible, such education should also include family members (see <a href=\"#H2413575051\" class=\"local\">'Key elements of patient education'</a> below and <a href=\"#H352170655\" class=\"local\">'Effectiveness of patient education'</a> below and <a href=\"#H352172356\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy of exercise'</a> below and <a href=\"#H9485848\" class=\"local\">'Information for patients'</a> below).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2413575051\"><span class=\"h2\">Key elements of patient education</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patient education should be individualized with respect to the priority given to each of its different aspects; it should include the following elements: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reassurance that fibromyalgia is a real illness &ndash; The patient must be reassured that fibromyalgia is a real illness and is not imagined or &ldquo;in your head.&rdquo; The benign nature of the disorder should also be emphasized. As an example, patients must be told that this is not a deforming or deteriorating condition and that it is neither a life-threatening nor a cosmetic problem. The relationship of neurohormones to pain perception, fatigue, abnormal sleep, and mood disturbances should be discussed; this will help the patient to understand the rationale of therapy with medications such as tricyclic and other antidepressants and antiseizure medications.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lack of evidence of persistent infection &ndash; Patients should be assured that there is no evidence that these syndromes are related to persistent infection, although infections may be important precipitating factors. Diagnostic criteria for the classification of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), also known as systemic exertion intolerance disease (SEID), are similar to those for fibromyalgia, and the majority of patients with <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> meet tender point criteria for fibromyalgia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Similarly, approximately 70 percent of patients with fibromyalgia meet the criteria for <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Some patients with fibromyalgia, particularly those who also meet the criteria for <span class=\"nowrap\">CFS/SEID,</span> may believe that their illness is caused by an undiagnosed infection. In our experience, patients generally have a better response to treatment when they understand that they are not harboring some infectious agent over which they have no control. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-fatigue-syndrome-systemic-exertion-intolerance-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of chronic fatigue syndrome (systemic exertion intolerance disease)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Role of stress and mood disorders &ndash; A review of the role of stress and mood disturbances in fibromyalgia will encourage the patient to learn simple relaxation techniques and to consider formal stress-reduction programs. Physical or emotional stress may precipitate or aggravate fibromyalgia. Additionally, approximately 30 percent of patients with fibromyalgia have major depression at the time of diagnosis. The lifetime prevalence of depression is 74 percent, and that of an anxiety disorder is 60 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Patients with mood disorders should be strongly encouraged to obtain treatment for these conditions, which may be provided by primary care clinicians or by experts in psychiatric care.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Role of sleep disorders and sleep hygiene &ndash; Patients should be educated regarding good sleep hygiene and the potential benefit of correcting poor sleep habits and of recognizing and obtaining treatment for sleep disorders that may contribute to pain and other symptoms of fibromyalgia. Relatively common sleep disorders that may require intervention include obstructive sleep apnea and restless legs syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of fibromyalgia in adults&quot;, section on 'Coexisting disorders'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of restless legs syndrome and periodic limb movement disorder in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Role of exercise &ndash; We counsel patients regarding the importance of exercise for reconditioning and for functional capacity, and caution that a temporary increase in myalgias may occur upon initiating an exercise program. It has been suggested that blood flow to muscle and skin may be sluggish in fibromyalgia. In our experience, a discussion of the role of muscle &ldquo;spasm&rdquo; and deficient muscle blood flow is useful when prescribing exercise and physical therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prognosis &ndash; Patients need to appreciate that their symptoms will wax and wane but that the pain and fatigue generally persist. Despite the presence of these chronic symptoms, it is reassuring to emphasize that the great majority of patients live normal and active lives.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Education about maladaptive chronic illness behavior should be provided, either by the primary care provider or in conjunction with a more formal cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) program. CBT can be done individually or in group sessions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults-not-responsive-to-initial-therapies#H22299539\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of fibromyalgia in adults not responsive to initial therapies&quot;, section on 'Psychological therapies'</a>.)</p><p/><p>These educational elements must be tailored to the individual. For example, patients who tend to catastrophize may require more formal cognitive behavior restructuring, whereas those who have been resistant to exercise will require more information about the importance of activity and exercise programs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H352170655\"><span class=\"h2\">Effectiveness of patient education</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patient education, including making or confirming the diagnosis, and education regarding the nature of the disorder and the rationale for the treatment approach have a beneficial effect. Most patients have had fibromyalgia for years before the diagnosis is finally made. They often have undergone multiple diagnostic evaluations and have consulted with many different specialists. Some patients may feel rejected by the medical profession, while others may fear that a life-threatening illness will eventually be found.</p><p>Evidence of benefit for patients and society from making the diagnosis includes: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study from the United Kingdom, which found that there were fewer referrals and less diagnostic testing after a fibromyalgia diagnosis was made [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another study in which, following a diagnosis of fibromyalgia, patients underwent less diagnostic testing and imaging and in which there were fewer specialty referrals, fewer primary care visits, and fewer drug prescriptions than prior to the diagnosis being made [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]</p><p/><p>Evidence of benefit from education is illustrated by the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The benefits of educational interventions are supported by a 2004 systematic review of treatment of fibromyalgia that assessed the effectiveness of educational interventions in patients receiving those interventions, compared with controls either waiting for care or receiving training in gentle stretching exercises [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The studies reviewed were typically unblinded. Small group sessions, printed materials, lectures, and demonstrations were used to inform patients of the nature of fibromyalgia. Numbers of sessions ranged from 6 to 17. Those receiving the educational intervention had significantly more improvement than the controls in one or more of several outcomes used, including pain, sleep, fatigue, self-efficacy, quality of life, and the six-minute walk, and beneficial effects lasted from 3 to 12 months after the sessions ended.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A single intensive educational intervention may also be beneficial, as was the case in a study in which patients received education from a multidisciplinary team over 1.5 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. One month later, there was significantly less pain, as well as more improvement in self-reported function, fatigue, stiffness, anxiety, and depressed mood, in those who received the educational intervention.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trials demonstrating the benefit of multidisciplinary nonpharmacologic treatment programs have frequently included a significant patient education component [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Additionally, education focusing on self-management, combined with exercise, enhances the benefits of exercise in fibromyalgia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H352172117\" class=\"local\">'Exercise'</a> below and <a href=\"#H352172356\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy of exercise'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H352172117\"><span class=\"h1\">EXERCISE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Exercise can be of significant benefit for pain and function, and may be of benefit for sleep; we recommend cardiovascular fitness training for patients with fibromyalgia based upon the data from individual randomized trials and systematic reviews [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>]. In practice, it has been difficult to start and maintain fibromyalgia patients in a structured cardiovascular exercise program, because patients generally perceive that their pain and fatigue worsen as they begin to exercise. Thus, it is important to instruct patients in the principles and methods of gradual incremental cardiovascular fitness programs. Even modest increases in daily physical activity may benefit patient-assessed physical function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Low-impact aerobic activities such as fast walking, biking, swimming, or water aerobics are most successful among the interventions that have been studied and in our experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/4-7,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7,17</a>]. The type and intensity of the program should be individualized and should be based upon patient preference and the presence of any other cardiovascular, pulmonary, or musculoskeletal comorbidities. Physical therapists or exercise physiologists familiar with fibromyalgia can provide helpful instruction.</p><p>Optimal cardiovascular fitness training generally requires a minimum of 30 minutes of aerobic exercise three times per week in a range near target heart rate. However, even with gradual increases in exercise, some patients may not achieve this goal, and patients should be encouraged to continue exercising regularly. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-benefits-and-risks-of-exercise#H32\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The benefits and risks of exercise&quot;, section on 'Exercise prescription'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-and-fitness-in-the-prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exercise and fitness in the prevention of cardiovascular disease&quot;, section on 'The exercise prescription'</a>.)</p><p>Additional forms of exercise that have shown some benefit in fibromyalgia but which are not primarily directed at developing aerobic fitness include &ldquo;mind-body&rdquo; interventions such as tai chi and yoga. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults-not-responsive-to-initial-therapies#H22300591\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of fibromyalgia in adults not responsive to initial therapies&quot;, section on 'Tai chi'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults-not-responsive-to-initial-therapies#H22300598\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of fibromyalgia in adults not responsive to initial therapies&quot;, section on 'Yoga'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H352172356\"><span class=\"h2\">Efficacy of exercise</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A 2008 systematic review of randomized trials of aerobic exercise for fibromyalgia, involving 2276 subjects across 34 studies, found beneficial effects on aerobic performance, pain, and pressure thresholds over tender points in those subjects who received aerobic exercise training [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Improvement was seen in pain, global wellbeing, and physical function.</p><p>Strength training and flexibility exercises have not been extensively studied; however, there is some evidence of benefit from strength training in some small trials that used several different types of resistance training programs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Some reports have found that the benefits of a muscle strength training program, including reduced pain severity, are comparable to those of an aerobic exercise program [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. A systematic review found that water exercises have been effective in fibromyalgia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>A Canadian panel that reviewed the evidence for exercise in 2008 created a practice guideline that makes similar recommendations to ours for aerobic fitness exercises and strength training in the management of fibromyalgia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. This approach is also supported by the findings of a three-year trial examining the benefits of a six-month exercise training program in women with fibromyalgia, which resulted in improvements in a number of key health domains that were maintained over 30 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">MEDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most patients, we recommend the use of medications for the treatment of the symptoms associated with fibromyalgia together with continued nonpharmacologic measures. However, some patients respond adequately to nonpharmacologic measures alone; such responses are more common among patients presenting initially to primary care clinicians, compared with those initially seen by specialists or referred to specialty treatment centers. (See <a href=\"#H352170621\" class=\"local\">'Patient education'</a> above and <a href=\"#H352172117\" class=\"local\">'Exercise'</a> above.)</p><p>The medications that are the best studied and that have been most consistently effective in the treatment of fibromyalgia are certain antidepressants and selected anticonvulsants. The antidepressants include widely available tricyclic medications, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amitriptyline</a>, and several selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI), including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=duloxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">duloxetine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=milnacipran-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">milnacipran</a>. Another related tricyclic medication, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclobenzaprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclobenzaprine</a>, is also effective in patients with fibromyalgia, but it is not used to treat depression. The anticonvulsants that are beneficial include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregabalin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pregabalin</a>.</p><p>Studies to define the mechanisms of action for these central nervous system acting drugs in fibromyalgia are ongoing.

In patients with an inadequate response or with intolerance of a tricyclic, we use a SNRI (one of the dual reuptake inhibitors) or one of the anticonvulsants. An alternative initial therapy in patients with more severe fatigue or depression or with more severe sleep disturbance is a SNRI or an anticonvulsant, respectively. In general, drugs should be started at low doses and should be built up slowly.

A response was defined as at least a 30 percent decrease in the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) score. A significantly greater proportion of patients receiving gabapentin were responders than were those in the placebo group (51 versus 31 percent, respectively), and the difference in the mean BPI scores between the two groups also favored gabapentin treatment. Gabapentin was generally well-tolerated, although dizziness, sedation, lightheadedness, and weight gain were reported significantly more often by those in the gabapentin group.

There are several approaches we advise in such patients, depending upon patient preference and upon available resources and expertise. These interventions are discussed in detail separately.

One study of 538 patients followed at six referral centers found that pain, fatigue, sleep disturbances, anxiety, and depression were essentially unchanged over a follow-up period of approximately eight years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. Similarly, in the author&rsquo;s experience at a referral rheumatology center, there has been little change in the patients&rsquo; symptoms. However, two-thirds of patients reported that they were working full-time and that fibromyalgia interfered only modestly with their lives.</p><p>In an observational study involving 1555 patients with fibromyalgia followed for up to 11 years by American rheumatologists, there was little clinically meaningful change in mean symptom severity, with patients reporting generally continuing high levels of symptoms and distress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. There was a slight trend toward improvement, with approximately 25 percent of patients experiencing at least moderate improvement of pain over time.</p><p>In contrast with the patient population studied from tertiary referral centers, patients treated by primary care clinicians in the community have a much better prognosis. In one community survey of 141 fibromyalgia subjects, only 35 percent of those with chronic widespread pain at the initial assessment still had widespread pain two years later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].</p><p>Approximately 10 to 30 percent of patients with fibromyalgia report that they are work disabled, a higher incidence than some other groups with chronic pain. In a Canadian study, for example, the incidence of disability was evaluated in 100 patients with fibromyalgia, 76 patients with widespread musculoskeletal pain, and 135 control individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. The proportions reporting being work disabled were 31, 11, and 2 percent, respectively. Fibromyalgia patients were also much more likely to be receiving a disability pension (26, 9, and 3 percent, respectively).</p><p>In a subsequent North American study of persons with fibromyalgia under 65 years of age, almost 10-fold more individuals reported that they were unable to work because of health compared with those without fibromyalgia (55.8 versus 5.8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. Consistent with this observation, persons with fibromyalgia below 65 years filed Social Security disability applications at any time much more often than individuals without fibromyalgia (50.5 versus 5.8 percent). Additionally, disability payments were made more frequently in the last year to those with fibromyalgia compared with those without the condition (30.2 versus 2.8 percent).</p><p>Demographic and psychosocial factors substantially impact the prognosis and outcome in fibromyalgia. Female gender, low socioeconomic status, and being unemployed have had adverse effects on outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/76,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">76,77</a>]. Obesity has also been associated with increased symptoms in women with fibromyalgia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. However, depression, a history of abuse, catastrophizing, and excess somatic concern have been the most important factors in adverse outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/79-81\" class=\"abstract_t\">79-81</a>].</p><p>Overall mortality rates do not appear to be increased in patients with fibromyalgia, but an increased risk of suicide may be present among such patients, as shown in other studies of non-cancer related chronic pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/82-84\" class=\"abstract_t\">82-84</a>]. In a study of 1361 Danish patients with fibromyalgia referred over a 16-year period, using the Danish Mortality Register, the standardized mortality ratios (SMR) for an increased risk of death from suicide was significantly increased (SMR 10.5, 95% CI 4.5-20.7) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h1\">GUIDELINES OF PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Our approach is generally consistent with the recommendations of various expert panels and with the guidelines from professional organizations that have been proposed for treatment of adults with fibromyalgia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/2,3,85,86\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3,85,86</a>]. Most of these guidelines preceded the regulatory approval of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregabalin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pregabalin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=duloxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">duloxetine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=milnacipran-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">milnacipran</a> for fibromyalgia treatment.</p><p>As an example of such guidelines, a Canadian task force recommended that fibromyalgia care be initiated in the primary care setting, incorporating nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic strategies in a multimodal approach with active patient participation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The proposed treatment objectives were reduction of symptoms, as well as improved function using a patient-tailored treatment approach that is symptom-based. Self-management strategies combining good lifestyle habits and fostering a strong locus of control were considered imperative.

Treatment should be individualized and multidisciplinary, involving both nonpharmacologic measures and, in most patients, drug therapy. Some patients, particularly among those presenting initially to primary care clinicians, may respond adequately to nonpharmacologic measures alone. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7185818\" class=\"local\">'Overview of treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should be educated regarding the diagnosis and treatment of fibromyalgia, the uncertainty regarding pathogenesis, and the patient&rsquo;s role in their own treatment.

Low-impact aerobic activities such as fast walking, biking, swimming, or water aerobics are most successful. The type and intensity of the program should be individualized and should be based upon patient preference and the presence of any other comorbidities. (See <a href=\"#H352172117\" class=\"local\">'Exercise'</a> above and <a href=\"#H352172356\" class=\"local\">'Efficacy of exercise'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients who do not have mild disease that responds to educational measures and exercise alone, we recommend the addition of medications (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amitriptyline</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=duloxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">duloxetine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=milnacipran-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">milnacipran</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pregabalin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pregabalin</a>) as the next step for the treatment of the symptoms associated with fibromyalgia, rather than nonpharmacologic measures alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). In general, drugs should be started at low doses and should be built up slowly. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Medications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest initiating therapy with a low dose of a tricyclic medication at nighttime (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amitriptyline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amitriptyline</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). The initial amitriptyline dose is usually 10 mg one to three hours before bedtime, increased by 5 mg at two-week intervals to the minimal dose required (eg, 25 to 50 mg). The dose may be limited by adverse side effects, especially in older adults. In patients with mild to moderate symptoms, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclobenzaprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclobenzaprine</a> is an alternative to amitriptyline.

(See <a href=\"#H7185818\" class=\"local\">'Overview of treatment'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-fibromyalgia-in-adults-not-responsive-to-initial-therapies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of fibromyalgia in adults not responsive to initial therapies&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prognosis of fibromyalgia varies. Patients treated by primary care clinicians in the community have a better prognosis than the population of patients seen in tertiary referral centers.

A better prognosis is associated with certain psychological factors and behaviors.
