This review will cover specific anatomical and physiologic differences between children and adults that affect medical care. The approach to the injured child is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trauma-management-approach-to-the-unstable-child\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trauma management: Approach to the unstable child&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-initially-stable-child-with-blunt-or-penetrating-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the initially stable child with blunt or penetrating injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PEDIATRIC ANATOMY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Airway</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several features of the airway in infants and children can make airway management challenging in patients with major trauma:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Small oral cavities and relatively large tongues and tonsils predispose to airway obstruction, especially in semiconscious or comatose patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-airway-management-in-children-unique-pediatric-considerations#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency airway management in children: Unique pediatric considerations&quot;, section on 'Anatomic considerations'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The relatively large occiput in the infant or child naturally flexes the neck in the supine position, causing airway obstruction as well as potentially exacerbating any unstable cervical spine injury. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pediatric-cervical-spinal-motion-restriction#H689799690\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pediatric cervical spinal motion restriction&quot;, section on 'Neutral spine position'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The larynx is more cephalad and anterior in the neck, making adequate visualization during endotracheal intubation more difficult. Other factors to consider include the short trachea and the U-shaped, floppy epiglottis in infants and young children. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-airway-management-in-children-unique-pediatric-considerations#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency airway management in children: Unique pediatric considerations&quot;, section on 'Anatomic considerations'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A narrow tracheal diameter, a small distance between the tracheal rings, and a cricothyroid membrane that is not easily palpable combine to make needle cricothyroidotomy (to provide percutaneous transtracheal ventilation) a technically challenging option in infants and children. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-difficult-pediatric-airway\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The difficult pediatric airway&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=needle-cricothyroidotomy-with-percutaneous-transtracheal-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Needle cricothyroidotomy with percutaneous transtracheal ventilation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With the short trachea (5 cm long in infants, 7 cm long in 18-month-old children), there is a higher risk for initial right mainstem bronchus intubation or subsequent accidental tube dislodgement with any motion of the head. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emergency-airway-management-in-children-unique-pediatric-considerations#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emergency airway management in children: Unique pediatric considerations&quot;, section on 'Anatomic considerations'</a>.)</p><p/><p>Taken together, these factors make securing and maintaining the airway of pediatric trauma patients more difficult than in adults, especially in children &lt;3 years of age.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Head</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infants and young children &lt;8 years of age have heads that are disproportionately large relative to the rest of their body. As a result, head trauma is commonly present following blunt injury and is the leading cause of mortality in pediatric trauma. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=severe-traumatic-brain-injury-in-children-initial-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Severe traumatic brain injury in children: Initial evaluation and management&quot;</a>.) </p><p>In addition, burns to the face and scalp in children potentially involve a larger proportion of body surface area (up to 19 percent in young infants) as compared to those in adults (up to 9 percent) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F67481\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67481 \">table 1</a>).

As a result, they tend to tolerate an expanding intracranial hematoma better than older children or adults.</p><p>However, the infant brain is less myelinated and the cranium thinner and less protective; therefore, mild forces may still result in skull fractures <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> significant parenchymal injury. In addition, the possibility of abusive head injury in infants and young children must be considered and may present with abrupt altered mental status and severe traumatic head injury (TBI) on head CT without a plausible mechanism. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minor-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Minor head trauma in infants and children: Evaluation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=child-abuse-epidemiology-mechanisms-and-types-of-abusive-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Child abuse: Epidemiology, mechanisms, and types of abusive head trauma in infants and children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Spinal cord/spine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Young children are at increased risk for spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality (SCIWORA; spinal cord injury without plain radiographic or computed tomographic abnormality) because of anatomic flexibility that allows the cervical spine to stretch farther without injury than the spinal cord can tolerate. Many of these children will demonstrate abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging. Despite this anatomic characteristic, SCIWORA occurs rarely in children. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spinal-cord-injury-without-radiographic-abnormality-sciwora-in-children#H26108408\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality (SCIWORA) in children&quot;, section on 'Terminology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spinal-cord-injury-without-radiographic-abnormality-sciwora-in-children#H26107899\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spinal cord injury without radiographic abnormality (SCIWORA) in children&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Chest</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children have a compliant chest wall, so rib fractures are less common, and pulmonary injury (eg, pulmonary contusion) is often present without bony disruption. In addition, because of their mobile mediastinal structures, children are more likely to develop tension pneumothoraces than adults. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-stabilization-of-children-with-thoracic-trauma#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and stabilization of children with thoracic trauma&quot;, section on 'Anatomy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Abdomen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The liver and spleen in infants and toddlers are less protected by the rib cage and are more prone to direct injury.

Hypothermia can complicate an already critical situation as it may worsen metabolic acidosis and exert a negative inotropic effect on the heart. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypothermia-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypothermia in children: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Pediatric considerations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Breathing and ventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypoxia is the most common cause of cardiac arrest in children. Adequate oxygenation is essential, as is adequate ventilation to maintain acid-base balance. Because of limited functional residual capacity and increased oxygen utilization relative to adults, infants and children become hypoxemic much more quickly when ventilation is inadequate. Infants and young children also have smaller tidal volumes (6 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg),</span> and are at greater risk for iatrogenic barotrauma with overly aggressive artificial ventilation.
