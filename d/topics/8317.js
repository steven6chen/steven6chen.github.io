In contrast to women on cyclic regimens, women using continuous-dose regimens benefit from reduction of menstrual symptoms (eg, headache, genital irritation, tiredness, bloating, and pain) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormonal-contraception-for-suppression-of-menstruation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. We educate our patients that unscheduled bleeding is common on extended regimens.</p><p>Menstruation (ovulation followed by withdrawal bleeding) is not physiologically necessary for women not wishing to conceive. In fact, most modern women experience many more menstrual cycles in their lifetime than women in prior generations because of earlier menarche, fewer pregnancies, reduced duration of breastfeeding, and later menopause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormonal-contraception-for-suppression-of-menstruation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Moreover, this frequent, regular ovulation may actually increase a woman's risk of some diseases, such as endometriosis and ovarian cancer.</p><p>The concept that monthly bleeding is healthy has been perpetuated by oral contraceptives (OC) that were initially designed to mimic the average length of a normal menstrual cycle.

In contrast to surgical procedures, such as endometrial ablation and hysterectomy, medical therapy does not irreversibly impair fertility.

For example, a woman who needs or chooses to avoid estrogen-containing therapies can choose from injections every 12 weeks or an IUD with three or five-year duration. Discussion of the risks and benefits of each method will help her select the best option.

Further suppression of menses is achieved by using an extended or continuous regimen rather than a cyclic regimen. Extended and continuous regimens are safe and have few side effects (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F69223\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69223 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormonal-contraception-for-suppression-of-menstruation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Cyclic contraceptive pills</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cyclic use of estrogen-progestin contraceptive pills (OCs) represents a reasonable first-line therapy if the goal is reduction, but not necessarily elimination, of monthly blood flow and there are no contraindications to estrogen administration (eg, previous thromboembolic event or stroke, history of an estrogen-dependent tumor, &ge;35 years of age and a cigarette smoker or obese, active liver disease, undiagnosed abnormal uterine bleeding). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-use-of-estrogen-progestin-contraceptives\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the use of estrogen-progestin contraceptives&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Shortening the hormone-free interval from seven to fewer days or use of low-dose estrogen during the traditional hormone-free week provides greater ovarian suppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormonal-contraception-for-suppression-of-menstruation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], which may help reduce the occurrence of symptoms associated with hormone withdrawal and the risk of pregnancy. Withdrawal <span class=\"nowrap\">spotting/bleeding</span> may occur during pill-free intervals. Several monthly OC formulations which include a shortened hormone-free interval (these can be referred to as <span class=\"nowrap\">24/4</span> OC formulations) are currently marketed in the United States (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F69223\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69223 \">table 3</a>).</p><p>Women who suffer from menstrual symptoms may obtain only limited relief when they use standard 28-day cyclic OCs (21 to 24 days of hormonally active medication). Many will still experience menstrual symptoms during the hormone-free interval and regular withdrawal bleeding still occurs, although the amount of blood loss is significantly reduced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormonal-contraception-for-suppression-of-menstruation/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. These women may benefit from an extended dose regimen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Extended and continuous use of contraceptive pills</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women using extended-use regimens take active hormone pills continuously for 28 days or more followed by periodic hormone-free intervals. The duration of active pill use is determined by the individual woman's preferences; she can choose when and how often hormone-free intervals occur. Extended use regimens decrease the number and frequency of withdrawal bleeds. In contrast, continuous-dose regimens consist only of active hormone pills and eliminate the hormone-free intervals. Therefore the woman has no <span class=\"nowrap\">scheduled/withdrawal</span> bleeding. There are several strategies to help women use oral contraceptive pills in an extended or continuous dose fashion.</p><p>One strategy to implement an extended-use approach uses a conventional <span class=\"nowrap\">21/7</span> monophasic OC formulation (such formulations are often generic and may cost less). The patient is instructed to take one active tablet for 42 consecutive days or 63 consecutive days followed by four pill-free days. During the pill-free days, the woman typically will have withdrawal bleeding. This regimen can be repeated as long as the woman wants to continue taking OCs. To convert this strategy to a continuous regimen, the woman takes one active pill every day and the pill-free days are omitted completely. The woman will have no scheduled menstrual bleeding. Continuous-dose regimens may be indicated for medical issues or patient preference for no withdrawal bleeding.</p><p><br/>Another option is to use a product specifically packaged for extended-dose use (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F69223\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69223 \">table 3</a>). Seasonale was designed to decrease menstrual bleeding to four times per year. Each OC pack contains 84 active tablets of ethinyl estradiol 30 mcg and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levonorgestrel-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levonorgestrel</a> 150 mcg followed by seven placebo pills. This formulation (now also available as a generic) appears to provide both high contraceptive efficacy (failure rate 0.60 pregnancies per 100 women per year in a clinical trial) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormonal-contraception-for-suppression-of-menstruation/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>] and endometrial safety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormonal-contraception-for-suppression-of-menstruation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Seasonique (also available as a generic) is similar to Seasonale, but has seven days of 10 mcg ethinyl estradiol instead of placebo pills. In a report comparing the findings of two similarly designed clinical trials, use of Seasonique resulted in less unscheduled bleeding than Seasonale [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormonal-contraception-for-suppression-of-menstruation/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Seasonique also has better follicular suppression, and thus possibly better contraceptive efficacy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormonal-contraception-for-suppression-of-menstruation/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. LoSeasonique (available as a generic) is similar to Seasonique, but has 84 tablets containing ethinyl estradiol 20 mcg and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levonorgestrel-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levonorgestrel</a> 100 mcg. In March 2013, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Quartette, which also contains 84 active tablets of ethinyl estradiol (doses increase from 20 mcg to 25 mcg to 30 mcg in each pack) and levonorgestrel 150 mcg, followed by seven placebo pills. Use of this ascending estrogen dose extended oral contraceptive may be associated with less unscheduled bleeding than the formulations detailed above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormonal-contraception-for-suppression-of-menstruation/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Lybrel (ethinyl estradiol 20 mcg and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levonorgestrel-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levonorgestrel</a> 90 mcg, available as a generic) is the first low-dose combination OC designed to be taken 365 days a year, without a placebo phase or hormone-free interval. Contraceptive efficacy is similar to that of other OCs. In two phase III clinical trials, after one year of use, 53 and 59 percent of women achieved amenorrhea (defined as absence of all bleeding and spotting) and 20 and 26 percent experienced spotting that did not require any sanitary protection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormonal-contraception-for-suppression-of-menstruation/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Adverse events and discontinuations were comparable to those reported for cyclic OC regimens, except for a higher rate of unscheduled bleeding with the continuous regimen (21 versus 12 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormonal-contraception-for-suppression-of-menstruation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]). Endometrial histology after at least six months of use showed inactive or benign endometrium in most women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormonal-contraception-for-suppression-of-menstruation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. After discontinuation of pill use, the median time to return to menses was 32 days, and spontaneous menses or pregnancy by day 90 occurred in 98.9 percent of women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormonal-contraception-for-suppression-of-menstruation/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In addition, a phase III trial reported that 18 of 21 women (86 percent) conceived within 13 months after discontinuation of treatment, providing additional support that prolonged continuous use of OCs does not delay the return to fertility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormonal-contraception-for-suppression-of-menstruation/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Extended use of other combination pills (eg, ethinyl <span class=\"nowrap\">estradiol/drospirenone)</span> also appears to be safe and effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormonal-contraception-for-suppression-of-menstruation/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p>Unscheduled <span class=\"nowrap\">bleeding/spotting</span> often occurs during the first few months of extended OC use, but then resolves. If troublesome unscheduled bleeding occurs after the first 21 days of hormone use, one approach is to stop the OC for three days to allow withdrawal bleeding and then resume taking the pills for at least 21 days of continuous use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormonal-contraception-for-suppression-of-menstruation/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. This approach of scheduling a short hormone-free interval can be repeated whenever bothersome breakthrough bleeding occurs, as long as the patient has taken at least 21 days of active pills continuously before proceeding with a hormone-free interval. Over time, breakthrough bleeding episodes will become spaced out and stop. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-unscheduled-bleeding-in-women-using-contraception\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of unscheduled bleeding in women using contraception&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Transdermal and transvaginal estrogen-progestin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The transdermal contraceptive patch (commercial name Xulane) is applied weekly for three weeks; the vaginal contraceptive ring is inserted for three weeks duration. For both methods, uterine bleeding occurs during the fourth week when the method is discontinued. As with estrogen-progestin pills, cyclic use of these methods is a reasonable first-line therapy if the goal is reduction, but not necessarily elimination, of monthly blood flow. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transdermal-contraceptive-patch\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transdermal contraceptive patch&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=contraceptive-vaginal-ring\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Contraceptive vaginal ring&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Both the patch and vaginal ring can be used continuously, but amenorrhea rates appear to be lower compared with continuous-use contraceptive pills, depot <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medroxyprogesterone-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">medroxyprogesterone acetate</a> injections, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levonorgestrel-systemic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levonorgestrel</a> intrauterine devices.

However, unscheduled bleeding and spotting days were common in both groups. Because serum ethinyl estradiol levels are higher with the patch than with OCs or the ring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormonal-contraception-for-suppression-of-menstruation/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>], we avoid continuous use of the transdermal contraceptive patch because of a possible increase in risk of venous thromboembolism in patch users compared with OC users. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transdermal-contraceptive-patch#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transdermal contraceptive patch&quot;, section on 'Extended cycle use'</a>.)</p><p>Data on continuous use of the vaginal ring are also limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormonal-contraception-for-suppression-of-menstruation/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. In one trial evaluating an extended vaginal ring regimen, extended use resulted in fewer overall days of bleeding than monthly use, but there was an increase in unscheduled spotting days compared with the predictable cycle of the 28-day regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormonal-contraception-for-suppression-of-menstruation/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In another trial that compared extended use of the vaginal ring with extended use of an oral contraceptive, over a one-year period, both methods significantly reduced the total number of scheduled and unscheduled <span class=\"nowrap\">bleeding/spotting</span> days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormonal-contraception-for-suppression-of-menstruation/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Extended cycle ring users had fewer unscheduled <span class=\"nowrap\">bleeding/spotting</span> days than extended-cycle OC users (21 versus 22.5 days over one year), but more scheduled <span class=\"nowrap\">bleeding/spotting</span> days (17.5 versus 16.5 over one year).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Progestin contraceptives</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Long-term use of the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levonorgestrel-intrauterine-device-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levonorgestrel intrauterine device</a> and depot <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medroxyprogesterone-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">medroxyprogesterone acetate</a> contraceptive injections are associated with high rates of amenorrhea, although unscheduled spotting and bleeding are common in the first few months of use.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Levonorgestrel intrauterine contraception</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine devices (LNg IUD) are an alternative modality for reducing the frequency and volume of menstrual blood loss.

Therefore, ovulation-related symptoms are less likely to be improved by this device. However, it is a good choice for reducing uterine bleeding in women with hemostatic disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormonal-contraception-for-suppression-of-menstruation/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>] and those in whom estrogen is either contraindicated or causes health concerns.

Fifty to 75 percent of women who use DMPA for one year experience amenorrhea, which becomes more common as the duration of use increases. Thus, prolonged use of this agent enhances reduction of menstruation-related symptoms. DMPA is given by intramuscular or subcutaneous (formulations differ by intended route) injection at 90-day intervals. DMPA is discussed in detail in a separate topic. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=depot-medroxyprogesterone-acetate-for-contraception\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate for contraception&quot;</a>.)</p><p>DMPA is a good choice for inducing amenorrhea in women in whom estrogen-progestin contraceptives or the LNg IUD are either contraindicated or cause additional health concerns. Initial irregular bleeding is the most common adverse effect. Additional adverse effects, such as acne or other skin problems (related to its androgenicity), headache, and depression, resulted in discontinuation by one year in over 70 percent of women in one review [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormonal-contraception-for-suppression-of-menstruation/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Although there is an association between current use of DMPA and decreased bone mineral density, bone density returns to normal after cessation of therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=depot-medroxyprogesterone-acetate-for-contraception\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate for contraception&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Return of fertility upon discontinuation of contraceptive injections may be delayed compared with other methods. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=depot-medroxyprogesterone-acetate-for-contraception#H1270312\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate for contraception&quot;, section on 'Return to fertility after discontinuation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h3\">Progestin implant</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The progestin implant is less satisfactory for suppression of menstruation than the other methods discussed above. During the first two years of use of the single-rod <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etonogestrel-implant-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etonogestrel implant</a> (commercial name Nexplanon), 22 percent of women developed amenorrhea, 34 percent had fewer than three <span class=\"nowrap\">bleeding/spotting</span> episodes in 90 days, and the remainder had frequent or prolonged episodes of uterine bleeding. In contrast with women using 52 mg LNg IUD or depot <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medroxyprogesterone-acetate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">medroxyprogesterone acetate</a> injections, amenorrhea does not increase with ongoing duration of implant use. The implant is approved for up to three years of contraception. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etonogestrel-contraceptive-implant\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etonogestrel contraceptive implant&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5104153\"><span class=\"h3\">Norethindrone acetate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norethindrone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norethindrone</a> acetate (NETA) (5 mg tablets taken orally one to three times per day) also reduces menstrual blood loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormonal-contraception-for-suppression-of-menstruation/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. In one study, blood loss was reduced by 87 percent in women with idiopathic menorrhagia given this drug [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormonal-contraception-for-suppression-of-menstruation/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. However, none of these women experienced amenorrhea during the three-month study period, and only about one-quarter elected to continue with the treatment once the study ended. When compared to the LNg IUD, the two therapies produced an equivalent reduction in menstrual blood loss, but patient satisfaction was much higher with the IUD (76 versus 22 percent after three cycles).</p><p>In our experience, a lower dose of NETA (5 mg orally daily) reduces blood loss and often results in amenorrhea in women suffering from heavy menstrual bleeding, including those with uterine fibroids or anovulatory uterine bleeding. We find that continuous, rather than cyclical, use of NETA is most effective in reducing or eliminating heavy menstrual bleeding, and represents an easier regimen for compliance. Because 5 mg of NETA represents a high dose of a potent progestin, its use is often associated with unpleasant mood symptoms, increased appetite, and bloating. Although available as a generic, NETA is more costly than OCs or DMPA. Of note, this dose is higher than that required for contraception. For example, commonly used estrogen-progestin contraceptives contain <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norethindrone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norethindrone</a> acetate 1 mg daily. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Other drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hormonal agents other than contraceptives can be used to suppress menstruation. These are generally used when there is a specific medical indication. These drugs are costly, often have significant side effects, and may not universally suppress ovulation; therefore a less effective nonhormonal contraceptive may be necessary and ovulation related symptoms may not subside. Some examples are:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2707899\"><span class=\"h3\">Postmenopausal hormone therapy formulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A postmenopausal estrogen-progestin formulation can be used off-label to suppress menstruation. This is oral ethinyl estradiol (EE) 5 mcg combined with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=norethindrone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">norethindrone</a> acetate (NETA) 1 mg (available as a 28-day continuous formulation, eg, Jinteli <span class=\"nowrap\">1/5</span> and other generics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hormonal-contraception-for-suppression-of-menstruation/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]), which is marketed for treatment of menopausal symptoms. Because of its low estrogen dose, some clinicians prescribe this <span class=\"nowrap\">1/5</span> menopausal formulation off-label to premenopausal women desiring menstrual suppression when combination estrogen-progestin OCs are contraindicated. Many premenopausal users develop amenorrhea during use of this <span class=\"nowrap\">1/5</span> formulation. Because the dose of norethindrone acetate is lower, this <span class=\"nowrap\">EE/NETA</span> formulation causes fewer undesirable progestin-related side effects than NETA 5 mg tablets. Although the 1 mg dose of NETA is sufficient to prevent ovulation (and in fact is higher than the dose in some marketed OCs), this <span class=\"nowrap\">1/5</span> formulation is not approved for use as a contraceptive and consistent back-up contraception (eg condom use) should be recommended if this formulation is prescribed to women who need birth control.

Users of the estrogen-progestin pill, transdermal patch, or vaginal ring should not have any contraindications to use of contraceptive doses of estrogen.
