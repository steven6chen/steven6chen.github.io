Data from the Framingham Heart Study and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) have shown that the systolic pressure rises and the diastolic pressure falls after age 60 years in both normotensive and untreated hypertensive subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-older-adults-particularly-isolated-systolic-hypertension/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] and that ISH accounts for 60 to 80 percent of cases of hypertension in older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-older-adults-particularly-isolated-systolic-hypertension/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Furthermore, the systolic and pulse pressures appear to be the major predictors of coronary disease in older adults; in contrast, diastolic pressure is the major predictor under age 50 years, and all three indices were equal predictors between the ages of 50 and 59 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-older-adults-particularly-isolated-systolic-hypertension/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>The elevation in pulse pressure in patients with ISH is primarily due to diminished arterial compliance.

Even in patients who also have diastolic hypertension, the cardiovascular risk correlates more closely with the systolic than the diastolic blood pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-older-adults-particularly-isolated-systolic-hypertension/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Importance of diastolic pressure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among older adults, coronary heart disease risk varies directly with the systolic and pulse pressures and inversely with the diastolic pressure (ie, lower diastolic pressures are associated with increased risk) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-older-adults-particularly-isolated-systolic-hypertension/abstract/5,11,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,11,16,17</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=increased-pulse-pressure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Increased pulse pressure&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, the observations concerning worse outcomes in older adult patients with lower diastolic pressures primarily came from population studies or from baseline blood pressures in clinical trials, not after treatment in clinical trials. In the SHEP trial, for example, the mean baseline blood pressure was <span class=\"nowrap\">170/77</span> mmHg and the attained blood pressure was <span class=\"nowrap\">143/68</span> mmHg in the treated group and <span class=\"nowrap\">155/72</span> in the placebo group; the mean age was 72 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-older-adults-particularly-isolated-systolic-hypertension/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Despite the low attained diastolic pressure, the treated group had significantly better outcomes, including fewer coronary heart disease events. A similar mean systolic blood pressure and higher diastolic blood pressure <span class=\"nowrap\">(143/78</span> mmHg) were attained in the treated group in the HYVET trial of the very old (mean age 84 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-older-adults-particularly-isolated-systolic-hypertension/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'SHEP trial'</a> below and <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'HYVET trial'</a> below.)</p><p>When treating older adult patients with isolated systolic hypertension, there are no clear data that provide guidance related to the minimum diastolic blood pressure that can be tolerated. An analysis from the SHEP trial found significant increases in cardiovascular events in the active treatment group when the diastolic blood pressure was &le;60 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-older-adults-particularly-isolated-systolic-hypertension/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In other reports of treated patients, an increase in risk of stroke began at diastolic pressures below 65 mmHg in a report from the observational Rotterdam study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-older-adults-particularly-isolated-systolic-hypertension/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>] and, in the INVEST trial of hypertensive patients with coronary artery disease who were randomly assigned to a verapamil- or atenolol-based strategy, an increased risk of myocardial infarction that began at diastolic pressures between 61 and 70 mmHg and increased approximately 2.5-fold further at diastolic pressures &le;60 mmHg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-older-adults-particularly-isolated-systolic-hypertension/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>These observations do not prove a cause-and-effect relationship between lower diastolic pressures and adverse outcomes. In a meta-analysis that included two trials of isolated systolic hypertension, a J-shaped curve for mortality was noted with both systolic pressure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F80901\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80901 \">figure 1</a>) and diastolic pressure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F73430\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73430 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-older-adults-particularly-isolated-systolic-hypertension/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. However, a J-curve was seen in treated and untreated patients and was not specific for cardiovascular mortality. The authors concluded that the J-curve is probably explained by poor health associated with lower blood pressures, not an adverse effect of antihypertensive therapy.</p><p>In summary, although adverse outcomes that can be ascribed only to excessive blood pressure lowering with antihypertensive drugs are probably not common in patients with isolated systolic hypertension, cardiovascular events can occur if the diastolic pressure is reduced below the level needed to maintain perfusion to vital organs, particularly the heart. We suggest a minimum posttreatment diastolic pressure, when using typical office-based measurements, of 60 mmHg overall.

As noted below, the benefits from more intensive blood pressure lowering were present in fit, less fit, and frail older adult patients.

The adjusted hazard ratio for death was greater for those who had a systolic pressure less than 130 mmHg while being treated with two or more drugs compared with the other three groups (HR 1.78, 95% CI 1.34-2.37).

However, older hypertensives are more likely to be frail, to have orthostatic hypotension, and to have lower diastolic blood pressures than younger hypertensive patients, all of which may limit antihypertensive therapy. (See <a href=\"#H154681933\" class=\"local\">'Problem of orthostatic hypotension'</a> above.)</p><p>Thus, while substantial progress has been made in closing the gap in hypertension control between all younger and older adults with hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-older-adults-particularly-isolated-systolic-hypertension/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>], it may not be possible or prudent to fully close the gap. However, the combination of antihypertensive therapy and lifestyle modifications described above should result in blood pressure control in a greater proportion of older patients.

These patients accounted for 28 percent of treated patients with uncontrolled hypertension in 2005 to 2008, which represented an increase from 16 percent in 1988 to 1994. Clinical characteristics associated with resistant hypertension included older age, obesity, chronic kidney disease, and a Framingham 10-year coronary risk score of more than 20 percent.</p><p>Issues related to resistant hypertension, including the general approach to therapy, are discussed in detail elsewhere.

Goal blood pressure, and specifically our recommended goal blood pressure for different patient populations, is discussed in detail elsewhere. In general, however, our recommendation for most hypertensive older adults is to attain a systolic pressure of 125 to 135 mmHg if standard manual blood pressure measurements are used, or a systolic pressure of 120 to 125 mmHg if unattended, automated oscillometric measurements are used. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-pressure-measurement-in-the-diagnosis-and-management-of-hypertension-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blood pressure measurement in the diagnosis and management of hypertension in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=goal-blood-pressure-in-adults-with-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Goal blood pressure in adults with hypertension&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hypertension-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hypertension in patients with diabetes mellitus&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antihypertensive-therapy-and-progression-of-nondiabetic-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antihypertensive therapy and progression of nondiabetic chronic kidney disease in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antihypertensive-therapy-to-prevent-recurrent-stroke-or-transient-ischemic-attack\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antihypertensive therapy to prevent recurrent stroke or transient ischemic attack&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Goal blood pressure in older adults was examined in the Systolic Pressure Intervention Trial (SPRINT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-older-adults-particularly-isolated-systolic-hypertension/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. SPRINT enrolled a subgroup of more than 2600 ambulatory adults aged 75 years or older with a baseline blood pressure of <span class=\"nowrap\">142/71</span> mmHg (consistent with isolated systolic hypertension), including 349 categorized as being fit, 1456 as less fit, and 815 as frail according to a validated frailty index. At 3.1 years, rates of both the primary cardiovascular endpoint and all-cause mortality were significantly lower among those assigned more intensive (goal of &lt;120 mmHg; mean achieved unattended systolic blood pressure 123) versus less intensive (goal of &lt;140 mmHg; mean achieved attended systolic blood pressure 135) systolic blood pressure lowering (2.6 versus 3.8 percent and 1.8 versus 2.6 percent, respectively). The benefit from more intensive blood pressure control was present in both fit and frail older adults. Serious adverse events were similar in the two treatment groups and did not depend upon frailty.</p><p>A meta-analysis of 10,857 hypertensive adults aged 65 years or older combined these results from SPRINT with three other large randomized goal blood pressure trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-older-adults-particularly-isolated-systolic-hypertension/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. After a mean follow up of 3.1 years, more intensive, versus less intensive, blood pressure lowering reduced the rates of major adverse cardiovascular events (3.7 versus 5.2 percent), cardiovascular mortality (1.1 versus 1.7 percent), and heart failure (1.3 versus 2.0 percent). Rates of stroke and myocardial infarction were also lower, but the results were not statistically significant.</p><p>Blood pressure goals may not be easy to achieve, particularly in older patients with a baseline systolic pressure greater than 160 mmHg. If attaining goal blood pressure proves difficult or overly burdensome for the patient, the systolic pressure that is reached with two or three antihypertensive agents (even if above target) may be a reasonable interim goal. Once maximally tolerated therapy is reached and blood pressure control remains suboptimal, then additional efforts to engage older adults in healthful lifestyle change can facilitate better blood pressure control.</p><p>One potential limitation to achieving goal blood pressure is that lowering the blood pressure may impair mental function, leading to manifestations such as confusion or sleepiness. In such patients, antihypertensive therapy should be reduced, and the systolic pressure should be allowed to rise to a level at which these symptoms resolve.</p><p>Another concern when treating older adult patients with isolated systolic hypertension is that the low diastolic pressure after therapy may impair tissue perfusion (particularly coronary perfusion) and possibly increase cardiovascular risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-older-adults-particularly-isolated-systolic-hypertension/abstract/5,11,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,11,16,17</a>]. However, as noted above, lower diastolic blood pressures are associated with worse outcomes (both cardiovascular and noncardiovascular) in both treated and untreated patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F73430\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73430 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-older-adults-particularly-isolated-systolic-hypertension/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. These findings suggest that the worse outcomes are probably explained by poor health associated with lower blood pressures, not an adverse effect of antihypertensive therapy. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Importance of diastolic pressure'</a> above.)</p><p>Despite these observations, there may be a threshold diastolic blood pressure below which adverse cardiovascular outcomes might increase in older adult patients. When treating patients with isolated systolic hypertension, we and others (including JNC-7) suggest a minimum posttreatment diastolic pressure of 60 mmHg (using office-based blood pressure) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-hypertension-in-older-adults-particularly-isolated-systolic-hypertension/abstract/20,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3019491480\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Isolated systolic hypertension (ISH), which is common in older adults, has been often defined as a systolic blood pressure equal to or above 160 mmHg, with a diastolic blood pressure below 90 mmHg. Some expert panels, however, have defined 130 mmHg as the upper limit of normal at all ages. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Isolated systolic hypertension'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Older hypertensive patients should attempt lifestyle modification to lower the blood pressure. If goal blood pressure is not attained with lifestyle modification, antihypertensive therapy should be initiated. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Lifestyle modifications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the absence of a hypertensive emergency or urgency, blood pressure reduction should always be gradual in older adults. All patients should receive nonpharmacologic therapy, particularly dietary salt restriction and weight loss in obese patients. Drug therapy should be started if lifestyle changes are not sufficient. A potential limiting factor to the use of antihypertensive drugs is that orthostatic (postural) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> postprandial hypotension is common among older hypertensive patients. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Lifestyle modifications'</a> above and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Drug therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among older hypertensive patients who require antihypertensive medication and who do not have an indication for a specific drug, we recommend initial monotherapy with a low-dose thiazide-type diuretic, a long-acting calcium channel blocker, or an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) <span class=\"nowrap\">inhibitor/angiotensin</span> II receptor blocker (ARB) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). A long-acting dihydropyridine or a thiazide diuretic is generally preferred because of increased blood pressure-lowering efficacy in this population. Among older adult patients in whom there is a reasonable likelihood of requiring a second drug (eg, systolic pressure more than <span class=\"nowrap\">10/5</span> mmHg above goal), we suggest initial therapy with a long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). This is because, if additional therapy is required, a long-acting ACE <span class=\"nowrap\">inhibitor/ARB</span> can be added to achieve the desired combination regimen of a long-acting ACE <span class=\"nowrap\">inhibitor/ARB</span> plus a long-acting dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker.
