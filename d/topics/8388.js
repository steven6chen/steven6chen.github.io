Although rare, hydrocarbon aspiration may cause death secondary to respiratory failure. Hydrocarbons were implicated in almost 5 percent of all single substance fatalities in this pediatric population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydrocarbon-poisoning/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Gasoline, chlorofluorocarbon propellants, motor oils, lighter <span class=\"nowrap\">fluid/naphtha,</span> lamp oil, and mineral spirits, are the most commonly ingested substances [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydrocarbon-poisoning/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In young children, the ingestion typically occurs as a result of exploratory behavior. Frequently, the hydrocarbon is unsecured or improperly stored in a drinking container (eg, soda bottle). Moderate or major toxic effects are associated most commonly with ingestions of lamp oil, kerosene, lighter fluid, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> naphtha [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydrocarbon-poisoning/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. Toxicity in adolescents often arises from inhalant abuse of hydrocarbons. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=inhalant-abuse-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Inhalant abuse in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Product safety</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since 2001, the United States consumer product safety commission has required child-resistant packaging for products that have low viscosity and contain &ge;10 percent hydrocarbon by weight (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51981\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51981 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydrocarbon-poisoning/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In 1997, the European Union attempted to minimize lamp oil aspiration by setting standards for viscosity and surface tension, the main determinants of aspiration risk. A follow-up study in 2005 showed no effect on number or severity of hydrocarbon aspiration in the years since the directive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydrocarbon-poisoning/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSES OF HYDROCARBONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The four structural classes of hydrocarbons are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aromatic hydrocarbons</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aliphatic hydrocarbons</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Halogenated hydrocarbons</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Terpene hydrocarbons</p><p/><p>Aromatic hydrocarbons are cyclic compounds containing a benzene ring (eg, benzene, toluene, and xylene). They are used primarily in solvents, glues, nail polishes, paints, and paint removers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydrocarbon-poisoning/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Halogenated hydrocarbons are fluorinated, chlorinated, or brominated (eg, methylene chloride, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene). The terpenes include turpentine and pine oil. The aliphatic hydrocarbons are petroleum distillates such as gasoline, kerosene, and naphtha. They are found in furniture polishes, lamp oil, and lighter fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydrocarbon-poisoning/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">HYDROCARBON TOXICITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hydrocarbons also can be classified according to their potential for toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydrocarbon-poisoning/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Low toxicity (unless complicated by gross aspiration)</strong> &ndash; Examples include asphalt, tars, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mineral-oil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mineral oil</a>, petroleum jelly, motor oil, and axle grease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Aspiration hazard</strong> &ndash; Clinical effects are typically limited to direct pulmonary damage and subsequent inflammation. Examples include turpentine, gasoline, kerosene, mineral seal oil (furniture polish), charcoal lighter fluid, mineral spirits, or outdoor torch and cigarette lighter fluids.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Systemic toxicity</strong> &ndash; Halogenated and aromatic hydrocarbons are absorbed readily through the gastrointestinal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> respiratory systems. Systemic effects include cardiac arrhythmias secondary to myocardial sensitization and central nervous system (CNS) depression. Systemic toxicity also occurs after ingestion of compounds that combine aliphatic hydrocarbons with toxic additives (eg, organophosphates, heavy metals, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=camphor-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">camphor</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Determinants of pulmonary aspiration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The aspiration hazard of the hydrocarbons is determined by three properties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydrocarbon-poisoning/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Volatility</strong> &ndash; The ability to vaporize or to exist in a gaseous form. The greater the volatility, the greater the risk of pulmonary absorption and CNS depression.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Surface tension</strong> &ndash; The adherence (or cohesiveness) of molecules along a liquid surface. Lower surface tension allows compounds to spread or &quot;creep&quot; over a larger area.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Viscosity</strong> &ndash; The resistance to flow through an orifice or the tendency of a compound to resist &quot;stirring&quot;. Lower viscosity facilitates deeper penetration into the tracheobronchial tree.</p><p/><p>The aspiration hazard of hydrocarbons is inversely related to viscosity and surface tension and directly related to volatility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydrocarbon-poisoning/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Thus, hydrocarbons with decreased viscosity, low surface tension, and high volatility are more likely to be aspirated and cause pulmonary injury. The low viscosity permits greater penetration into the distal airways while the low surface tension facilitates spread over a larger area. As an example, simple petroleum distillates (kerosene, gasoline, liquid furniture polish) are chiefly aspiration hazards. They have high potential to cause aspiration pneumonitis, but rarely cause systemic symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute systemic toxicity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute systemic toxicity following hydrocarbon exposure is most commonly seen with aromatic and halogenated hydrocarbons and is primarily determined by their volatility <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> degree of absorption from the gastrointestinal tract [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydrocarbon-poisoning/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Acute effects include central nervous system (CNS) depression (eg, lethargy, coma, inebriation), seizures, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ventricular arrhythmias caused by myocardial sensitization to endogenous and administered catecholamines (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>). In addition, hepatic and acute renal tubular necrosis has been described after poisoning with halogenated hydrocarbons, especially carbon tetrachloride.</p><p>Gases such as methane, ethane, propane, and butane cause asphyxia by replacing alveolar gas and are readily absorbed into the circulatory system. After absorption, they also have the potential to cause CNS depression, seizures, and ventricular arrhythmias due to myocardial sensitization to catecholamines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydrocarbon-poisoning/abstract/6,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8</a>].</p><p>Other hydrocarbons have specific CNS effects after ingestion including CNS depression (pine oil, gasoline, naphtha) and seizures (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=camphor-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">camphor</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydrocarbon-poisoning/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p>Systemic absorption is not a major contributor to pulmonary injury except in the setting of massive ingestion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydrocarbon-poisoning/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hydrocarbon aspiration impacts the respiratory and central nervous systems. The respiratory system is primarily affected by direct injury. Low viscosity, low surface tension, and solvent properties of aspirated hydrocarbons together determine a compound's ability to cause chemical pneumonitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydrocarbon-poisoning/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. The primary pathologic finding is severe necrotizing pneumonia. Other findings include direct destruction of the airway epithelium, alveolar septae, and pulmonary capillaries, as well as solubilization of the lipid surfactant layer. Secondary changes include atelectasis, interstitial inflammation, and hyaline membrane formation. The inflammatory response from chemical irritation generally causes temperature elevation, usually within hours of exposure.</p><p>Volatile hydrocarbons are highly lipid soluble. They enter the circulation through the lungs and rapidly diffuse throughout the body and into the central nervous system (CNS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydrocarbon-poisoning/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Neurons, which have a high lipid content, are particularly susceptible to the solvent properties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydrocarbon-poisoning/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. CNS manifestations also occur secondary to severe pulmonary injury and hypoxia. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Acute systemic toxicity'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial presentation and diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients who ingest aliphatic hydrocarbons (eg, kerosene, pine oil) are children who are initially asymptomatic and have a history of exposure. Those patients with symptoms (eg, respiratory distress, hypoxemia) soon after ingestion typically progress rapidly to respiratory failure.</p><p>When history of hydrocarbon exposure is lacking, characteristic odors can help identify the presence and type of hydrocarbons ingested:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kerosene and other aliphatic hydrocarbons &ndash; Petroleum distillate odor</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pine oil &ndash; Pine scent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Halogenated hydrocarbons &ndash; Sweet solvent odor</p><p/><p>Although exposure to some hydrocarbons may be confirmed by detection of urinary metabolites (eg, trichloroethanol after chlorinated hydrocarbon exposure, hippuric acid after toluene exposure) or directly measured in the blood (eg, toluene), these laboratory studies are not rapidly available and do not change management priorities. Thus the diagnosis of hydrocarbon exposure is based upon clinical features.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical findings after hydrocarbon exposure</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Vital signs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Between 30 and 60 percent of patients with hydrocarbon aspiration have fever at the time of presentation (38 to 40&ordm;C (100.4 to 104&ordm;F)) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydrocarbon-poisoning/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Persistence beyond 48 hours suggests bacterial superinfection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydrocarbon-poisoning/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Pulse oximetry may show decreased oxygen saturation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Respiratory</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pulmonary manifestations secondary to aspiration generally occur within 30 minutes, although their onset may be delayed for 12 to 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydrocarbon-poisoning/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Immediate signs of aspiration include coughing, choking, gagging, and vomiting. </p><p>Respiratory examination findings vary with the degree of pulmonary injury and may include tachypnea, dyspnea, cyanosis, wheezing, diminished resonance on percussion, suppressed or tubular breath sounds, rales, nasal flaring, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> grunting respirations. Displacement of alveolar gas by vaporized hydrocarbon may aggravate hypoxemia caused by inflammation and edema.</p><p>The major pulmonary complications of hydrocarbon aspiration include asphyxia, necrotizing chemical pneumonitis, lipoid pneumonia, and hemorrhagic pulmonary edema, which quickly progresses to shock and respiratory arrest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydrocarbon-poisoning/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Pneumothorax, subcutaneous emphysema of the chest wall, and pleural effusion, including empyema, may also occur. Secondary bacterial or viral infection may exacerbate the chemical pneumonitis.

In addition, hypoxia caused by hydrocarbon aspiration may cause secondary CNS toxicity, including drowsiness, tremors, or seizures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydrocarbon-poisoning/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

Orogastric and intestinal irritation may be associated with nausea and hematemesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydrocarbon-poisoning/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

Hemolysis, hemoglobinuria, and consumptive coagulopathy rarely occur after large ingestions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydrocarbon-poisoning/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Ancillary studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children who ingest hydrocarbons should receive a chest radiograph four to six hours after exposure or sooner if they show signs of pulmonary aspiration (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F70145\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef70145 \">algorithm 1</a>).</p><p>Symptomatic patients should also undergo measurement of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood gas</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complete blood count</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum glucose</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serum electrolytes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinalysis</p><p/><p>In addition to these studies, those children exposed to halogenated hydrocarbons should have measures of liver injury (aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT)) and renal function (blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine) performed.</p><p>The initial blood gas findings after hydrocarbon aspiration typically show a mild respiratory alkalosis with hypoxemia. If hypoxemia is not corrected, the patient will later develop a metabolic acidosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Radiographic findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients who ultimately manifest pulmonary aspiration after hydrocarbon ingestion, the radiographic findings of hydrocarbon aspiration are evident within two hours of exposure in 88 percent and by 12 hours in 98 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydrocarbon-poisoning/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. These findings frequently precede the development of physical findings. </p><p>Initial radiograph findings consist of multiple, small, patchy densities with ill-defined margins (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71987\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef71987 \">image 1</a>). The lesions become larger and coalesce as the injury progresses. In some cases, the radiographic findings may be minimal at a few hours and then rapidly progress to extensive infiltrates. Emphysema or pneumothorax may develop. Radiographic abnormalities typically peak between two and eight hours after aspiration. The resolution of radiographic changes is gradual and lags behind clinical improvement, which usually occurs three to five days after aspiration. Pneumatoceles may develop during this latent period.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinician should consider the following alternative diagnoses when hydrocarbon exposure is not certain or is associated with findings suggestive of other poisonings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bronchopneumonia </strong>&ndash; Patients with bronchopneumonia typically have fever and tachypnea and may appear similar to patients with hydrocarbon aspiration. However, patients with pneumonia do not display a characteristic petroleum distillate odor and do not have findings of chemical pneumonitis on chest radiograph (see <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Initial presentation and diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Radiographic findings'</a> above).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Salicylate overdose</strong> &ndash; Patients who have ingested salicylates may have fever and tachypnea with altered mental status but typically do not have abnormal chest radiographs soon after ingestion. Some clinicians may think the fruity odor of ketoacidosis is similar to that caused by halogenated hydrocarbon ingestion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other toxins</strong> &ndash; Any toxin that produces metabolic acidosis (eg, iron, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoniazid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoniazid</a>, toxic alcohol) or cellular hypoxia (eg, carbon monoxide, cyanide) may cause tachypnea. Blood gas measurement will often differentiate these toxins from hydrocarbon exposure with its typical respiratory alkalosis, and in more serious cases, arterial blood hypoxemia.</p><p/><p>Hydrocarbons are sometimes used as solvents for other dangerous toxins (eg, organophosphates). Thus, the clinician should seek to identify the exact compound that was ingested when managing a patient with hydrocarbon poisoning to ensure timely recognition and treatment of all possible toxic agents.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Successful management of hydrocarbon aspiration requires recognition of pulmonary toxicity and rapid initiation of appropriate supportive care.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Stabilization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial treatment depends upon the degree of immediate toxicity, including the presence of respiratory distress and altered mental status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hydrocarbon-poisoning/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with severe respiratory distress, unresponsive to oxygen and beta-2 bronchodilators (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albuterol-salbutamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">albuterol</a>) or significant altered mental status (lethargy, coma) shortly after hydrocarbon ingestion should undergo endotracheal intubation.
