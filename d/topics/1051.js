The primary goal of antibiotic stewardship is to optimize clinical outcomes while minimizing unintended consequences of antibiotic use. Additional benefits include improving susceptibility rates to targeted antibiotics and optimizing resource utilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-stewardship-in-hospital-settings/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) promotes implementation of antibiotic stewardship programs that will impact antibiotic prescribers in United States health care facilities that receive CMS funding <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> Joint Commission accreditation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-stewardship-in-hospital-settings/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>]. The program is described in a &quot;playbook&quot; that is designed to help facilities implement the CDC Core Elements of Hospital Antibiotic Stewardship Programs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-stewardship-in-hospital-settings/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The primary goal is to promote &quot;smart use&quot; of antibiotics in the face of data demonstrating substantial overuse. Measurement of outcomes will be performed by comparing health care facilities of similar size and patient populations. Interventions to achieve this goal are discussed in the following sections.</p><p>Effective in 2017, the Joint Commission requires that all hospitals and nursing care centers have antimicrobial stewardship programs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-stewardship-in-hospital-settings/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. As of 2017, however, only 48 percent of hospitals have such a program [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-stewardship-in-hospital-settings/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Implementation of antimicrobial stewardship programs in small hospitals (&lt;200 beds) often requires confronting a number of barriers, such as a lack of dedicated staff trained in infectious diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-stewardship-in-hospital-settings/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Potential solutions include pooling of resources among hospitals, utilizing the resources of a larger healthcare system if feasible, taking advantage of state health department resources, and use of telehealth activities.</p><p>Issues related to hospital-based stewardship are reviewed here. Issues related to outpatient antibiotic stewardship are discussed separately.

Administration of an antibiotic course to a patient exposes the approximately 10<sup>12</sup> bacteria (the microbiome) in that patient to selective pressure, which may alter the intestinal microbiota for as long as a year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-stewardship-in-hospital-settings/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p>The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated in 2013 that, each year, two million infections caused by antibiotic-resistant pathogens occur in the United States, resulting in 23,000 deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-stewardship-in-hospital-settings/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H86737169\"><span class=\"h1\">PRINCIPLES OF OPTIMAL ANTIBIOTIC USE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, management of patients with suspected or proven bacterial infection consists of initiation of empiric therapy (ie, prior to availability of definitive microbiology data), followed by adjustment once microbiology data become available.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4282890984\"><span class=\"h2\">Initiating empiric therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initiation of empiric antibacterial therapy consists of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Choosing the optimal antibiotic regimen (after obtaining culture[s] from relevant sites), taking into consideration:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The severity and trajectory of illness</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The likely pathogens and their anatomic source (with consideration of source control), based on information from Gram stain and other rapid tests as appropriate</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The likelihood of drug resistance (eg, known colonization with resistant pathogens, recent antibiotic use, exposure to healthcare facilities, local resistance patterns)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Host factors, including those that may preclude use of a particular antibiotic class (eg, allergy), increase the risk of toxicity (eg, marginal or unstable renal function), or influence spectrum of coverage (eg, immunocompromise)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Determining the appropriate dosing and route of administration (eg, intravenous in the critically ill)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initiating antibiotic therapy as promptly as possible</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2703734639\"><span class=\"h2\">Tailoring antibiotic therapy (&quot;antibiotic time-out&quot;)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients receiving empiric antibiotic therapy, the regimen should be reevaluated on a continuing basis as the clinical status evolves and microbiology results become available (often after 48 to 72 hours). At this point, an &quot;antibiotic time-out&quot; should be performed, in which microbiology results are reviewed and antibiotic therapy is adjusted from empiric to definitive antibiotic therapy. The spectrum of coverage may be narrowed or broadened as appropriate, the dose may be adjusted as needed, and unnecessary components of the regimen should be eliminated. If it is apparent that the patient's clinical status is not the result of bacterial infection, antibiotics may be discontinued altogether. During the antibiotic time-out, the indication and duration of antibiotic therapy should be estimated and stated in the medical record.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H572481027\"><span class=\"h2\">Converting from intravenous to oral antibiotic administration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antibiotic regimens should be converted from intravenous to oral administration as soon as is feasible and clinically indicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-stewardship-in-hospital-settings/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. This intervention has been shown to decrease costs, facilitate discharges, and reduce complications associated with intravenous access without compromising clinical outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-stewardship-in-hospital-settings/abstract/19-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-23</a>].

The appropriate durations of therapy are well studied for a number of infectious disease syndromes, such as pneumonia, <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> infection and candidemia. Issues related to these syndromes are discussed separately (see related topics).</p><p>In addition, the use of serum procalcitonin measurements has been demonstrated to provide the clinician with confidence to discontinue therapy in critically ill patients with suspected bacterial infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-stewardship-in-hospital-settings/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]; in at least one study, this was associated with improved survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-stewardship-in-hospital-settings/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The use of procalcitonin in community-acquired pneumonia management is discussed separately.

The 2016 document &quot;Antibiotic Stewardship in Acute Care: A Practical Playbook&quot; provides examples of how to implement these principles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-stewardship-in-hospital-settings/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2216313737\"><span class=\"h1\">STEWARDSHIP PROGRAM INTERVENTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many antibiotic stewardship strategies have been shown to be effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-stewardship-in-hospital-settings/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]; programs should select interventions based on local antibiotic utilization patterns, available resources, and expertise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-stewardship-in-hospital-settings/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. In initiating a program, it is important to focus efforts and, when possible, to avoid implementing multiple interventions at the same time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-stewardship-in-hospital-settings/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1011493255\"><span class=\"h2\">Antibiotic oversight</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antibiotic oversight is the foundation of any stewardship program and should include one or both of the following strategies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-stewardship-in-hospital-settings/abstract/1,36,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,36,38</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prospective audit and feedback &ndash; In programs that utilize prospective audit and feedback (PAF), trained staff (typically stewardship pharmacists or infectious disease physicians) review antibiotic orders and provide verbal or written recommendations to prescribers regarding optimization of antibiotic use. The intervention does not delay the first dose of antibiotic therapy, and acceptance of recommendations is voluntary. With this approach, prescriber autonomy in clinical decision-making is preserved. Advantages and disadvantages of PAF are summarized in the Table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F107823\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107823 \">table 1</a>) and discussed further below. (See <a href=\"#H2967766506\" class=\"local\">'Prospective audit and feedback'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preauthorization &ndash; In programs that utilize preauthorization, approval is required (by an infectious disease physician or pharmacist) before certain antibiotic agents may be administered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-stewardship-in-hospital-settings/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. In some programs, the availability of certain antibiotics for specific indications is limited, and some antibiotics may be rendered to a non-formulary status. This approach provides an opportunity to optimize the initial choice of antibiotic therapy as well as an opportunity to educate individual prescribers about appropriate antibiotic use, which may affect subsequent use. Advantages and disadvantages of preauthorization are summarized in the Table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F107823\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107823 \">table 1</a>) and discussed further below. (See <a href=\"#H2003617983\" class=\"local\">'Preauthorization'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Few studies have compared these approaches and have yielded conflicting results. In one study, use of PAF was associated with greater reduction in antibiotic utilization than use of preauthorization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-stewardship-in-hospital-settings/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. In another report, transition to PAF from preauthorization was associated with increased utilization of three broad-spectrum antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-stewardship-in-hospital-settings/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p>Few studies have assessed the combined efficacy of preauthorization and PAF. In one institution where preauthorization was required for targeted antibiotics, retrospective review noted 30 percent of antibiotic use was inappropriate despite preauthorization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-stewardship-in-hospital-settings/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Another study noted that addition of preauthorization led to no significant reduction in <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> utilization beyond that attributed to the existing audit and feedback program [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-stewardship-in-hospital-settings/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2967766506\"><span class=\"h3\">Prospective audit and feedback</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PAF is defined above (see <a href=\"#H1011493255\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotic oversight'</a> above). Advantages and disadvantages of PAF are summarized in the Table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F107823\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef107823 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>PAF has been shown to reduce inappropriate antibiotic use in multiple settings, including intensive care units, long-term care facilities, and pediatric and community hospitals as well as in outpatient clinics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-stewardship-in-hospital-settings/abstract/43-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-46</a>]. It has been associated with cost savings and, in some cases, reduction in hospital-acquired infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-stewardship-in-hospital-settings/abstract/35,44,45,47-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,44,45,47-49</a>]. One study noted recommendation acceptance rates may improve when audit and feedback is part of an established stewardship program [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-stewardship-in-hospital-settings/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>PAF is time and labor intensive, and the scope may be limited by available resources. Therefore, some programs target specific patient groups (eg, those in the intensive care unit or those receiving broad-spectrum, high-cost, toxic, or multiple antibiotics). Thrice-weekly audit and feedback programs in community hospitals have been associated with reduced antibiotic utilization and cost savings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-stewardship-in-hospital-settings/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. Once-weekly programs targeting asymptomatic bacteriuria in long-term care facility residents also reduced antibiotic use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-stewardship-in-hospital-settings/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]; however, a minority of recommendations were accepted, and the authors concluded that more frequent interventions would be more effective.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2003617983\"><span class=\"h3\">Preauthorization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preauthorization is defined above (see <a href=\"#H1011493255\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotic oversight'</a> above).

Even in programs with high rates of antibiotic approval, preauthorization has been associated with decreased utilization of targeted antibiotics, suggesting preauthorization is also a passive barrier to prescribing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-stewardship-in-hospital-settings/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. The impact of preauthorization on antibiotic resistance is mixed; some studies have demonstrated an association with improved antibiotic susceptibilities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-stewardship-in-hospital-settings/abstract/51,52,56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52,56,57</a>], while others have shown no effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-stewardship-in-hospital-settings/abstract/58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59</a>].</p><p>Preauthorization programs are often associated with a perceived imposition on prescriber autonomy in clinical decision-making [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-stewardship-in-hospital-settings/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Verbal misrepresentation of relevant clinical data may lead to inappropriate recommendations, so direct chart review is needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-stewardship-in-hospital-settings/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Preauthorization is time and labor intensive and requires around-the-clock coverage. Some programs with limited resources allow a first dose of antibiotics in off-hours, with stewardship program review the following day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-stewardship-in-hospital-settings/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Other programs focus preauthorization resources on certain antibiotics that are misused commonly. Preauthorization can result in unintended increased use of other, nonrestricted antibiotics (&quot;squeezing the balloon&quot;), mitigating the intervention's effect on overall antibiotic use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-stewardship-in-hospital-settings/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>]. Thus, it is reasonable to monitor all antibiotic use after implementation of formulary restriction.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1613939157\"><span class=\"h2\">Facility-specific clinical protocols</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antibiotic stewardship programs should develop facility-specific clinical practice guidelines and pathways for common infections based on local epidemiology, susceptibility patterns, and drug availability or preference. Infectious disease syndromes include community-acquired pneumonia, urinary tract infections, skin and soft tissue infections, fever and neutropenia, and surgical prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-stewardship-in-hospital-settings/abstract/1,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,37</a>]. Implementation of inpatient pathways has been associated with more appropriate antibiotic use and reduced length of hospital stay, readmission, and cost [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-stewardship-in-hospital-settings/abstract/65-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">65-70</a>].</p><p>In many cases, clinical guidelines developed by national institutions are comprehensive, but their recommendations may be difficult to apply to individual patients. Institution-specific protocols can streamline information most relevant to daily practice into an easy-to-use format. Within these protocols, stewardship programs can highlight appropriate empiric therapy, reinforce deescalation of antibiotics based upon clinical and microbiologic data, encourage a switch from intravenous to oral therapy, and recommend an appropriate duration of therapy. Clinician involvement during the development process and promotion of the end product are critical.
