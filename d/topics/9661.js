A normal backbone (spine) has a slight curve. In a person with kyphosis, the upper part of the spine curves more than normal, causing a rounded or hunched back (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F83274\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83274 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p>Kyphosis is also called &quot;hyperkyphosis&quot; or &quot;dowager's hump.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H113224886\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes kyphosis in adults?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Kyphosis in adults happens because of problems with different parts of the spine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F86920\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86920 \">figure 2</a>). These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vertebrae &ndash; These are the bones of the spine that sit on top of one another like a stack of coins.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Discs &ndash; These are the rubbery cushions between each of the vertebrae.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscle, tendons, and ligaments &ndash; Together, these are known as the &quot;soft tissues&quot; of the back. These tissues support the back and help hold it together.</p><p/><p>The problems that can cause kyphosis include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Osteoporosis &ndash; This disease causes weak bones that break too easily. Tiny cracks or breaks in the vertebrae (called &quot;vertebral fractures&quot;) can cause the vertebrae to collapse or shrink.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Degenerative disc disease &ndash; This happens when the spinal discs start to shrink and break down.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weak muscles in the lower back &ndash; Weak back muscles can make it hard to stand up straight. This can cause slouching.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H113224903\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of kyphosis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main symptom is a hunched or rounded back that might hurt or feel stiff. People with kyphosis might also notice that their belly has gotten bigger even though they have not gained weight. Other possible symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neck or hip pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble swallowing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having acid that is normally in your stomach back up into your throat (a condition called &quot;acid reflux&quot;)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having a hard time doing everyday things, like walking, getting up from a chair, dressing, and bathing</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H113224918\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for kyphosis?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your doctor or nurse should be able to tell if you have it by doing an exam. But you will likely get a back X-ray and other tests to measure the curve of your back.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H113224933\"><span class=\"h1\">How is kyphosis treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment depends on what caused the problem and how serious it is. Treatments can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines for osteoporosis</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Exercises to stretch and strengthen the back</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to ease pain</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery &ndash; Doctors do surgery only if a person has trouble breathing or has very bad pain that does not get better with medicines or other treatments.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H113224948\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoporosis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Osteoporosis (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
