Amylin molecules aggregate and form amyloid fibers. Amyloid deposits composed of amylin are present in beta cells (hence the name amylin) and may contribute to the pathogenesis of diabetes. Like insulin, secretion is deficient in patients with diabetes. Like <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exenatide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">exenatide</a>, amylin inhibits glucagon secretion, delays gastric emptying, and promotes satiety. However, it does not stimulate insulin secretion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amylin-analogs-for-the-treatment-of-diabetes-mellitus#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Amylin analogs for the treatment of diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Pramlintide'</a>.)</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pramlintide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Pramlintide</a> is a stable analogue of amylin with similar pharmacologic properties but without the potential for aggregation.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pramlintide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Pramlintide</a> is approved for use in patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes who are treated with insulin but are not in acceptable metabolic control. Pramlintide cannot be mixed with insulin in the same syringe. Thus, the patient on pramlintide must inject pramlintide three times a day before each meal and also inject insulin separately.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pramlintide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Pramlintide</a> may cause hypoglycemia, especially in patients with type 1 diabetes. It causes nausea in approximately 30 percent of patients, reduces the glycated hemoglobin (A1C) value by only 0.5 to 0.7 percent, and is expensive. It produces modest weight loss, due at least in part to the gastrointestinal (GI) side effects. It is contraindicated in patients with gastroparesis. There is limited long-term experience with this agent.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pramlintide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Pramlintide</a> is not an appropriate therapy for the patient under consideration, because the patient is not taking insulin. It cannot be recommended, in general, for patients on insulin because of the considerations noted in the previous paragraph.</p><p>Return to the beginning to try again.
