Over 300,000 babies with SCD are born annually; the majority of these are in sub-Saharan Africa, where access to medical care and public health strategies to decrease mortality and morbidity are not uniformly available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-cell-disease-in-sub-saharan-africa/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>]. This number is expected to increase to up to 400,000 individuals by 2050 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-cell-disease-in-sub-saharan-africa/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The World Health Organization and United Nations have designated SCD as a global public health problem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-cell-disease-in-sub-saharan-africa/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. One of the World Federation of Public Health Associations millennium development goals was targeted at reducing child mortality by two-thirds between 1990 and 2015 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-cell-disease-in-sub-saharan-africa/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Despite the major interventions in malaria, HIV, and immunization, most of the 19 countries estimated to have a persistently high under-five mortality rate by 2015 (above 50 per 1000) are in Africa. We believe that the high prevalence of undiagnosed non-communicable diseases, including SCD, contribute to excess mortality in children under five years.</p><p>Half of the world&rsquo;s SCD population lives in three countries: Nigeria, India, and the Democratic Republic of Congo (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F106077\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef106077 \">figure 1</a>), where the disease affects up to 2 percent of the population, and the carrier prevalence rate (sickle cell trait) is as high as 10 to 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-cell-disease-in-sub-saharan-africa/abstract/4,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,9,10</a>]. Nigeria alone has been estimated to have at least 150,000 newborns born with SCD annually. Estimates are challenging because of the lack of federal newborn screening programs; however, approximately 700,000 births occur per year and the prevalence of SCD in newborns was 3 percent in a regional newborn screening program [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-cell-disease-in-sub-saharan-africa/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p>The regions of Africa with a high incidence of SCD are also associated with the highest density of malaria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-cell-disease-in-sub-saharan-africa/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Although the sickle mutation at one allele of the beta-globin gene (heterozygosity) confers a survival advantage in malaria endemic areas, especially for children, inheritance of the mutation at both alleles (HbSS) predisposes individuals to severe malaria and increased malaria mortality, as well as increased mortality from other complications of SCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-cell-disease-in-sub-saharan-africa/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. The role of heterozygosity for the sickle mutation in protection from falciparum malaria is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Protection against malaria in the hemoglobinopathies&quot;, section on 'Falciparum malaria and hemoglobin S'</a>.)</p><p>In high-income countries, the survival of individuals with SCD has been steadily increasing, often well into adulthood (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-and-prognosis-of-sickle-cell-disease#H21423841\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management and prognosis of sickle cell disease&quot;, section on 'Overall survival'</a>). In contrast, SCD-related childhood mortality in Africa remains as high as 50 to 90 percent, with fewer than half of affected children reaching their fifth birthday [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-cell-disease-in-sub-saharan-africa/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. An indication of the extremely high mortality rate throughout childhood and adolescence is the observation that adult prevalence of HbSS is 10-fold less than the birth incidence (0.2 to 0.3 percent versus 2 to 3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-cell-disease-in-sub-saharan-africa/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H243649\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF MANAGEMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Simple public health measures, such as newborn screening and parental education on how to detect splenic sequestration and when to bring a febrile child to medical attention, can have a dramatic impact on survival in children with SCD living in resource-poor countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-cell-disease-in-sub-saharan-africa/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Generally, the principles of management are as follows; these are discussed in more detail in the sections below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identification of newborns with SCD as soon after birth as possible (before the development of complications) &ndash; (See <a href=\"#H432682475\" class=\"local\">'Identifying affected individuals with SCD'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Education regarding when to seek medical attention &ndash; (See <a href=\"#H1806322\" class=\"local\">'Education'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Interventions to reduce infectious risk including vaccinations, penicillin, and malaria prophylaxis &ndash; (See <a href=\"#H1808631\" class=\"local\">'Bacterial infections (prophylaxis)'</a> below and <a href=\"#H204671\" class=\"local\">'Malaria (prophylaxis)'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prompt treatment of infections, especially invasive bacterial infections and malaria &ndash; (See <a href=\"#H1808329\" class=\"local\">'Bacterial infections (treatment)'</a> below and <a href=\"#H432682583\" class=\"local\">'Malaria (treatment)'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adequate pain control and hydration for vaso-occlusive pain &ndash; (See <a href=\"#H12701645\" class=\"local\">'Pain episodes'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When possible, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyurea</a> for vaso-occlusive complications, especially primary and secondary stroke prevention, administered at a fixed dose with monitoring as discussed below &ndash; (See <a href=\"#H12700447\" class=\"local\">'Stroke'</a> below and <a href=\"#H243231\" class=\"local\">'Hydroxyurea'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use of blood transfusions only when anemia is life threatening &ndash; (See <a href=\"#H243291\" class=\"local\">'Blood transfusion'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monitoring for chronic complications such as stroke, kidney disease, pulmonary hypertension, and <span class=\"nowrap\">asthma/chronic</span> lung disease; and close monitoring during pregnancy &ndash; (See <a href=\"#H86524403\" class=\"local\">'Prevention (stroke)'</a> below and <a href=\"#H6881965\" class=\"local\">'Renal complications'</a> below and <a href=\"#H6881972\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary complications'</a> below and <a href=\"#H6881882\" class=\"local\">'Pregnancy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Of these, the most important are prophylaxis against bacterial infections and malaria, prompt treatment of acute bacterial and malarial infection, pain control, and limiting blood transfusion to severe, life-threatening anemia. Observational studies in resource-poor countries such as Benin and Nigeria have demonstrated that morbidity and mortality can be improved using simple measures such as these [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-cell-disease-in-sub-saharan-africa/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p>Our approach is consistent with strategies published by the World Health Organization (WHO), which identified the need for primary prevention of SCD, SCD screening in newborn period, genetic counseling, and accessible comprehensive care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-cell-disease-in-sub-saharan-africa/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The specific objectives of the WHO regional meeting included identifying priority interventions for member states to develop and implement, programs and policies for SCD prevention and control at all levels, and establishing mechanisms for monitoring, evaluation, and research on SCD in African countries.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H432682475\"><span class=\"h1\">IDENTIFYING AFFECTED INDIVIDUALS WITH SCD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The age at diagnosis for SCD is primarily dependent on whether newborn screening has been instituted in the region. Only a few centers in sub-Saharan Africa are able to initiate newborn screening and deliver comprehensive health care at an early age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-cell-disease-in-sub-saharan-africa/abstract/9,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,22</a>]. Most other individuals are diagnosed when they present with a complication of disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4201262117\"><span class=\"h2\">Available diagnostic tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Typically, hemoglobin electrophoresis is used to make the diagnosis in individuals suspected to have SCD based on clinical features and review of the blood smear. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is used in some centers to confirm the diagnosis, depending on availability.</p><p>Point-of-care (POC) diagnostic testing for SCD may be especially useful in areas where it is not possible or convenient to transfer blood samples to a centralized laboratory. POC assays for SCD that are in development are discussed in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methods-for-hemoglobin-analysis-and-hemoglobinopathy-testing#H741992479\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Methods for hemoglobin analysis and hemoglobinopathy testing&quot;, section on 'Point-of-care assays'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12698876\"><span class=\"h2\">Newborn screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnosis of SCD early in life improves survival. Early diagnosis allows for initiation of well-established public health measures for primary prevention including penicillin prophylaxis, routine childhood vaccinations, parental education about prompt medical management for fever, and detection of splenic sequestration. These strategies have been demonstrated to minimize morbidity and improve outcomes and are the basis for newborn screening for SCD being performed in every state in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-cell-disease-in-sub-saharan-africa/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. However, laboratory methods for diagnosis require an infrastructure that is not routinely available in sub-Saharan Africa. Only a few centers in sub-Saharan Africa are able to initiate newborn screening and deliver comprehensive health care at an early age due to the costs associated with such programs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-cell-disease-in-sub-saharan-africa/abstract/9,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,22</a>].</p><p>The importance of newborn screening in reducing mortality has been demonstrated in the following studies:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>United States</strong> &ndash; Reduced mortality was reported in a review that summarized 10 years of experience using newborn screening in the state of California from 1975 to 1985 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-cell-disease-in-sub-saharan-africa/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Of over 80,000 newborns screened, SCD was diagnosed in approximately 0.1 percent and sickle cell trait in 2.6 percent. Mortality in the 81 patients diagnosed with SCD by newborn screening (coupled with education about detecting splenic sequestration and early warning signs of infection) was 1.8 percent over seven years, dramatically lower than the 8 percent mortality in a comparison group of patients diagnosed after three months of age.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Africa</strong> &ndash; In a program in Kenya that identified infants with and without SCD in infancy and then followed them over several years, the survival difference was about the same in those with hemoglobin SS and normal hemoglobin and much higher in children with hemoglobin AS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-cell-disease-in-sub-saharan-africa/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Modeling simulations also suggest that universal screening is especially cost effective in populations with a high frequency of the prevalence of SCD &gt;0.2 to 0.5 per 1000 births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-cell-disease-in-sub-saharan-africa/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The threshold for screening for SCD (0.5 per 1000 births) in many countries in Africa far exceeds the minimum threshold for cost-effectiveness for newborn screening. As an example, in Nigeria the rate of SCD is estimated to be 300 per 1000 births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-cell-disease-in-sub-saharan-africa/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. No federal newborn screening program for SCD has been established for any country in sub-Saharan Africa despite the clear economic and humanitarian basis for such programs; Ghana is close to implementing such a program.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H244521\"><span class=\"h2\">Childhood presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most individuals in sub-Saharan Africa with SCD are not diagnosed by newborn screening and present with symptoms during childhood, at a mean age of two years. Very few are diagnosed earlier (eg, during infancy). The most common presentations for previously undiagnosed SCD include dactylitis at six months to one year and splenic sequestration in the second year of life. Thus, we believe that children presenting with either dactylitis or splenic sequestration should be evaluated for SCD with a complete blood count and hemoglobin analysis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1806322\"><span class=\"h1\">EDUCATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All families in areas where SCD is endemic, especially those in which a family member has SCD, should be aware of common presenting findings of SCD and should understand the importance of being evaluated.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Parents of infants and young children with SCD are educated about the importance of prophylaxis and treatment of infections (see <a href=\"#H12701445\" class=\"local\">'Infections'</a> below):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Infection prevention, which includes immunizations and prophylactic penicillin to prevent bacterial infections, and mosquito netting and malaria prophylaxis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Prompt treatment of infection, including when to bring an ill infant or child to medical attention.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children and adults should be educated about the presenting symptoms of acute chest syndrome, splenic sequestration, and stroke. All patients should understand the use of transcranial Doppler screening (TCD), and those with prior stroke or elevated TCD measurement should understand the potential benefits (and risks) of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyurea</a> therapy. (See <a href=\"#H12700062\" class=\"local\">'Vaso-occlusive events'</a> below and <a href=\"#H243231\" class=\"local\">'Hydroxyurea'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individuals of childbearing age should be educated about risks of having an affected child, and those who become pregnant should understand the importance of appropriate prenatal care, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> supplementation, and adequate hydration. Vaginal delivery should be targeted to 38 weeks gestation if possible. (See <a href=\"#H6881882\" class=\"local\">'Pregnancy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adults should be counseled about possible chronic complications including renal, pulmonary, and orthopedic complications and available interventions to minimize morbidity.

This is especially true for encapsulated organisms because most patients become functionally asplenic early in life (eg, within the first year) due to repeated episodes of sickling-induced splenic infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-cell-disease-in-sub-saharan-africa/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Additional contributing factors include abnormalities of opsonization, antibody production, the alternate complement pathway, leucocyte function defects, and cell-mediated immunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-cell-disease-in-sub-saharan-africa/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1808631\"><span class=\"h3\">Bacterial infections (prophylaxis)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The two major interventions to reduce the incidence of bacterial infections are vaccinations, especially against encapsulated organisms, and penicillin prophylaxis. However, the availability of vaccinations is limited, and routine penicillin prophylaxis is unavailable in the majority of medical centers in sub-Saharan Africa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-cell-disease-in-sub-saharan-africa/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vaccinations</strong> &ndash; We strongly believe that integration of routine childhood immunization against <em>Streptococcus pneumoniae </em>and <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> into the standard of care in sub-Saharan African countries could substantially affect survival of children with SCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-cell-disease-in-sub-saharan-africa/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The administration of childhood vaccinations has been shown to lead to a remarkable decrease in the overall morbidity and mortality associated with infection in children with SCD. This is especially true for invasive pneumococcal disease and <em>H. influenzae</em>. This was demonstrated in a 2016 retrospective study that analyzed a cohort of children with SCD living in Gambia over a five-year period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-cell-disease-in-sub-saharan-africa/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. During the study period, there was a high level of coverage with <em>Haemophilus influenzae</em> type b (Hib) and pneumococcal conjugate vaccinations. The most frequent blood-borne isolate was <em>Salmonella typhimurium</em>, followed by <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> and other enteric Gram-negative pathogens, with no bacteremia by caused by <em>S. pneumoniae</em> or <em>H. influenzae</em>. The low prevalence of <em>S. pneumoniae</em> and <em>H. influenzae</em> indicated that the conjugated vaccines can significantly decrease the rate of bacteremia in children with SCD in sub-Saharan Africa. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-and-prognosis-of-sickle-cell-disease#H3504857\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management and prognosis of sickle cell disease&quot;, section on 'Pneumococcal disease'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-haemophilus-influenzae-type-b-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of Haemophilus influenzae type b infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, the conjugated vaccines against these organisms such as the heptavalent conjugate pneumococcal vaccine (PCV7), which offers protection against invasive pneumococcal infections, and the <em>H. influenzae</em> type b conjugate vaccine, which offers protection against meningitis and septicemia caused by <em>H. influenzae</em>, are only available in some medical centers in sub-Saharan Africa. Even when available, they are unaffordable to the majority of families.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Penicillin</strong> &ndash; Penicillin prophylaxis is highly effective in preventing infection. We recommend monthly intramuscular penicillin prophylaxis rather than daily oral penicillin, based on evidence that adherence to oral penicillin is only 50 to 60 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-cell-disease-in-sub-saharan-africa/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. In contrast, adherence to monthly intramuscular penicillin is approximately 88 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-cell-disease-in-sub-saharan-africa/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Use of intramuscular penicillin also avoids the requirement for refrigeration of oral penicillin suspension, which may be challenging in low-income countries. We continue penicillin prophylaxis until age five years if possible, and some pediatricians may elect to continue for a longer period of time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, routine penicillin prophylaxis is unavailable in the majority of medical centers.</p><p/><p>Additional information about the efficacy of these interventions and typical schedules are presented in detail separately.

The pooled odds ratio of invasive bacterial infection associated with SCD was 19 (95% CI 15-24).</p><p>The most common bacterial organisms in individuals with SCD include <em>S. pneumoniae</em>, <em>H. influenzae</em> type b, and non-typhoid salmonellosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-cell-disease-in-sub-saharan-africa/abstract/31,39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,39,40</a>]. Children under five years of age are at greatest risk for meningitis and septicemia, while all age groups may develop salmonella osteomyelitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-cell-disease-in-sub-saharan-africa/abstract/31,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,33</a>]. The infections seen in Africa are similar to those seen in the United States prior to the institution of routine penicillin prophylaxis and vaccination for encapsulated organisms in the mid-1980s in children with SCD.</p><p>Asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) is more common in individuals with SCD compared with those without. This was demonstrated in a 2017 study from Ghana that found a prevalence of ASB of 17 percent in individuals with SCD, compared with 8 percent in the control group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-cell-disease-in-sub-saharan-africa/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. ASB was found to be higher among females, and the most common organism isolated was coagulase negative <em>Staphylococcus</em> species (4 percent), followed by <em>Escherichia coli</em> (3 percent); the etiology of ASB in the SCD patients was more diverse compared with controls.</p><p>Parents should bring children to medical attention if they have definite or possible indications of infection. Definite indications of infection include fever, tachycardia, and hypotension; along with signs and symptoms suggestive of acute chest syndrome (eg, cough, chest pain), meningitis (eg, headache, nuchal rigidity) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F105545\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef105545 \">table 1</a>), or acute osteomyelitis (eg, bone pain, tenderness, limited range of motion). Very young infants may not complain about pain but may show decreased alertness or appetite and will exhibit tenderness of the affected extremities.</p><p>Laboratory evaluation includes complete blood count, blood and urine cultures, and chest radiography. Lumbar puncture with cerebrospinal fluid analysis and cultures are done for patients with meningeal signs.</p><p>Patients with these findings should be treated promptly with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Common treatment of bacterial infections involves oral or intravenous antibiotics, generally selected based on known efficacy against likely causative organisms.

In high-income countries, hydroxyurea is administered in a maximum tolerated dose strategy that requires intensive monitoring (clinical and laboratory) with frequent and ongoing dose adjustments. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-use-in-sickle-cell-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hydroxyurea use in sickle cell disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyurea</a> often is not used in very young children in Africa, primarily due to concerns about the higher rate of mortality and life-threatening bacterial and malarial infection in affected individuals in Africa and the unknown effect of hydroxyurea therapy (eg, possible increased toxicity) in such a vulnerable group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-cell-disease-in-sub-saharan-africa/abstract/17,33,100-103\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,33,100-103</a>]. Other barriers include the large absolute numbers of individuals with SCD (see <a href=\"#H12698496\" class=\"local\">'Public health burden of SCD'</a> above), the lack of physicians trained in the use of hydroxyurea, the uncertainty regarding the benefits and risks in a resource-poor setting where routine monitoring of blood counts is not available, and the relative high costs of laboratory monitoring visits when compared with the per capita income (both the frequent follow up visits and the laboratory testing).</p><p>Preliminary evidence supporting the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyurea</a> in young children with SCD in Africa was published in a 2017 double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial (the NOHARM [Novel Use of Hydroxyurea in an African Region with Malaria] trial) in which 207 children ages one to four years (average age, two years) in malaria-endemic Uganda were randomly assigned to receive hydroxyurea (20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> daily) or placebo for one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-cell-disease-in-sub-saharan-africa/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>]. Compared with controls, children treated with hydroxyurea had a lower rate of a composite endpoint that included vaso-occlusive pain, dactylitis, acute chest syndrome, splenic sequestration, or blood transfusion (69 versus 45 percent; p = 0.001). Overall mortality was low (&lt;1 event per 100 patient-years), and the use of hydroxyurea was not associated with an increased incidence of malaria or other serious adverse events. The desired effects of hydroxyurea on laboratory parameters were seen (eg, increased total hemoglobin and fetal hemoglobin concentrations) despite dosing that did not approach the maximum tolerated dose strategy used in high-income countries.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Hydroxyurea</a> therapy trials in sub-Saharan Africa (eg, the NOHARM trial and the SPIN trial) are small, but the results are very encouraging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/sickle-cell-disease-in-sub-saharan-africa/abstract/73,104\" class=\"abstract_t\">73,104</a>]. If larger trials also show favorable results, potentially thousands of children with SCD in Africa might benefit from hydroxyurea therapy for preventing morbidity associated with the disease. We suggest hydroxyurea therapy, preferably in a clinical trial setting, for children and adults with indications described above, including frequent vaso-occlusive pain or acute chest syndrome, stroke, or high risk of stroke based on elevated transcranial Doppler (TCD) measurements.

Monitoring is done with a complete blood count (CBC) once every two months, with dose reductions made for significant cytopenias or increased symptoms related to cytopenias (eg, bleeding, increased infections). With this dose, we are not seeing excess toxicity. However, even though this approach is less intensive than that used in high-resource settings, it requires a significant cost to the patient and family related to travel to clinic appointments and the costs of the appointment, medication, and laboratory testing, as well as the availability of more trained clinicians than are present in this part of the world. Thus, this approach can only be used in individuals who are able to bear these costs and at clinics that have the capacity to provide this level of care.</p><p>We will continue to use this dosing and monitoring until further evidence becomes available regarding its risks, costs, and benefits compared with other approaches and in African populations with higher rates of malnutrition, helminth infection, and malaria than were seen in the NOHARM trial.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H243291\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood transfusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We generally reserve blood transfusion for severe, life-threatening anemia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> acute stroke management for patients with SCD in sub-Saharan Africa.</p><p>Blood transfusion is used in the management and prevention of several complications of SCD in children and adults in resource-rich countries.
