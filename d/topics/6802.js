These factors may contribute to difficulty with clearance of airway secretions, ventilation-perfusion mismatching, and eventually global alveolar hypoventilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-sleep-disordered-breathing-in-patients-with-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

It is most often due to obstructive sleep apnea (OSA, a disorder characterized by obstructive apneas and hypopneas) or nocturnal hypoventilation, but central sleep apnea (CSA) can also be seen in patients with myotonic and muscular dystrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-sleep-disordered-breathing-in-patients-with-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>].

However, some patients may have sleep-disordered breathing without symptoms but with suggestive physiologic parameters, eg, severe restriction on pulmonary function tests or unexplained cor pulmonale. Such patients should be evaluated with an arterial blood gas and a sleep study.</p><p>Classic symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing include excessive daytime sleepiness, morning headache, and restless sleep, but insomnia may also be seen. In addition:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some patients with OSA may awaken with choking or shortness of breath</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bed partners of patients with sleep apnea often describe snoring and apnea</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nightmares and enuresis may be symptoms of sleep-disordered breathing</p><p/><p>Even when pulmonary dysfunction is severe, dyspnea is often lacking in patients with neuromuscular disease, probably because exercise capacity is limited by involvement of nonrespiratory muscles.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Specific diseases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The history of a particular disease may also be helpful in some cases.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with polio who had initial involvement of respiratory, trunk, or bulbar muscles, particularly with associated scoliosis or vocal cord paralysis, are more likely than other polio patients to develop abnormalities of gas exchange during sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-sleep-disordered-breathing-in-patients-with-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kyphoscoliosis, even in the absence of neuromuscular disease, is associated with nocturnal hypoventilation and obstructive sleep apnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-sleep-disordered-breathing-in-patients-with-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Although daytime respiratory symptoms are more common when the angle of the thoracic spinal deformity approaches 100 degrees, nocturnal oxygen desaturation is not directly correlated with the degree of scoliosis or with either lung volumes or ventilatory responsiveness. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chest-wall-diseases-and-restrictive-physiology#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chest wall diseases and restrictive physiology&quot;, section on 'Kyphosis and scoliosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with diaphragm weakness may report increased shortness of breath in the supine position or may increase pillows or props to sleep in a more upright position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-sleep-disordered-breathing-in-patients-with-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p>It is desirable to detect nocturnal gas exchange abnormalities before secondary complications result [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-sleep-disordered-breathing-in-patients-with-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. The clinician must therefore be alert to the presence of more subtle symptoms and signs to serve as a guide for the initiation of a sleep evaluation. Routine follow-up visits for patients with neuromuscular disease should incorporate questions about the above signs and symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Physiologic clues to sleep-disordered breathing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Certain physiologic abnormalities may also suggest the presence of sleep-disordered breathing. Patients with daytime hypoxemia and hypercarbia often have further deterioration of gas exchange in sleep. Therefore, patients with even mild abnormalities in daytime blood gases are at risk for significant disruption of nocturnal gas exchange. The most severe nocturnal oxygen desaturation is seen and should be suspected in those patients with cor pulmonale, polycythemia, and daytime systemic hypertension.</p><p>Patients with a maximal inspiratory pressure (PImax) below 50 percent of predicted, or a forced vital capacity (FVC) below 1 to 1.5 L due to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or other neuromuscular diseases, are more likely to have significant nocturnal desaturation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-sleep-disordered-breathing-in-patients-with-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease/abstract/17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20</a>]. Maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) &lt;60 percent may be an earlier marker of impaired respiratory function than FVC &lt;50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-sleep-disordered-breathing-in-patients-with-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION FOR CONTRIBUTING FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with concomitant airflow obstruction tend to have greater gas exchange abnormalities or cor pulmonale associated with their sleep-disordered breathing than do patients with normal airway resistance. As a result, pulmonary function tests should be performed routinely for detection of coexistent airflow obstruction. Other treatable conditions that may contribute to sleep-disordered breathing in patients with restrictive thoracic disease include hypothyroidism and hypophosphatemia.</p><p>Obesity increases the risk of certain forms of sleep-disordered breathing, including obstructive sleep apnea and obesity hypoventilation syndrome.</p><p>Impaired left ventricular function occurs in some patients with obstructive sleep apnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-sleep-disordered-breathing-in-patients-with-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Heart failure, particularly if associated with Cheyne-Stokes respiration, contributes to nocturnal oxygen desaturation and sleep fragmentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-sleep-disordered-breathing-in-patients-with-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. It is therefore important to assess patients with neuromuscular and chest wall disorders for possible concomitant heart failure and, if present, to institute appropriate therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obstructive-sleep-apnea-and-cardiovascular-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obstructive sleep apnea and cardiovascular disease in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The essential part of the assessment is to document abnormalities of oxygenation and sleep. Overnight oximetry, portable multichannel devices, and full polysomnography in the sleep laboratory are all available, but the optimal test for screening patients with neuromuscular and chest wall disorders has not been established.</p><p>The initial evaluation of patients suspected of having sleep-disordered breathing should be performed by clinicians with experience in pulmonary and sleep medicine. However, if initial screening studies are equivocal or negative and if suspicion for sleep-disordered breathing is high, the patients should be referred to a center experienced in the management of these patients, with an accredited sleep laboratory.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Polysomnography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Polysomnography (PSG) is currently considered the &quot;gold standard&quot; for assessing sleep-disordered breathing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F79606\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79606 \">table 1</a>). False negative studies have been reported in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), although it is not clear that this problem applies to patients with non-apneic sleep-disordered breathing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-sleep-disordered-breathing-in-patients-with-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. PSG typically includes six electroencephalogram leads, two electrooculogram leads, a submental electromyogram (EMG) lead, a <span class=\"nowrap\">nasal/oral</span> thermistor to assess air flow, a nasal pressure transducer, thoracic and abdominal monitors to detect excursion of the rib cage and abdomen, an intercostal EMG, a snoring microphone, electrocardiogram (ECG) and leg leads on the anterior tibialis, and pulse oximetry. Monitoring of multiple channels with PSG allows full assessment of possible respiratory as well as nonrespiratory sleep disorders that can coexist in patients with neuromuscular disorders. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-polysomnography-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of polysomnography in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Oximetry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Overnight oximetry alone may be used to screen for oxygen desaturation associated with severe nocturnal hypoventilation in patients with neuromuscular and chest wall disease. Oximetry may underestimate the degree of sleep apnea, however, depending upon the scoring criteria used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-sleep-disordered-breathing-in-patients-with-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease/abstract/24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-27</a>]. In addition, oximetry may have low sensitivity in detecting OSA in patients receiving supplemental oxygen.</p><p>Oximetry is helpful in screening for residual oxygen desaturation in patients who have been started on nocturnal noninvasive ventilation without evaluation in a sleep laboratory. The apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and leak downloaded from the device is helpful in assessing control of OSA, but it does not provide information about oxygen saturation, which can still be low in patients with hypoventilation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=practical-aspects-of-nocturnal-noninvasive-ventilation-in-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Practical aspects of nocturnal noninvasive ventilation in neuromuscular and chest wall disease&quot;, section on 'Monitoring'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Home sleep apnea testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Home sleep apnea testing (HSAT) with four or more channels (eg, heart rate, air flow, chest movement, and oximetry) is likely to detect moderate to severe OSA. However, the severity of sleep apnea may be underestimated, and mild disease may be missed entirely. In addition, sleep disruption or fragmentation, a significant factor in causing daytime sleepiness, is not assessed by oximetry or portable studies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=home-sleep-apnea-testing-for-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Home sleep apnea testing for obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quantifying-sleepiness\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Quantifying sleepiness&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In summary, although oximetry and four-channel studies are adequate to document moderate or severe disease, they should not be used to exclude a diagnosis of sleep-disordered breathing in patients with neuromuscular or chest wall disease. If there is a strong clinical suspicion of sleep-disordered breathing but oximetry or HSAT is negative, full PSG should still be obtained.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">SUPPLEMENTAL TESTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Other tests that are more relevant for research purposes include assessment of respiratory control and intrathoracic pressure changes.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Respiratory control can be evaluated by testing ventilatory responses to hypercarbia and hypoxia, but this is rarely performed in the clinical setting. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=control-of-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Control of ventilation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Esophageal pressure monitoring during sleep is helpful in distinguishing central versus obstructive apneas, because it offers a sensitive way of detecting intrathoracic pressure swings related to respiratory effort. Such monitoring is also particularly useful in detecting the upper airway resistance syndrome, characterized by subtle increases in respiratory effort that are not manifested by changes in air flow but are associated with arousal and sleep fragmentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-sleep-disordered-breathing-in-patients-with-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Therefore, although esophageal balloons for pressure monitoring are not yet considered standard instrumentation during polysomnography, their clinical role is gradually increasing.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>End-tidal PCO<sub>2</sub> (PETCO<sub>2</sub>) monitoring is also included in some polysomnograms, and is believed to be particularly useful in pediatric studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-sleep-disordered-breathing-in-patients-with-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-suspected-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of suspected obstructive sleep apnea in children&quot;</a>.) However, one study found that PETCO<sub>2</sub> measured from exhaled gas in a mask, particularly during use of supplemental oxygen or positive airway pressure delivery systems that incorporate a flow-through to wash out dead space, did not adequately reflect arterial values in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-sleep-disordered-breathing-in-patients-with-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Transcutaneous CO<sub>2</sub> monitors were also found to poorly correlate with arterial CO<sub>2</sub> tensions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-sleep-disordered-breathing-in-patients-with-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. For this reason, noninvasive CO<sub>2</sub> monitoring is not currently considered a routine part of sleep assessment in adults with neuromuscular and chest wall disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-sleep-disordered-breathing-in-patients-with-neuromuscular-and-chest-wall-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. If accurate assessment of CO<sub>2</sub> tension during sleep is desired, invasive blood gas monitoring using an arterial catheter is necessary.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inductance plethysmography may be useful in examining breathing patterns during sleep, particularly if patients develop asynchronous or paradoxical patterns. Detection of abdominal paradox may indicate diaphragm dysfunction.
