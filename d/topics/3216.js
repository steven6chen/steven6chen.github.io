Most women whose cervical cancer is found and treated early do very well. The cervix is the bottom part, or neck, of the uterus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80271\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80271 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H454110525\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of cervical cancer?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cervical cancer might not cause any symptoms at first. When it does cause symptoms, it can cause vaginal bleeding that occurs:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In between menstrual cycles (meaning the bleeding happens when a woman is not having her period)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After sex</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After menopause</p><p/><p>These symptoms can also be caused by conditions that are not cancer. But if you have vaginal bleeding at these times, tell your doctor or nurse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H454110532\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for cervical cancer?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. A Pap test (also called a &quot;Pap smear&quot;) is used to screen women for cervical cancer. For this test, your doctor or nurse looks inside your vagina using a device that looks like a duck beak (called a speculum). He or she will then use a small brush to collect cells from the cervix. A doctor will look at the cells under a microscope to see if they are abnormal. Depending on your age, the doctor will also do a test for a virus called human papillomavirus (HPV). Infection with HPV can cause cervical cancer.</p><p>If the test results are abnormal, the doctor will follow up with a test called a biopsy. During a biopsy, the doctor will remove a tiny piece of abnormal-looking tissue from the cervix. To see the cervix better during a biopsy, the doctor will use a magnifying lens called a &quot;colposcope.&quot;</p><p>Doctors sometimes find cells in the cervix that are not cancer, but are abnormal and have a high chance of turning into cancer. If you have these &quot;precancer&quot; cells, your doctor can treat them in different ways. He or she might remove them to prevent them from turning into cancer. Or he or she might watch them closely over time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H454110539\"><span class=\"h1\">What is cervical cancer staging?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cancer staging is a way in which doctors find out how far a cancer has spread.</p><p>The right treatment for you will depend a lot on the stage of your cancer, your age, and other health problems. Your treatment will also depend on whether you might want to get pregnant in the future.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H454110546\"><span class=\"h1\">How is cervical cancer treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cervical cancer can be treated in different ways. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Surgery</strong> &ndash; Some cases of cervical cancer are treated with surgery to remove the cancer. Different types of surgery can involve:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Removing the cervix, uterus, and upper part of the vagina &ndash; This is called a &quot;radical hysterectomy&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F78941\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78941 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Removing all or part of the cervix but leaving the uterus in place &ndash; This type of surgery is done only in special situations.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Radiation therapy</strong> &ndash; Radiation kills cancer cells.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Chemotherapy</strong> &ndash; Chemotherapy is the medical term for medicines that kill cancer cells or stop them from growing. Women with cervical cancer usually receive chemotherapy at the same time as radiation therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H454110553\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to get pregnant one day?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you want to have a baby one day, talk with your doctor before having treatment. Some women can still get pregnant after being treated for cervical cancer. But, a woman cannot get pregnant after some types of treatment, such as a hysterectomy, radiation therapy, or some types of chemotherapy.</p><p>Women are often able to get pregnant after other types of treatment. But they usually need to wait 6 to 12 months before they start trying to get pregnant, because their body needs time to heal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H454110560\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens after treatment?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After treatment, you will be checked every so often to see if the cancer comes back. Follow-up tests can include exams, Pap tests, and X-rays.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H454110567\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens if the cancer comes back or spreads?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the cancer comes back or spreads, you might have more surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H454110574\"><span class=\"h1\">What else should I do?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important to follow all your doctor's instructions about visits and tests. It's also important to talk to your doctor about any side effects or problems you have during treatment.</p><p>Getting treated for cervical cancer involves making many choices, such as which type of surgery to have.</p><p>Always let your doctors and nurses know how you feel about a treatment. Any time you are offered a treatment, ask:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the benefits of this treatment? Is it likely to help me live longer? Will it reduce or prevent symptoms?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the downsides to this treatment?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are there other options besides this treatment?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What happens if I do not have this treatment?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H454110581\"><span class=\"h1\">Can cervical cancer be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In many cases, yes. Almost all cervical cancer is caused by a virus called HPV (human papillomavirus) that is spread through skin-to-skin contact and sex. Vaccines that prevent people from getting infected with HPV are now available. Ask your doctor if and when you should get an HPV vaccine. This vaccine is available for men and women, and works best if a person receives it before he or she starts having sex. Also, treating precancer cells can keep them from turning into cervical cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H454110588\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-screening-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cancer screening (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=what-are-clinical-trials-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: What are clinical trials?
