The management of these patients is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-posterior-urethral-valves\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of posterior urethral valves&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of posterior urethral valves (PUV) appears to be due to an obstructing persistent urogenital membrane (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F87629\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87629 \">figure 1</a>). Although the exact mechanism resulting in this obstruction is not completely understood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-posterior-urethral-valves/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], it appears that the normal embryologic development of the male urethra between weeks 9 and 14 of gestation is disrupted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Normal male urethral embryology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Between weeks four and six of gestation, the cloaca is divided into the anorectal canal and the urogenital sinus. Over the following weeks of gestation, the urogenital sinus is divided by the entrance of the mesonephric duct into the cephalad vesicourethral canal, giving rise to the bladder and pelvic urethra. The caudal portion of the urogenital sinus (genital tubercle) forms the phallic urethra. As the genital tubercle elongates in the male fetus, the urethral groove and folds are created. As the penile urethra grows, it moves towards the urethral plate of the glans penis. Complete fusion of the entire urethra occurs at about 14 weeks gestation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">PUV embryology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several disruptions of the male embryologic urethral development have been proposed as the mechanism resulting in PUV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-posterior-urethral-valves/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. These are based upon published anatomical descriptions in the literature and include the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-posterior-urethral-valves/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persistence of the urogenital membrane with abnormal canalization of the urethra.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Overgrowth of urethrovaginal folds.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormal integration of the Wolffian duct into the posterior urethra. Normally, the insertion of the Wolffian duct occurs in the cloaca before its division into the urogenital sinuses and anorectal canal. The Wolffian duct then involutes into thin mucosal folds (plicae colliculi) that run distal and lateral to the verumontanum in the midprostatic urethra. In this proposed mechanism, PUV are thought to arise from abnormal anterior insertion of the Wolffian duct into the cloaca that results in a thicker, more prominent, fused, and obstructing fold.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The traditional classification for posterior urethral valves (PUV) was developed by Young in 1919 based upon autopsies of a case series of PUV as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-posterior-urethral-valves/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type 1 valve &minus; The most common form is composed of a ridge from the verumontanum that divides into two leaflets, which attaches to the anterior urethra (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F87629\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87629 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type 2 valve &minus; This type of valve is no longer considered a form of PUV but is believed to be a dissection artifact. It was reported to extend from the verumontanum towards the internal sphincter and bladder neck.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type 3 valve &minus; This form is a diaphragm distal to the verumontanum with a central perforation, which may be a result of an attempt to place an urethral catheter.</p><p/><p>In the 1990s, this classification was challenged based upon anatomic evaluation of cases using radiologic studies and direct observation by cystoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-posterior-urethral-valves/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. This reassessment suggested that PUV are the result of a single pathologic condition of an oblique membrane associated with the verumontanum, which was defined as congenital obstructive posterior urethral membrane (COPUM). In this reevaluation, COPUM was differentiated from Cobb's collar, which is defined as a congenital urethral stricture caused by a transverse membrane in the posterior urethra, and which has no relationship with the verumontanum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-posterior-urethral-valves/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. This new classification system has not yet been widely adopted into clinical practice.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the developed world, about half of posterior urethral valve (PUV) cases are identified by prenatal ultrasonography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-posterior-urethral-valves/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Patients who are diagnosed postnatally usually present either as a newborn or young infant with urinary tract symptoms, abdominal distension, or associated clinical manifestations, such as respiratory distress due to lung hypoplasia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Prenatal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prenatal ultrasonographic findings of bilateral hydronephrosis, dilated bladder, and a dilated posterior urethra (keyhole sign) in a male fetus is suggestive of PUV (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F73308\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef73308 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-posterior-urethral-valves/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In addition, the bladder wall, which normally does not exceed 3 mm, may be thickened. Sonographic visualization of the PUV is not possible because of their small size.</p><p>In severe cases of obstruction, oligohydramnios (low volume of amniotic fluid) may also be present. Increased pressure in the urinary tract proximal to the obstruction may lead to rupture of the fornix or calyx in the kidney with development of urinary ascites or a perinephric urinoma. A large bladder diverticula or patent urachus may also develop. Other prenatal renal ultrasound findings may include increased renal echogenicity and cortical cysts suggestive of renal dysplasia, which is often associated with PUV.</p><p>The risk of perinatal mortality and postnatal chronic kidney disease are increased if prenatal ultrasound findings suggestive of PUV are noted before 24 weeks gestation, or if there is severe bilateral hydronephrosis with oligohydramnios or findings consistent with renal dysplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-posterior-urethral-valves/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. When oligohydramnios is present in the second trimester, perinatal mortality can be as high as 90 to 95 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-posterior-urethral-valves/abstract/11,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,14</a>].

In one retrospective report of 18 fetuses, two-thirds of the antenatal diagnoses corresponded to the postnatal diagnoses. Six cases of PUV were diagnosed prenatally; however, only two had PUV confirmed postnatally. As a result, fetal intervention based upon ultrasonographic findings must be considered cautiously.

Lung hypoplasia develops because of oligohydramnios, as normal amniotic fluid levels are required for the canalicular phase of lung development, which occurs between 16 and 28 weeks gestation. One cause of oligohydramnios is decreased fetal urinary excretion in fetuses with severe bladder outlet obstruction. The outcome for neonates with lung hypoplasia due to severe PUV is poor.

In addition, after bladder decompression, many neonates will have an elevated serum creatinine indicating impaired renal function due to renal dysplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-posterior-urethral-valves/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Higher voiding pressures, which infants may have after valve ablation, are not necessarily associated with impaired renal function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-posterior-urethral-valves/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>The relationship between the development of renal dysplasia and PUV is unknown.

Support for this theory is based upon the observation of several conditions that result in a &quot;pop off&quot; mechanism with lowering of the intravesical pressure, which results in protection of the developing kidney and preservation of renal function. These conditions include large bladder diverticula, urinary ascites due to forniceal or calyceal extravasation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75302\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef75302 \">image 2</a>), perirenal urinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-posterior-urethral-valves/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], and massive unilateral reflux with no renal function on the affected side but normal development of the contralateral side (Vesicoureteral reflux Unilateral Renal Dysplasia [VURD]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-posterior-urethral-valves/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p>Recurrent infection resulting in renal scarring has been thought to be an important risk factor for CKD.

VUR is classified as secondary and is due to the increased intravesical pressure from bladder outlet obstruction, which results in failure of the normal closure of the ureterovesical junction during voiding (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75302\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef75302 \">image 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F62496\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef62496 \">image 3</a>).

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-chronic-kidney-disease-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of chronic kidney disease in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of posterior urethral valves (PUV) includes other causes of obstructive uropathy such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Agenesis or <span class=\"nowrap\">stricture/stenosis</span> of the urethra</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although more commonly observed in girls, the megalourethra, megacystis, microcolon syndrome</p><p/><p>These causes are distinguished from PUV by voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) and cystoscopy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Posterior urethral valves (PUV) are obstructing membranous folds within the lumen of the posterior urethra that are caused by a still yet to be determined disruption in the normal embryologic development of the male urethra (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F87629\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87629 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the developed world, the vast majority of PUV cases are identified by prenatal ultrasonography. Prenatal ultrasonographic findings of bilateral hydronephrosis and a dilated bladder with a dilated posterior urethra (ie, keyhole sign) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F73308\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef73308 \">image 1</a>) in a male fetus is suggestive of PUV. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Prenatal'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who are diagnosed postnatally usually present either as a newborn with urinary tract symptoms, abdominal distension, or respiratory distress due to lung hypoplasia, or as a young infant with failure to thrive, urosepsis, poor urinary stream, or straining while voiding. Older boys may present with urinary tract infections, day time and nocturnal incontinence (enuresis), and symptoms of voiding dysfunction. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Postnatal'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical manifestations of the PUV include an increased risk of chronic kidney disease and bladder dysfunction. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Renal and urologic manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presumptive diagnosis of PUV is made by voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) that demonstrates the hallmark findings of a dilated and elongated posterior urethra with a thin linear defect during the voiding phase (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F62496\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef62496 \">image 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59938\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef59938 \">image 4</a>).
