It is classified based upon the mechanism: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary adrenal insufficiency, also known as Addison's disease, results from disease intrinsic to the adrenal cortex (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F81494\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81494 \">table 1</a>). These patients may present with glucocorticoid deficiency, with or without deficiencies of mineralocorticoids and adrenal androgens.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Central adrenal insufficiency is caused by impaired production of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). It can be caused by either pituitary disease that impairs release of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH; secondary adrenal insufficiency (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F56675\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56675 \">table 2A</a>)); or by interference with corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) release from the hypothalamus (tertiary adrenal insufficiency (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F54164\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54164 \">table 2B</a>)). These patients have only glucocorticoid deficiency and not mineralocorticoid deficiency. In addition, they may have other pituitary hormone deficiencies, depending on the underlying central nervous system disease. &#160;</p><p/><p>Clinical findings of children with adrenal insufficiency include fatigue and gastrointestinal complaints of nausea and vomiting. Additional symptoms can be categorized based upon the specific hormones affected (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F66355\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66355 \">table 3</a>). Signs of mineralocorticoid deficiency (hypotension, dehydration, and electrolyte abnormalities) are often observed in patients with primary adrenal insufficiency.</p><p>The most common cause of adrenal insufficiency in infants is classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia, which is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-classic-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasia-due-to-21-hydroxylase-deficiency-in-infants-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency in infants and children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The treatment of adrenal insufficiency will be discussed in this topic review.

Glucocorticoid dosing must be increased during times of stress. Patients with central adrenal insufficiency or with resistance to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) should require only glucocorticoid replacement. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ADRENAL HORMONE REPLACEMENT THERAPY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We prefer to use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">hydrocortisone</a> for glucocorticoid replacement for most infants and children because of its short duration of action and lower potency, allowing for fine titration to the optimal dose. Starting doses for glucocorticoid therapy are usually based on the estimates of normal cortisol secretion rates, which vary based on the age of the subjects: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For children and older infants, cortisol secretion rates were estimated at approximately 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day</span>. This is based on a series of studies performed in the 1990s, which showed cortisol production rates of about 4 to 7 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day</span> in 8- to 17-year-old children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-children/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>], and about 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day</span> in young adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For newborn infants, cortisol secretion rates are approximately 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day</span>. This was based upon studies from the 1960s that used older techniques that were eventually replaced by more sensitive assay methods. These earlier studies reported that cortisol secretion at birth was 1.5 times higher than in adults, and by 3 weeks of age had decreased to 1.2 times that in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. &#160; &#160; </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H944510266\"><span class=\"h3\">Hydrocortisone dosing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In practice, we generally aim for a starting dose of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">hydrocortisone</a> (cortisol) of 7 to 12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53011\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53011 \">table 4</a>). This is somewhat higher than the normal daily cortisol secretion rate, because of the short half-life of hydrocortisone given orally and its partial destruction by gastric acidity. The body surface area is calculated from the child's height and weight using a nomogram or calculator (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-body-surface-area-mosteller-square-root-method\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The total daily oral hydrocortisone dose is usually divided into three doses and administered every eight hours. The dose for long-term replacement must be adjusted to the requirement of individual subjects, as indicated by biochemical and physiologic response to treatment including growth rate. </p><p>The glucocorticoid dosing requirement varies with the type of adrenal insufficiency: &#160; &#160;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Congenital adrenal hyperplasia</strong> &ndash; For patients with classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency, the doses of glucocorticoid required to suppress the ACTH-stimulated excessive adrenal androgens are usually higher than those required to adequately treat other causes of adrenal insufficiency; doses required in neonates with CAH are about twofold higher than in older children. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-classic-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasia-due-to-21-hydroxylase-deficiency-in-infants-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency in infants and children&quot;</a>.) &#160; </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other causes of primary adrenal insufficiency</strong> &ndash; For children with primary adrenal insufficiency that is <strong>not</strong> due to congenital adrenal hyperplasia, the starting oral dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">hydrocortisone</a> is in the range of 7 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Infants usually require somewhat higher doses for adequate replacement. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For these patients, the close follow-up of somatic growth (weight, bone age, and height and weight velocities) provides the most important guidelines for dose adjustment. In general, inadequate weight gain or recurrent symptoms of glucocorticoid deficiency (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F66355\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66355 \">table 3</a>) suggest the need for increased dose of glucocorticoid or mineralocorticoid. The need for higher doses of cortisol replacement would be supported by the presence of increasing hyperpigmentation, and a marked elevation of the plasma ACTH level (more than 10 times the upper limit of normal). Signs and symptoms suggesting the need for adjustment of mineralocorticoid replacement are discussed below.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Excessive weight gain with decreased height velocity, facial plethora, or other symptoms or signs of Cushing syndrome indicate excessive glucocorticoid replacement. In patients with adequate replacement therapy based on clinical parameters and body size, measurements of plasma ACTH are typically above the normal range and are highly variable, and we do not find them helpful for routine monitoring.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Central adrenal insufficiency</strong> &ndash; Central (secondary or tertiary) adrenal insufficiency, which is characterized by ACTH deficiency, is treated with glucocorticoid at physiologic replacement doses in the lower end of the expected dose range, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">hydrocortisone</a> 7 to 9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day</span>. The dose must be titrated carefully to prevent overtreatment, which seems to occur at lower doses in children with ACTH deficiency than in those with primary adrenal failure. Mineralocorticoid treatment is generally unnecessary, as these patients have a normal renin-angiotensin-aldosterone axis and hence normal mineralocorticoid secretion. The growth rates in weight and height, and general clinical well-being are the most useful parameters to follow for dose adjustments.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2757612810\"><span class=\"h3\">Alternative forms of glucocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Instead of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">hydrocortisone</a>, one also can use oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">prednisolone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">prednisone</a>. These synthetic glucocorticoids have a longer half-life than hydrocortisone, which makes it possible to administer doses every 12 hours. They are also about four to five times more potent than hydrocortisone in terms of ACTH suppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], and may be 5 to 15 times more potent in terms of growth suppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. For <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">dexamethasone</a>, the ACTH suppressive effect may be 35 to 50 times that of hydrocortisone, but the growth suppressive effect may be 75 to 95 times higher. Other more potent synthetic glucocorticoid preparations, such as dexamethasone, are not often used for replacement therapy except in adults. Their great potency makes it difficult to titrate the appropriate dose for children. However, with appropriate compounding of dilute concentrations in oral suspension, dexamethasone has been used successfully without causing growth suppression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Prednisolone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">prednisone</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">dexamethasone</a> lack significant mineralocorticoid activity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F64138\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64138 \">table 5</a>). If these glucocorticoids are chosen for treatment of patients with primary adrenal insufficiency, the treatment regimen also must include the mineralocorticoid <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludrocortisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fludrocortisone</a> (9-alpha-fluorocortisol), and the dose of fludrocortisone may need to be higher than was needed if glucocorticoid treatment was changed from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">hydrocortisone</a>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-classic-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasia-due-to-21-hydroxylase-deficiency-in-infants-and-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency in infants and children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Mineralocorticoids'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Mineralocorticoids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with primary adrenal failure require mineralocorticoid replacement with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludrocortisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fludrocortisone</a>. The usual daily dose is 0.1 mg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]; however, higher doses are occasionally needed in infants, or in patients treated with glucocorticoids that have little or no mineralocorticoid activity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F64138\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64138 \">table 5</a>). The mineralocorticoid dose is not adjusted by age or surface area because the aldosterone secretion rate is nearly constant throughout the lifespan. However, infants younger than 1 year may require sodium chloride supplementation at a dose of approximately 1 gram (17 mEq) daily, due to relatively low dietary sodium intake in formula and breast milk and a relative renal resistance to mineralocorticoids in this age group. </p><p>Symptoms of inadequate mineralocorticoid replacement include salt-craving and poor weight gain; signs include dehydration, hyponatremia with hyperkalemia and marked elevation of plasma renin activity (PRA). Routine measurement of PRA may be difficult to interpret when monitoring adequacy of treatment because its levels tend to be variable, based on posture and sodium intake, and are often above the normal range even in patients who are receiving adequate replacement therapy. However, measurement of PRA may be useful in monitoring compliance with therapy, or in response to an unexplained change in clinical status; PRA in the upper end of the reference range is a marker for a correct mineralocorticoid dose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>Children with central adrenal insufficiency do not have mineralocorticoid deficiency because ACTH is not the physiological regulator of aldosterone release. Treatment with mineralocorticoids is not necessary. However, these patients may have deficiencies of other pituitary hormones that may require replacement.

In this setting, the primary goal of treatment is to avoid the serious consequence of adrenal crisis. Clinical experience suggests that the treatment regimens described below provide ample glucocorticoid coverage for acute stress, but ongoing monitoring and treatment are required if the physiological stress is prolonged.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Illness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Minor infection <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> low-grade fever (sore throat, rhinorrhea, fever up to 38&ordm;C) may not require a change in dose. During conditions of moderate stress (eg, severe upper respiratory infections), the dose should be double the usual glucocorticoid replacement dose. In major stress (eg, temperature above 38&ordm;C <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vomiting), the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">hydrocortisone</a> dose should be increased to three to four times the normal replacement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. For patients receiving glucocorticoid therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">dexamethasone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">prednisone</a>, it is important to note that increasing the dose of these medications during acute illness may not achieve the blood levels of cortisol that are needed for stress sufficiently quickly. Thus, it is preferable to use oral hydrocortisone for stress dosing, to provide the advantages of rapid increases in serum cortisol levels as well as mineralocorticoid effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p>Under stress conditions, infants and children frequently are unable to tolerate oral therapy. In such cases, the parents are advised to administer an intramuscular (IM) injection of approximately 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">hydrocortisone</a> sodium succinate (SoluCortef), using the body surface area calculated from the child's height and weight using a nomogram or calculator (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-body-surface-area-mosteller-square-root-method\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>).

Electrolyte and fluid therapy must be instituted as soon as possible. A rapid overview guiding the recognition and treatment of adrenal crisis is shown in the accompanying table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61357\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61357 \">table 6</a>).</p><p>The predominant manifestations of adrenal crisis are hypotension and shock, usually with hyponatremia and hyperkalemia.

It is precipitated by mineralocorticoid deficiency. Thus, adrenal crisis can occur in patients who are receiving physiologic or even pharmacologic doses of synthetic glucocorticoid if their mineralocorticoid requirements are not met. </p><p>Adrenal crisis is most likely to occur in primary adrenal insufficiency because of the associated mineralocorticoid deficiency and salt loss. However, patients with central adrenal insufficiency also may present in crisis with hypotension and shock, and require stress steroid coverage to prevent this. Such patients do not have the typical electrolyte disturbances and severe dehydration that is seen when patients with primary adrenal insufficiency have adrenal crisis. &#160; &#160;</p><p>In infants presenting with adrenal crisis, the cause may be classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia; the evaluation and management are discussed separately.

These patients have glucocorticoid deficiency, with or without deficiencies of mineralocorticoids and adrenal androgens. Central adrenal insufficiency is caused by impaired production of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) in the brain (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F56675%7EPEDS%2F54164\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56675 graphicRef54164 \">table 2A-B</a>). Patients with central adrenal insufficiency typically have only glucocorticoid deficiency. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients with adrenal insufficiency require glucocorticoid replacement. The total daily oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">hydrocortisone</a> dose is divided into three doses and administered every eight hours. The optimal dose depends on the type of adrenal insufficiency. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Adrenal hormone replacement therapy'</a> above.) &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with primary adrenal insufficiency <strong>other</strong> than congenital adrenal hyperplasia, initial replacement doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">hydrocortisone</a> are approximately 7 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup>/day</span> when given orally. Doses for infants are on the higher end of this range, and doses for patients with central adrenal insufficiency are on the lower end of this range. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Infants with congenital adrenal hyperplasia typically require substantially higher initial replacement doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">hydrocortisone</a>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-classic-congenital-adrenal-hyperplasia-due-to-21-hydroxylase-deficiency-in-infants-and-children#H29278193\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of classic congenital adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency in infants and children&quot;, section on 'Medications and dosing'</a>.) &#160; &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The dose should then be titrated to the individual patient's needs depending on the clinical response and growth.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For infants and children with primary adrenal insufficiency we suggest treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">hydrocortisone</a> rather than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">prednisone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">prednisolone</a>&nbsp;(<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). The relatively low potency and short duration of action of hydrocortisone allows for fine titration of the dose. Longer-acting synthetic glucocorticoids such as prednisone and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">dexamethasone</a> may be used in older adolescents and adults, but lack mineralocorticoid effects. Therefore, patients with primary adrenal insufficiency require <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludrocortisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">fludrocortisone</a> for adequate mineralocorticoid replacement. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoids'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with primary adrenal insufficiency also require mineralocorticoid replacement. The dose of mineralocorticoid depends on the type of glucocorticoid given concurrently, and is further adjusted based on the clinical response. Doses of mineralocorticoid may need to be adjusted to optimize growth, prevent salt-craving, and maintain normal electrolytes, especially in infants. In most children and adolescents, the mineralocorticoid dose is close to 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> and does not need frequent adjustment. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Mineralocorticoids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glucocorticoid doses must be increased during physiologic stress using doses ranging from two to four times the replacement dose, depending on the stressor. Children who are unable to tolerate oral therapy should be given an intramuscular injection of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">hydrocortisone</a> sodium succinate (SoluCortef) to meet their urgent need, but should then seek medical attention. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Stress conditions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients receiving glucocorticoid therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">dexamethasone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">prednisone</a>, it is important to note that increasing the dose of these medications during acute illness may not achieve the blood levels of cortisol that are needed for stress sufficiently quickly. Thus, it may be preferable to use oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">hydrocortisone</a> for stress dosing, to provide the advantages of rapid increases in serum cortisol levels as well as mineralocorticoid effect. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>General anesthesia sharply increases glucocorticoid requirements, in addition to the stress of surgery itself. Typical regimens for corticosteroid replacement during surgery include an intravenous (IV) bolus at the beginning of surgery, followed by variable regimens postoperatively depending on the length of the surgery and the degree of surgical stress. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Surgical procedures'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adrenal crisis is generally precipitated by mineralocorticoid deficiency in patients with primary adrenal insufficiency. The predominant clinical finding is hypotension or shock, often with hyponatremia and hyperkalemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F78490\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78490 \">table 7</a>). Patients with central adrenal insufficiency may present in crisis with hypotension and shock, but do not have significant electrolyte imbalance or dehydration. All patients with suspected adrenal crisis should be urgently treated with fluid boluses and a glucocorticoid, as described in the rapid overview (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61357\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61357 \">table 6</a>).
