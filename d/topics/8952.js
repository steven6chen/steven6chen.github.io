DLE most commonly occurs on the head and is characterized by well-defined inflammatory plaques that evolve into atrophic, disfiguring scars (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F64844%7EDERM%2F75833\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64844 graphicRef75833 \">picture 1A-B</a>). SCLE typically presents with erythematous, scaly papules or annular plaques on the neck, upper trunk, and arms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F66580%7EDERM%2F55903\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66580 graphicRef55903 \">picture 2A-B</a>).</p><p>Concern over the appearance of skin lesions leads most patients with DLE or SCLE to desire treatment, and the majority will respond to photoprotection combined with topical antiinflammatory agents or systemic antimalarial drugs. In particular, early treatment of DLE is essential to minimize scarring.</p><p>The initial approach to the treatment of patients with DLE or SCLE will be discussed here. The clinical manifestations of DLE and SCLE and the management of patients with refractory disease are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-cutaneous-lupus-erythematosus#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of cutaneous lupus erythematosus&quot;, section on 'Discoid lupus erythematosus'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-cutaneous-lupus-erythematosus#H127905713\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of cutaneous lupus erythematosus&quot;, section on 'Subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-refractory-discoid-lupus-and-subacute-cutaneous-lupus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of refractory discoid lupus and subacute cutaneous lupus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1495831\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW OF TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although most individuals with DLE or SCLE require pharmacologic therapy to treat active skin lesions, the elimination of exacerbating factors is an important component of long-term management. Strict photoprotection should be recommended, and photosensitizing medications should be discontinued if feasible. The possibility of drug-induced disease also needs to be considered in patients who present with SCLE, and should prompt discontinuation of any potential offending agents. (See <a href=\"#H5875549\" class=\"local\">'Nonpharmacologic measures'</a> below.)</p><p>For most patients with DLE or SCLE, topical corticosteroids are an appropriate first-line therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F78893\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef78893 \">algorithm 1</a>). Topical calcineurin inhibitors, which lack the atrophogenic effects of corticosteroids, have also been shown to be effective for the treatment of cutaneous lupus. However, topical calcineurin inhibitors are more expensive than many topical corticosteroids, and may have a slower onset of action. Intralesional corticosteroid injections can be used to treat patients with focal lesions that do not respond to topical treatment. (See <a href=\"#H4537249\" class=\"local\">'Local therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>When DLE and SCLE are refractory to local therapy or local treatment is impractical due to the presence of extensive disease, systemic antimalarial therapy is often effective. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxychloroquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Hydroxychloroquine</a> is the most common agent used in the treatment of cutaneous lupus. Other systemic agents may also be tried if antimalarial therapy fails. (See <a href=\"#H4537279\" class=\"local\">'Systemic therapy'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-refractory-discoid-lupus-and-subacute-cutaneous-lupus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of refractory discoid lupus and subacute cutaneous lupus&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5875549\"><span class=\"h1\">NONPHARMACOLOGIC MEASURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4537221\"><span class=\"h2\">Photoprotection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with DLE or SCLE should engage in sun-protective measures on a daily basis, including the use of broad spectrum sunscreens and sun protective clothing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-discoid-lupus-and-subacute-cutaneous-lupus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Exposure to ultraviolet light, and in rare cases visible light, can be an exacerbating factor for cutaneous lupus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-discoid-lupus-and-subacute-cutaneous-lupus/abstract/1-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-8</a>]. In experimental settings, exposure to ultraviolet light has been shown to induce skin lesions in approximately 70 to 100 percent of patients with SCLE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-discoid-lupus-and-subacute-cutaneous-lupus/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>] and approximately 64 percent of patients with DLE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-discoid-lupus-and-subacute-cutaneous-lupus/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The latency period between sun exposure and the development of photo-induced skin lesions can last from several days to three weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-discoid-lupus-and-subacute-cutaneous-lupus/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Thus, some patients may fail to associate exacerbations of skin lesions with photosensitivity. </p><p>Few studies have addressed the efficacy of sunscreen in preventing the development of skin lesions. The following data support sunscreen use in this population:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a company-sponsored, randomized, intraindividual trial of 25 patients with cutaneous lupus erythematosus (17 with lupus erythematosus tumidus, five with DLE, and three with SCLE), experimental UVA or UVB irradiation failed to induce skin lesions in all sites treated with a sun protective factor (SPF) 60 sunscreen containing ethylhexyl methoxycinnamate, titanium dioxide, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zinc-oxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zinc oxide</a>, and methylene bis-benzotriazolyl tetramethylbutylphenol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-discoid-lupus-and-subacute-cutaneous-lupus/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In contrast, skin lesions consistent with cutaneous lupus erythematosus developed in untreated or vehicle-treated sites in 16 (64 percent) and 14 patients (56 percent), respectively. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-cutaneous-photosensitivity-photobiology-patient-evaluation-and-photoprotection#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of cutaneous photosensitivity: Photobiology, patient evaluation, and photoprotection&quot;, section on 'Photoprotection'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An intraindividual study of 11 patients with DLE or SCLE compared the ability of three different broad spectrum sunscreens to protect against the development of skin lesions after exposure to UVA and UVB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-discoid-lupus-and-subacute-cutaneous-lupus/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. All three sunscreens had protective effects. The most protective sunscreen prevented the development of skin lesions in all patients and had an SPF of 60. This sunscreen contained octocrylene, avobenzone, ecamsule, drometrizole trisiloxane, and titanium dioxide. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective study found that an SPF 30 broad spectrum sunscreen containing avobenzone, octocrylene, ethylhexyl triazone, drometrizole trisiloxane, and titanium dioxide was highly effective in preventing new lesions following irradiation with UVA and UVB in 49 out of 51 patients with cutaneous lupus (primarily DLE or lupus tumidus) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-discoid-lupus-and-subacute-cutaneous-lupus/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An eight-week open label study, in which subjects with DLE and SCLE were instructed to apply a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF greater than 15 that contained avobenzone and padimate O, demonstrated that daily use of this sunscreen led to a decrease in disease severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-discoid-lupus-and-subacute-cutaneous-lupus/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p>Given the lack of large scale comparative trials addressing the efficacy of different sunscreens in the management of cutaneous lupus, patients generally should be advised to use broad spectrum, water-resistant sunscreens with an SPF of at least 30. However, typical patient use of sunscreen often provides insufficient protection for the photosensitive patient. The importance of other sun protective behaviors including the use of sun protective clothing, broad-brimmed hats, and sun avoidance (particularly during peak midday hours) must be emphasized. Specific products to reduce environmental UV exposure, such as UV blocking films for car windows, are also available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-discoid-lupus-and-subacute-cutaneous-lupus/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-cutaneous-photosensitivity-photobiology-patient-evaluation-and-photoprotection#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of cutaneous photosensitivity: Photobiology, patient evaluation, and photoprotection&quot;, section on 'Photoprotection'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4537235\"><span class=\"h2\">Avoidance of exacerbating drugs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Drug-induced SCLE presents with cutaneous and serologic findings similar to idiopathic disease. Medications that are associated with drug-induced SCLE should be discontinued or avoided when possible in patients with SCLE. A list of drugs associated with the development of SCLE is provided (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62265\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62265 \">table 1</a>). Withdrawal of the culprit agent often leads to resolution of the skin disease. However, many patients have persistently detectable autoantibodies <span class=\"nowrap\">(SSA/Ro</span> antibodies or <span class=\"nowrap\">SSB/La</span> antibodies), and a minority have persistent skin disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-discoid-lupus-and-subacute-cutaneous-lupus/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p>In addition, medications that are known to cause photosensitivity may exacerbate symptoms in patients with idiopathic DLE or SCLE and should be avoided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-discoid-lupus-and-subacute-cutaneous-lupus/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=photosensitivity-disorders-photodermatoses-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Photosensitivity disorders (photodermatoses): Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment&quot;, section on 'Photosensitivity due to exogenous agents'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4537242\"><span class=\"h2\">Smoking cessation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The impact of smoking cessation on patients with cutaneous lupus has not been studied. However, smoking has been associated with the development of cutaneous lupus and may contribute to the development of more severe disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-discoid-lupus-and-subacute-cutaneous-lupus/abstract/21-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-25</a>]. In a case control study of 108 patients with cutaneous lupus (majority with DLE or SCLE), patients with cutaneous lupus were more likely to be smokers than matched controls (OR 2.77, 95% CI 1.63-4.76) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-discoid-lupus-and-subacute-cutaneous-lupus/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Smoking preceded the onset of symptoms in 91 percent of the affected smokers. Additional studies are necessary to determine the effect of smoking cessation on disease activity. </p><p>There is also uncertainty regarding the impact of smoking on the efficacy of antimalarial therapy for discoid lupus and subacute cutaneous lupus. A meta-analysis of observational studies that assessed the impact of smoking on the response of cutaneous lupus to antimalarial drugs found a twofold reduction in the likelihood of clinical improvement among smokers compared with nonsmokers (pooled odds ratio 0.53, 95% CI 0.29-0.98) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-discoid-lupus-and-subacute-cutaneous-lupus/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. This meta-analysis, however, did not limit the analysis to studies including only patients with discoid and subacute cutaneous lupus. </p><p>Moreover, no studies have identified smoking as an independent risk factor for antimalarial failure in patients with cutaneous lupus. One large retrospective cohort study failed to demonstrate reduced antimalarial efficacy among smokers with DLE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-discoid-lupus-and-subacute-cutaneous-lupus/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], and a prospective cohort study has shown increased responsiveness of cutaneous lupus to antimalarial therapy among smokers with mild disease as compared with nonsmokers with mild disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-discoid-lupus-and-subacute-cutaneous-lupus/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. </p><p>Additional research will be useful for clarifying the impact of smoking on antimalarial therapy. It is possible that factors such as increased disease severity among subjects who smoke and nonadherence to antimalarial therapy in smokers may be responsible for antimalarial failure in some patients who smoke. If smoking has a negative effect on antimalarial therapy, nicotine interference with uptake of drug into cell lysosomes or the acceleration of the metabolic clearance of these medications is a potential mechanism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-discoid-lupus-and-subacute-cutaneous-lupus/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. It is unclear whether the use of nicotine substitutes (eg, chewing gums, patches, or inhalers) could have a similar effect, so when possible, smoking cessation without the use of these aids is preferable.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5875776\"><span class=\"h2\">Vitamin D</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vitamin D deficiency may have deleterious effects on multiple organ systems. In addition to diet as a source of vitamin D, vitamin D is synthesized in the skin after sun exposure. Thus, the possibility of vitamin D deficiency should be considered in patients with cutaneous lupus, particularly those who engage in strict sun-protective measures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-discoid-lupus-and-subacute-cutaneous-lupus/abstract/30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-32</a>]. In a study of 52 patients with cutaneous lupus, 65 percent exhibited 25(OH)D levels of less than 75 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L</span> (30 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL),</span> a level that is often defined as vitamin D insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-discoid-lupus-and-subacute-cutaneous-lupus/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Vitamin D levels were significantly lower in subjects who engaged in daily sunscreen use or sun avoidance compared with those who did not. Due to the potential adverse effects of vitamin D deficiency, we typically screen patients with cutaneous lupus annually for this disorder. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-d-and-extraskeletal-health\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vitamin D and extraskeletal health&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vitamin-d-deficiency-in-adults-definition-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Vitamin D deficiency in adults: Definition, clinical manifestations, and treatment&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Low levels of vitamin D may play a role in autoimmunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-discoid-lupus-and-subacute-cutaneous-lupus/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>], and it is unknown whether low levels of vitamin D increase the risk for cutaneous lupus or augment the severity of the disease. One small, uncontrolled study reported no change in disease activity with vitamin D supplementation in patients with cutaneous lupus and vitamin D deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-discoid-lupus-and-subacute-cutaneous-lupus/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. There are no high quality studies investigating the effect of vitamin D supplementation on the prevention or treatment of cutaneous lupus.

In a double-blind trial (n = 20) in which two lesions on each patient were treated with either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluocinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluocinolone</a> acetonide 0.025% ointment (a medium potency topical corticosteroid) three times daily or a vehicle control, fluocinolone was superior to the vehicle for the treatment of DLE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-discoid-lupus-and-subacute-cutaneous-lupus/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The same authors reported efficacy of fluocinolone acetonide 0.025% ointment in a series of 28 patients.

Although the use of high potency topical corticosteroids on the face is typically avoided, they are often used for the treatment of facial DLE because of the importance of disease control for the minimization of scarring.</p><p>Although there are no high quality studies of the efficacy of topical corticosteroids for the treatment of SCLE, our experiences and the clinical experiences of others support the efficacy of this therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-management-of-discoid-lupus-and-subacute-cutaneous-lupus/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. We suggest twice daily application of a super high to medium potency topical corticosteroid (class 1 to 4) as initial therapy for acute flares of SCLE (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62402\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62402 \">table 2</a>). </p><p>Improvement in DLE and SCLE with topical corticosteroids is typically noted within days to two weeks of the initiation of therapy. Data on maintenance regimens once disease control is attained are lacking. For patients with minimal disease activity on the face, we typically use twice daily application of a low-potency topical steroid (group 6 or 7) such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> 1% or 2.5% (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62402\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62402 \">table 2</a>).

In general, the lowest-potency agent that maintains disease control should be utilized. When all signs of disease activity (eg, scale or erythema) are absent, treatment can be discontinued. Scarring and dyspigmentation will be unaffected by continued treatment. </p><p>If an acute flare of DLE or SCLE has not responded to a high potency topical corticosteroid after two to four weeks, a topical calcineurin inhibitor or intralesional corticosteroid therapy should be tried (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F78893\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef78893 \">algorithm 1</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H150549\"><span class=\"h3\">Adverse effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cutaneous atrophy is a potential side effect of the long-term use of topical corticosteroids, particularly higher potency agents.
