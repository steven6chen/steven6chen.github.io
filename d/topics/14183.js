Estimates of the prevalence of shoulder pain range from 16 to 34 percent in the general population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/presentation-and-diagnosis-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Rotator cuff pathology is the most common condition of the shoulder for which patients seek treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/presentation-and-diagnosis-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Estimates published in 2004 by the United States Agency for Health Care Research and Quality and United States Department of Health and Human Services show rotator cuff problems accounted for more than 4.5 million clinician visits and approximately 40,000 surgeries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/presentation-and-diagnosis-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Despite this burden on patients and health care resources, there remains significant controversy regarding the etiology of rotator cuff injuries, the role of rotator cuff tears in generating shoulder pain, and the ability of commonly accepted clinical tests to diagnose rotor cuff tears.</p><p>The etiology, presentation, and diagnosis of rotator cuff tears will be reviewed here. The treatment of rotator cuff tears, rotator cuff tendinopathy, the shoulder examination, and the general management of patients with shoulder pain are discussed separately.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rotator-cuff-tendinopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rotator cuff tendinopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The cause of rotator cuff tears is likely multifactorial. Degeneration, impingement, and overload may all contribute in varying degrees to the development of rotator cuff tears.</p><p>Several theories have developed to explain the cause of rotator cuff injury. In 1934, Codman theorized that rotator cuff tears developed from intrinsic tissue degeneration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/presentation-and-diagnosis-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This theory was bolstered by Rothman and Parke, who suggested in 1965 that a &quot;critical zone&quot; of hypovascularity in the rotator cuff predisposed the tendon to degeneration. The role of intrinsic factors was challenged in 1972 by Neer, who suggested that impingement from extrinsic structures caused rotator cuff tears [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/presentation-and-diagnosis-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Subsequent investigations in throwing athletes suggest that tension overload contributes to these injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/presentation-and-diagnosis-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. Tension overload is thought to occur when the ability of the rotator cuff to compress and maintain the stability of the glenohumeral joint is overwhelmed by the distractive forces of throwing or trauma. In other words, rotator cuff muscle weakness allows subluxation of the glenohumeral joint, leading to impingement, which contributes to the development of rotator cuff tears.</p><p>Most often, rotator cuff lesions begin as partial tears of the undersurface or articular portion of the supraspinatus tendon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F100729\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef100729 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/presentation-and-diagnosis-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Over time they can progress to full thickness tears to include the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, subscapularis and biceps tendons.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H155772079\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rotator cuff tears are primarily a disease of middle aged and older patients. Observational data reveals a nearly linear increase in the frequency of rotator cuff tears over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/presentation-and-diagnosis-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/4,7-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7-14</a>]. However, a sizeable portion of tears in older patients are asymptomatic. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Symptoms'</a> below.)</p><p>Sports and occupations requiring overhead activity produce a high frequency of rotator cuff tears. In these patients, tears may present at a younger age and are frequently associated with labral pathology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/presentation-and-diagnosis-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/3,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,5</a>]. Smoking may be a risk factor for rotator cuff tear, as may obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/presentation-and-diagnosis-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>].</p><p>Trauma can cause rotator cuff tears. One study found that 58 percent of patients presenting to the emergency department with acute shoulder trauma and normal radiographs who were unable to abduct above 90 degrees had acute traumatic tears of the rotator cuff [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/presentation-and-diagnosis-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Tears were diagnosed by ultrasound during follow-up evaluations performed a median of 13 days following the injury.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pain and weakness may be the presenting complaints of the patient with rotator cuff tear. Classically, rotator cuff tears are associated with pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/presentation-and-diagnosis-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. Pain is said to develop over the lateral deltoid and is exacerbated by overhead activities and at night (possibly when the patients lies on the shoulder).</p><p>This classic description may be inaccurate. Several observational studies suggest that pain associated with rotator cuff tears, when present, is nonspecific and may be due to associated subacromial bursitis, not the tear itself [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/presentation-and-diagnosis-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/7,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,19</a>]. Other observational studies suggest a large portion of rotator cuff tears are asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/presentation-and-diagnosis-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/7-9,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9,20</a>]. Although some degeneration of the rotator cuff may be inevitable in most individuals beyond the fifth decade of life, these degenerative changes do not necessarily cause significant functional impairment.</p><p>To confuse matters further, some researchers find that increasing tear size correlates with more severe symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/presentation-and-diagnosis-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/7,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,10</a>], while others do not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/presentation-and-diagnosis-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Some researchers maintain that partial thickness tears create significantly more pain and disability than full thickness tears [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/presentation-and-diagnosis-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>].</p><p>The understanding of the relationship between rotator cuff tears and shoulder pain is evolving. Clinicians should not allow the presence or absence of pain to play too significant a role in diagnosis.</p><p>Weakness is another frequently cited symptom of rotator cuff tears and in large or full thickness tears represents an integral part of the diagnosis. Weakness may be apparent in otherwise asymptomatic individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/presentation-and-diagnosis-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. However, using the physical examination to isolate rotator cuff weakness can be problematic. In addition, pain from bursitis, impingement, or trauma can lead to reflex muscle inhibition and weakness unrelated to rotator cuff injury. Distinguishing between reflex muscle inhibition and true weakness is the rationale behind using a diagnostic injection of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> as part of the clinical evaluation for rotator cuff tears. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rotator-cuff-tendinopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rotator cuff tendinopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although many textbooks and clinicians have long advocated the use of physical examination to determine the presence of rotator cuff pathology, well-performed studies to support particular examination techniques or approaches are scarce. We use a combination of three tests to determine the likelihood of a rotator cuff tear and the need for further work-up:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Active painful arc test (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F70787\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70787 \">picture 1</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drop arm test (failure to smoothly control shoulder adduction)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weakness in external rotation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F77117\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77117 \">picture 2</a>)</p><p/><p>Performance of these and other examination techniques for the shoulder is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-examination-of-the-shoulder#H1180003\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical examination of the shoulder&quot;, section on 'Examination for rotator cuff pathology'</a>.)</p><p>This approach is based primarily upon our clinical experience and the results of a prospective observational study of 552 patients who were systematically evaluated using eight common shoulder examination tests and then underwent diagnostic arthroscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/presentation-and-diagnosis-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Logistic regression analysis found that the combination of a positive painful arc sign, positive drop arm test, and weakness in external rotation accurately predicted full-thickness rotator cuff tear (LR 15.6), while a combination of three negative tests made the diagnosis unlikely (LR 0.16). This study is among the few well-performed trials to assess shoulder examination techniques that include a sufficient number of patients to draw meaningful conclusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/presentation-and-diagnosis-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>A similar study assessed the accuracy of 23 clinical tests in 400 patients who subsequently underwent arthroscopic surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/presentation-and-diagnosis-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. According to this study, patients with shoulder pain who demonstrated supraspinatus and infraspinatus weakness and a positive impingement sign had a 98 percent chance of having a full thickness tear. Among patients 60 years or older with positive findings of any two of these three tests, there was again a 98 percent chance of tear. The study did not include descriptions of the techniques used for clinical testing, making it difficult to replicate the protocol. We have included descriptions of the most commonly used tests for the signs they describe (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F77117\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77117 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74738\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74738 \">picture 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F60425\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60425 \">picture 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F76237\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76237 \">picture 5</a>). A prospective observational study of 208 patients with shoulder pain reported that the &ldquo;Hornblower Sign,&rdquo; which involves resisted external rotation while the shoulder is held in 90 degrees of abduction, is specific for infraspinatus tear, but additional study is needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/presentation-and-diagnosis-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>If one assumes a pretest probability for rotator cuff tear of 30 to 70 percent, the combination of clinical tests described in either of these studies would effectively rule in full thickness tears if all were positive. If all were negative, the latter study's combination would rule out full thickness rotator cuff tear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/presentation-and-diagnosis-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>] while the former study's combination would rule out full thickness tear in patients over 60 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/presentation-and-diagnosis-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Systematic reviews of studies assessing clinical tests for the shoulder report a wide range of approaches and methodologic quality, thereby precluding meaningful meta-analysis of tests for rotator cuff integrity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/presentation-and-diagnosis-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. In addition, individual analyses of the 15 available studies in one review showed that only 8 studies met quality criteria and none of the individual clinical tests included among these studies was consistently diagnostic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/presentation-and-diagnosis-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. This highlights the difficulty in recommending evidence-based clinical tests for rotator cuff tears and the importance of continued research. The results of another systematic review of five relatively high quality studies of maneuvers to detect rotator cuff injury reinforces the limitations of studies performed to date and the potential for both type 1 and type 2 errors when clinicians attempt to detect rotator cuff tears based upon a single maneuver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/presentation-and-diagnosis-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].&nbsp;Accurate diagnosis of partial thickness tears or tears of specific rotator cuff muscles and tendons through clinical testing remains challenging, and our review of the literature did not yield sufficient high quality evidence to determine whether any particular test or combination of tests is best for diagnosing these conditions. We believe that rotator cuff tears should be suspected or ruled out on the basis of the history and a combination of examination tests, and prefer the combination listed at the beginning of this section.</p><p>The concept of muscle lag provides the basis for several published tests of rotator cuff integrity. These tests require further study and are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physical-examination-of-the-shoulder#H1180134\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physical examination of the shoulder&quot;, section on 'Testing for rotator cuff tear'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H155772325\"><span class=\"h1\">IMAGING STUDIES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Plain radiographs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although usually normal, anterior-posterior, lateral, and outlet views of the shoulder can be of value in assessing large, chronic rotator cuff tears. These studies can help to confirm the diagnosis by showing whether the humeral head is migrating relative to the glenoid and acromion. The clinician can expect larger rotator cuff tears (&gt;1.75 cm) and probable involvement of both the supraspinatus and the infraspinatus among individuals with a symptomatic shoulder and humeral migration on plain radiographs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/presentation-and-diagnosis-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Plain films also allow for the evaluation of some concomitant or alternative shoulder pathology.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Musculoskeletal ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Musculoskeletal ultrasound (MSK US) is an accurate tool for the evaluation of superficial tendon and muscle lesions, as well as bursitis, of the shoulder, and enables dynamic examination at the bedside. Its role in the evaluation of the rotator cuff and performance of the shoulder ultrasound examination are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rotator-cuff-tendinopathy#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rotator cuff tendinopathy&quot;, section on 'Musculoskeletal ultrasound'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=musculoskeletal-ultrasound-of-the-shoulder\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Musculoskeletal ultrasound of the shoulder&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MRI accurately diagnoses full thickness rotator cuff tears and many partial tears (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F100729\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef100729 \">figure 2</a>), although its sensitivity for detecting partial tears is much lower [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/presentation-and-diagnosis-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/33-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-36</a>]. The accuracy of MRI for detecting tears may also be limited in patients with severe glenohumeral osteoarthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/presentation-and-diagnosis-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. MRI often provides information about the degree of tear, tendon retraction, and muscle atrophy, all of which is critical in preoperative planning for rotator cuff repair. Conversely, MRI may reveal tears that are not amenable to operative management, such as chronic retracted tendon tears. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-rotator-cuff-tears\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of rotator cuff tears&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Interpretation of the MRI must be clinically correlated due to the high rate of asymptomatic tears. An observational study of MRI performed in 96 asymptomatic individuals showed rotator cuff tears in 34 percent of subjects, and nearly 54 percent of those over 60 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/presentation-and-diagnosis-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. MRI can be used if the diagnosis remains unclear after initial evaluation or if definitive confirmation of the diagnosis is needed for guidance about surgery or return to sport.</p><p>Rotator cuff tears are diagnosed on MRI based upon discontinuity of the tendon on T-1 weighted images and a fluid signal on T-2 weighted images. Ancillary findings include fluid in the subacromial space on T-2 images, loss of the subacromial fat plane on T-1 images, and proliferative spur formation of the acromion or acromioclavicular joint. Large chronic tears may be associated with cephalad migration of the humeral head and fatty atrophy of the supraspinatus and infraspinatus muscle bellies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/presentation-and-diagnosis-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In addition to rotator cuff pathology, MRI allows visualization of periarticular soft tissues, including the capsulolabral complex and biceps tendon.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H58593528\"><span class=\"h2\">Arthrography with MRI or CT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Magnetic resonance arthrography (MRI-A) is more sensitive and specific for diagnosing partial thickness rotator cuff tears than standard MRI, but it too has limited accuracy, especially for certain types of tears [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/presentation-and-diagnosis-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/33,34,39-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34,39-42</a>]. In addition, MRI-A is not usually obtained as part of the diagnostic workup for rotator cuff tears and is usually reserved for cases when a labral injury is suspected.</p><p>According to small prospective studies using findings at arthroscopy as the gold standard, the diagnostic performance of arthrography with computed tomography (CT) is similar to that of MRI-A for detecting rotator cuff tears [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/presentation-and-diagnosis-of-rotator-cuff-tears/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. CT arthrography may be useful in patients requiring more sophisticated imaging to assess the rotator cuff but who cannot undergo MRI-A (eg, body metal, pacemaker).
