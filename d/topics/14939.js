He or she might have ways to reduce the costs of your medicines or be able to help in other ways. Do not skip doses or take smaller doses to try to save money. This could cause serious health problems.</p><p>The steps listed below include helpful ways to lower the costs of medicines in the United States (US), but might also be useful in other countries.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10868296\"><span class=\"h2\">What if I do not have health insurance?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you live in the US and do not have health insurance, look into getting insured. In many states, more people are eligible for lower-cost insurance or Medicaid. Most insurance options include prescription coverage. For information about health insurance options, visit the <a href=\"https://www.healthcare.gov/&amp;token=sL+p+gWoM5K8OZ3TcR7z2W4ppAPQqlX42naDGC0Fe6vcWtg5QJbQrCVTKNGQsEX+&amp;TOPIC_ID=16338\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.healthcare.gov</a> website.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H369443675\"><span class=\"h2\">What if I have Medicare?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medicare offers low-cost prescription coverage called Part D. The ways of lowering medicine costs listed here work if you have or can get Part D prescription coverage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24779534\"><span class=\"h1\">Ask for medicines that are available as generics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ask your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist if any of the medicines you take are &quot;brand-name&quot; medicines, which could be switched for less expensive &quot;generic&quot; medicines. Generic medicines are copies of brand-name medicines, and are usually much less expensive. They contain the exact same medicine as the brand-name medicine, and they have been tested and shown to be just as good. The table shows how some generic medicine prices compare with the brand versions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F90835\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90835 \">table 1</a>). Many newer medicines do not come as generics. So it's not always possible to switch to generics. But when it is possible, it can save a lot of money &ndash; even if you have insurance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1038965129\"><span class=\"h1\">Look into non-prescription versions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some medicines your doctor can prescribe are also sold without a prescription, or &quot;over the counter.&quot; If your prescription medicine is also sold without a prescription at a lower price, ask your doctor if you can take that instead. This is often true for stomach medicines, allergy medicines, and pain relievers.</p><p>Any time you switch a medicine, you must work closely with your doctor. With some switches, your doctor might need to check to be sure it is working right for you. Also, a medicine sold without a prescription might not be exactly the same as the prescription version, even if it has the same name. Your doctor can help make sure you are taking the right medicine and dose.</p><p>When you switch, learn what the new medicine looks like and which medicine it replaces. That way you don't end up taking both the new one and the old one at the same time by mistake.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24779549\"><span class=\"h1\">Always compare prices</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There can be <strong>big</strong> differences in the price charged for the exact same medicine depending on what store you are using. Shopping around for a good price on your prescriptions can save you <strong>a lot</strong> of money, especially for generics.</p><p>Big chain retail stores often have great prices on many generic medicines. Their prices can be as low as $4 for 1 month and $10 for 3 months. Find out if the medicines you take are sold at low prices by asking at the store or by going online. To find information online, type the store's name and the words &quot;prescription program&quot; into Google or another search engine. These low prices can be less than your co-pay if you have prescription drug coverage.</p><p>To make shopping around easier, you can usually get a price from a pharmacy over the telephone. You can also check a website called &quot;GoodRx.&quot; This site compares local prices and has discount coupons.</p><p>The table shows how some generic and non-prescription medicine prices compare with the brand-name versions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F90835\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90835 \">table 1</a>). Depending on which pharmacy you use, you might need a store club membership or a store discount card to get prices like these. There are also resources for ideas on how to get the lowest price for your prescriptions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F69738\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69738 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>If you take several medicines and want to buy them from different pharmacies, let your doctor know. Also, be sure to give each pharmacy a full list of the medicines you take. They can check for drug interactions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24779556\"><span class=\"h1\">Make the most of your insurance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have insurance, there are lots of things you can do to get the most out of your coverage. Take time to learn about your drug coverage options. If you are eligible for Medicare Part D, reliable help is available (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F60545\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60545 \">table 3</a>).</p><p>Each year, get a list of the drugs covered by your plan. This is called the &quot;formulary.&quot; Also, get written information about:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Co-pays</strong> &ndash; Co-pays are the amount of money you pay each time you get a prescription filled.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Tiers</strong> &ndash; Most insurance companies put drugs into different categories or &quot;tiers&quot; that have different co-pay amounts. Drugs in tier 1 are usually the cheapest. Drugs in tier 3 are usually the most expensive.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Deductibles</strong> &ndash; A deductible is the total amount of money you must spend before your insurance starts to pay for anything.</p><p/><p>Bring the list of medicines covered by your insurance and their cost to your doctor visits. Then, ask your doctor if any of the medicines on the list can replace any you take that are expensive or not covered.</p><p>Most drug coverage plans offer a mail-order option, which can save you money on medicines you take for 3 months or longer. Mail-order is a good idea only after you know for sure that you will be taking a medicine at the same dose for at least 3 months.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24779563\"><span class=\"h1\">Make sure you need all the medicines you take</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some people are prescribed more medicines than they really need. That might happen if you see 2 different doctors who prescribe medicines that do the same thing. To avoid this problem, bring a list of all the medicines you take each time you visit any doctor. You can find an example of this kind of list at the following website: <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/drugs/resourcesforyou/ucm079489.htm&amp;token=SHauxSdf9qNc6lLK16E8IOhw8tWkhkVaWidZQDUIbu9gDMhwPSip8u9zifYOMQtFzUgxleN7AXwBD6pfdpaGrA==&amp;TOPIC_ID=16338\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.fda.gov/Drugs/ResourcesForYou/ucm079489.htm</a>. Ask your doctor to review your medicine list to make sure the list has no mistakes. It also helps to bring a bag containing <strong>all</strong> of your medicines with you to the doctor's office to have it checked.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1038965154\"><span class=\"h1\">Ask about splitting pills</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some medicines cost the same no matter what strength the pill is. In some cases, you can get pills at double the strength you need, and get new instructions from your doctor to cut the pills in half. That way you take half a pill for each dose and get your medicine at about half the cost.</p><p>Splitting certain pills can save money for people with <strong>no</strong> prescription drug coverage, or for people with prescription coverage that has a dollar amount limit.</p><p>Many pills, including some used to treat high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and diabetes, can be safely split in half. But it is <strong>not</strong> safe to split <strong>all</strong> medicines. If you want to try pill splitting, <strong>first</strong> ask your doctor or pharmacist if it's a good idea and if it will save you money. If he or she says it is OK to split a pill, make sure you understand the new instructions and always use a pill splitter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F60444\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60444 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24779570\"><span class=\"h1\">Get help paying for the medicines you need</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you still can't afford your medicines even after following the steps described above, you might be able to get help another way. There are state and federal programs that help people pay for their medicines. Plus, there are programs paid for by non-profit groups and by drug companies. These programs choose which people to help based on their income, the size of their family, and other factors. Ask your doctor, pharmacist, or social worker if these programs are available to you (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F76736\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76736 \">table 4</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24779577\"><span class=\"h1\">Foreign or internet-only pharmacies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stay away from any pharmacy that will sell you prescription medicines without a prescription from a doctor who has actually seen you. Some Internet and foreign pharmacies are not licensed or inspected the way they should be. They could sell you medicines that are not right for you or that are expired or even fake.</p><p>If you decide to use an internet pharmacy to save on your prescriptions, look for one that has been certified by the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F69738\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69738 \">table 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24779706\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=brand-versus-generic-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Brand versus generic medicines (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=reducing-the-costs-of-medicines-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Reducing the costs of medicines (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
