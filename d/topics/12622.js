Clinicians should assist in empowering patients with epilepsy to lead lifestyles consistent with their capabilities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>The optimal treatment plan is derived following an accurate diagnosis of the patient's seizure type(s), an objective measure of the intensity and frequency of the seizures, awareness of medication side effects, and an evaluation of disease-related psychosocial problems. A working knowledge of available antiseizure drugs, including their mechanisms of action, pharmacokinetics, drug-drug interactions, and adverse effects, is essential.</p><p>It is usually appropriate to refer the patient to a neurologist when establishing a diagnosis and formulating a course of treatment. Referral to an epilepsy specialist may be necessary if there is doubt about the diagnosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> if the patient continues to have seizures.</p><p>The overall approach to management of a patient with seizures is reviewed here. Evaluation of the patient who has had a first seizure and the pharmacology of specific antiseizure drugs are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-the-first-seizure-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of the first seizure in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of epilepsy in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antiseizure-drugs-mechanism-of-action-pharmacology-and-adverse-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antiseizure drugs: Mechanism of action, pharmacology, and adverse effects&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first step in designing a treatment plan is to classify the patient's seizure type(s) using the framework of the International League Against Epilepsy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F91409\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91409 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. Seizure types and epilepsy syndromes are classified primarily upon clinical grounds, assisted by laboratory, neurophysiologic, and radiographic studies. Seizure type has important implications in the choice of antiseizure drugs. Accurate classification requires a full history from the patient and reports from observers who have witnessed actual seizures. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ilae-classification-of-seizures-and-epilepsy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ILAE classification of seizures and epilepsy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients may be better able to describe their seizure symptoms after reading published seizure descriptions, which in turn may improve the clinician's ability to categorize the seizure type and to plan a successful therapeutic approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Many patients experience more than one type of seizure (eg, focal seizures and secondarily generalized seizures).</p><p>Pointed questions may be necessary to reveal behaviors or environmental factors that contribute to the incidence of seizures. These &quot;seizure triggers,&quot; such as sleep deprivation, alcohol intake, and stress, may be modifiable. Thus, taking steps that limit exposure to these triggers usually enhances the benefits of antiseizure drug therapy.</p><p>There are two broad categories of seizures: focal (or partial) and generalized (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F91409\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef91409 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F94645\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef94645 \">table 2</a>). Focal seizures involve only a portion of the brain, typically part of one lobe of one hemisphere. A focal seizure can be associated with impairment of awareness (previously called complex partial seizure) or no impairment of awareness (previously called simple partial seizures). A focal seizure can evolve over seconds into a bilateral tonic-clonic seizure, also referred to as a secondarily generalized seizure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-management-of-the-first-seizure-in-adults#H1446120106\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and management of the first seizure in adults&quot;, section on 'Types of seizures'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ANTISEIZURE DRUG THERAPY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">When to start antiseizure drug therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immediate antiseizure drug therapy is usually not necessary in individuals after a single seizure, particularly if a first seizure is provoked by factors that resolve. Antiseizure drug therapy should be started in patients who are at significant risk for recurrent seizures, such as those with remote symptomatic seizures. Antiseizure drug treatment is generally started after two or more unprovoked seizures, because the recurrence proves that the patient has a substantially increased risk for repeated seizures, well above 50 percent.</p><p>The issues to be considered in deciding when to start antiseizure drug therapy are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of epilepsy in adults&quot;, section on 'When to start antiseizure drug therapy'</a>.)</p><p>Antiseizure drug therapy is not necessarily lifelong.

Tolerability of side effects is as important as efficacy in determining the overall effectiveness of treatment. No single antiseizure drug is optimal for every patient or even most patients. The selection of a specific antiseizure drug for treating seizures must be individualized considering:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drug effectiveness for the seizure type or types (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F78021\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78021 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F106663\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef106663 \">table 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Potential adverse effects of the drug (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F59755\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59755 \">table 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F78896\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78896 \">table 6</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Interactions with other medications</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Comorbid medical conditions, especially, but not limited to, hepatic and renal disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age and gender, including childbearing plans</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lifestyle and patient preferences</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cost</p><p/><p>In general, enzyme-inducing antiseizure drugs (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenobarbital-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenobarbital</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primidone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">primidone</a>, and less so, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxcarbazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxcarbazepine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=topiramate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">topiramate</a>) are the most problematic for drug interactions with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> and oral contraceptive therapy, as well as certain anticancer and anti-infective drugs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F60182\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60182 \">table 7</a>). Specific interactions of antiseizure drugs with other medications may be determined using the drug interactions tool (Lexi-Interact online) included in UpToDate. This tool can be accessed from the UpToDate online search page or through the individual drug information topics in the section on Drug interactions.</p><p>Issues to consider in selecting a specific antiseizure drug are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of epilepsy in adults&quot;, section on 'Selection of an antiseizure drug'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Subsequent drug trials</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately half of patients with a new diagnosis of epilepsy are successfully treated with the first antiseizure drug prescribed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/8,9,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9,11</a>]. Treatment failure may result from breakthrough seizures or drug intolerance. At this point, a second drug trial should be attempted. When the initial drug failure is due to adverse effects, the second drug trial will be successful in approximately half of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Substantially fewer patients (approximately 10 to 20 percent) will have a successful second drug trial if the initial failure was due to lack of efficacy. Other factors that decrease the likelihood of success include younger age, female gender, high generalized tonic-clonic seizure burden, and the presence of structural abnormalities on computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Similar factors are considered when a second antiseizure drug is chosen as when the first was selected (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Choosing an antiseizure drug'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of epilepsy in adults&quot;</a>). However, the clinician may also choose to select an antiseizure drug with a somewhat different mechanism of action (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F71274\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71274 \">table 8</a>) in hopes that efficacy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> tolerance will be improved compared with the first drug used. It remains important to choose a drug with demonstrated efficacy for the patient's seizure type [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>] and to avoid drugs that may precipitate or aggravate seizures; the latter is most relevant in patients with genetic generalized epilepsies such as juvenile myoclonic epilepsy or absence epilepsy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=juvenile-myoclonic-epilepsy#H1409498\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Juvenile myoclonic epilepsy&quot;, section on 'Antiseizure drugs to avoid'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=childhood-absence-epilepsy#H3777258\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Childhood absence epilepsy&quot;, section on 'Drugs to avoid'</a>.)</p><p>Except in the case of a serious adverse event, the second medication is typically increased to therapeutic levels before the first agent is reduced in order to prevent a flurry of seizures or status epilepticus during the switch-over period. The second antiseizure medication is gradually titrated up slowly to effect (control of seizures) or to toxicity (side effects). However, patients should expect a temporary increase in side effects during the overlap period that will likely abate when the first antiseizure drug is subsequently tapered off.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Combination therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When possible, it is preferable to maintain a patient on a single antiseizure drug. This increases the probability of compliance, provides a wider therapeutic index, and is more cost effective than combination drug treatment. Monotherapy is also associated with fewer idiosyncratic reactions and a lower incidence of teratogenic effects. Combination therapy can be associated with drug interactions between antiseizure drugs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F80801%7ENEURO%2F55399%7ENEURO%2F53463\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80801 graphicRef55399 graphicRef53463 \">table 9A-C</a>), making it difficult to dose and monitor patients.</p><p>This conventional wisdom is only partly supported by published data, which give conflicting information regarding the risks and benefits of mono- versus polytherapy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one large case series of 809 patients with refractory epilepsy, rates of adverse events did not differ between patients on poly- versus monotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one clinical trial, rates of adverse events were similar among 157 patients randomized to adjunctive treatment versus alternative monotherapy, and rates of seizure remission were also similar (16 versus 14 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A randomized, double-blind study that compared <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a> monotherapy with combination therapy with carbamazepine and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valproate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valproate</a> found no significant difference in neurotoxicity between the two groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one epidemiologic survey, polytherapy was associated with lower quality of life and lower rates of employment compared with patients on monotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p>There are few controlled studies comparing different drug combinations, and virtually every possible combination of antiseizure drugs has been tried. A 2011 meta-analysis of 70 randomized controlled trials of antiseizure drugs administered as add-on therapy in patients with refractory focal epilepsy found that differences in efficacy were of too small magnitude to allow a conclusion about which antiseizure drug is more effective as adjunctive therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

In this way, it is hoped that efficacy can be maximized and side effects minimized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The benefit of this approach is largely theoretical, supported by limited observational data but not well tested prospectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. However, there is some anecdotal evidence that synergism between antiseizure drugs can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/24-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-28</a>]. As an example, a post hoc analysis of pooled data from randomized trials suggested greater benefit and less toxicity when <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lacosamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lacosamide</a>, a sodium channel-blocking drug, was used in combination with nonsodium channel-blocking drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Seizure remission is achieved with combination therapy in only a small percentage (10 to 15 percent) of patients who have failed monotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/12,29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,29,30</a>]. One retrospective chart review suggested that while two concurrent antiseizure drugs might provide efficacy over monotherapy, use of three antiseizure drugs did not provide further benefit over two [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>While the chances of treatment success diminish incrementally with each successive drug trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>], two studies suggest a value in pursuing further drug trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].

In another, 28 percent of patients with a history of uncontrolled seizures for five or more years were subsequently controlled on antiseizure drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. In some cases, response to treatment occurred with a fourth or fifth drug trial. Both studies found that the number of previous failed trials was a negative prognostic indicator, and a history of status epilepticus, younger age at intractability, underlying mental retardation, longer duration of epilepsy, and symptomatic epilepsy were each negative predictors in one of the two studies.</p><p>Overall, up to 80 percent of patients can become seizure free on antiseizure drug treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/13,29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,29-31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Side effects of therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During the first six months of treatment, systemic toxicity and neurotoxicity cause antiseizure drug failure to the same degree as lack of efficacy against seizures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F59755\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59755 \">table 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F78896\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78896 \">table 6</a>). Serum levels that are associated with neurotoxicity vary from patient to patient, and toxicity can occur even when measured levels are considered to be within the appropriate therapeutic range.</p><p>The usual strategy in patients experiencing peak-level side effects from a specific drug is to alter the medication regimen or treatment schedule to minimize side effects; one alteration may be to spread the medication over more doses throughout the day. The clinician should attempt to correlate serum drug concentrations with the patient's side effects before abandoning that medication. Specifically, obtaining levels when a patient is experiencing side effects and comparing them with levels obtained when the patient is free from symptoms can be helpful in the management of some patients.</p><p>It can be also be useful to refer to the patient's seizure calendar in planning the timing of drug levels in an attempt to prove a cause-and-effect relationship between peak levels and side effects. As an example, in a patient who experiences seizures only at night but who has side effects in the afternoon from his or her morning dose of antiseizure drugs, shifting part of the morning dose to the bedtime dose may eliminate these side effects while improving seizure control.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Specific adverse reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many side effects of antiseizure drugs specific to individual medications are reviewed in detail separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antiseizure-drugs-mechanism-of-action-pharmacology-and-adverse-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antiseizure drugs: Mechanism of action, pharmacology, and adverse effects&quot;</a>).

The elevated risk (0.43 versus 0.22 percent) was observed as early as one week after starting medication and continued through the 24 weeks of study observation. The effect was consistent in the 11 antiseizure drugs studied, and the FDA considers this risk likely to be shared by all antiseizure drugs.

The risk of this scenario appears to be small, however [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/140,141\" class=\"abstract_t\">140,141</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2159256527\"><span class=\"h2\">Estimating risk of seizure recurrence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no certain way to prospectively identify patients who will remain seizure free after they discontinue antiseizure drug therapy and no high-quality studies to guide decision making. In addition to confirming the time elapsed since the last seizure, clinicians should review the epilepsy history and most recent neuroimaging studies. An electroencephalogram (EEG) is often obtained to help with risk stratification, as epileptiform abnormalities are a risk factor for seizure recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/140\" class=\"abstract_t\">140</a>]. However, their contribution appears to be quite modest beyond what is derived from other clinical factors, and we do not routinely obtain an EEG in all patients who are considering drug discontinuation.</p><p>Based on a meta-analysis of observational studies with varying entry criteria and patient characteristics at the time of drug discontinuation in nearly 10,000 patients, the cumulative seizure recurrence rate after drug withdrawal in patients with epilepsy is approximately 35 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/142\" class=\"abstract_t\">142</a>]. In nonsurgical cohorts, approximately two-thirds of recurrences occur within the first year after drug discontinuation; in surgical cohorts, only half of eventual recurrences occur within the first year. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-treatment-of-epilepsy-in-adults#H7379339\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical treatment of epilepsy in adults&quot;, section on 'Antiseizure drug management after surgery'</a>.)</p><p>The two largest prospective studies comparing continued antiseizure drug treatment with drug withdrawal reported the following results:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The first study included 1013 patients with epilepsy who had been seizure free for at least two years (range two to six years); these patients were randomly assigned to either continued antiseizure drug treatment or slow withdrawal of drug therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/143\" class=\"abstract_t\">143</a>]. By two years after randomization, 41 and 22 percent of patients, respectively, experienced seizure relapse. The most important factors predicting outcome were longer seizure-free periods before attempting drug withdrawal (which reduced seizure recurrence) and a history of tonic-clonic seizures treated with more than one antiseizure drug (which increased recurrence).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The second study included 330 patients with epilepsy who were also seizure free for two years on a single antiseizure drug and had consented to drug withdrawal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/144\" class=\"abstract_t\">144</a>]. Approximately two-thirds of the patients elected to proceed with drug withdrawal, and the remaining one-third continued therapy. The overall rate of seizure relapse was higher among those who discontinued therapy (50 versus 28 percent). Among those who discontinued therapy, the probabilities of relapse at one, two, three, and five years were 26, 43, 49, and 52 percent, respectively. Duration of active disease and length of remission before antiseizure drug withdrawal were influenced the risk of relapse.</p><p/><p>More than 20 different variables have been associated with risk of seizure recurrence upon antiseizure drug discontinuation in individual studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/142\" class=\"abstract_t\">142</a>]. In a meta-analysis of individual patient data from 10 studies and 1769 patients examining risk of seizure recurrence after drug discontinuation, the following factors were independent predictors of seizure recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/140\" class=\"abstract_t\">140</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epilepsy duration before remission (longer duration associated with higher risk)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seizure-free interval before antiseizure drug withdrawal (shorter interval associated with higher risk)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Age at onset of epilepsy (onset in adulthood associated with higher risk)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of febrile seizures</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Number of seizures before remission (&ge;10 associated with higher risk)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Absence of a self-limiting epilepsy syndrome (eg, absence epilepsy, benign epilepsy with centrotemporal spikes)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epileptiform abnormality on EEG before withdrawal</p><p/><p>The magnitude of risk for any one of these variables ranged from 1.3 to 1.5 times the risk of recurrence compared with the absence of the variable. A history of seizure recurrence with past attempts at drug withdrawal was not an independent predictor of future failure.</p><p>A nomogram for individualized prediction of recurrence risk derived from the patient-level data in this meta-analysis is available at <a href=\"http://epilepsypredictiontools.info/&amp;token=24H04TWLpMYkpaOENwewf8OD9pkAmkRmmedm9Ev1aWn/Afh1sX2p9mT5sSfKvnD+&amp;TOPIC_ID=2220\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">http://epilepsypredictiontools.info</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/140\" class=\"abstract_t\">140</a>]. The nomogram should not be used as a substitute for an individualized discussion of a full range of potential risks and benefits. It does not apply to patients with acute symptomatic seizures or neonatal seizures, as these populations were not included in the study, or to patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy, who were underrepresented and who are known to have a high rate of seizure relapse (&gt;80 percent) with attempted antiseizure drug withdrawal. Patients who have had epilepsy surgery were also underrepresented in the study.

The approach should be neither dogmatic nor inflexible. Each patient should have a reasonable understanding of the possible risks and benefits related to discontinuing drugs that are relevant to his or her own case. As an example, one may have quite different recommendations regarding antiseizure drug withdrawal in a 25-year-old woman who wishes to become pregnant than in a 25-year-old man whose livelihood depends on driving.</p><p>Even patients who are seizure free for several years and have none of the risk factors listed above still have approximately a 20 to 25 percent risk of seizure recurrence after antiseizure drug withdrawal, a much higher risk of seizures than the general population.</p><p>Because this risk cannot be known exactly for any given patient, and as the timing of a seizure recurrence cannot be predicted, many patients elect to continue antiseizure drug therapy rather than risk having seizures recur. However, one should also keep in mind that the risk is not zero even with continued antiseizure drugs; in most studies, the risk is halved if antiseizure drugs are continued.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33\"><span class=\"h2\">Withdrawal schedule</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no data that indicate an optimal tapering regimen when the decision is made to discontinue antiseizure drug therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-management-of-epilepsy-in-adults/abstract/151\" class=\"abstract_t\">151</a>].

Selection of an antiseizure drug is individualized based upon the seizure type; potential adverse effects; interactions with other medications; comorbid medical conditions; age and gender, including childbearing plans; lifestyle and patient preferences; and cost.

Antiseizure drug therapy is as likely to fail from adverse effects of medication as from lack of efficacy. The chance of successful antiseizure drug treatment diminishes with each unsuccessful drug trial. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Subsequent drug trials'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regular outpatient office visits that include patient education, review of adverse medication effects, seizure calendar, and drug monitoring are suggested to improve compliance and the likelihood of a successful outcome.
