The interaction of neutrophils with the foreign body diminishes neutrophil function, which may enhance susceptibility to infection. In animal models, the presence of a foreign body reduces the minimal inoculum of <em>S. aureus</em> required to cause infection by a factor of more than 100,000 to as little as 100 colony-forming units. In addition, it is difficult for the host to eradicate mesh-related infections related to the formation of biofilm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wound-infection-following-repair-of-abdominal-wall-hernia/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

In a retrospective review of 3470 cases of abdominal wall hernia repairs, 2 percent developed mesh infections, most of which (73 percent) required explantation of the mesh [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wound-infection-following-repair-of-abdominal-wall-hernia/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Predictors of mesh infection included steroid or other immunosuppressive drug use, urgent repair, and postoperative surgical site infection; predictors of mesh explantation were polytetrafluoroethylene mesh, onlay mesh position, and associated enterotomy in the same procedure. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8484999\"><span class=\"h3\">Non-mesh versus mesh repairs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are conflicting data regarding whether the use of mesh during hernia repair definitely results in a greater risk for infection than traditional repair without mesh.

Monofilament meshes with large pore sizes (&gt;75 micrometers) are associated with lower risk of infection. Microporous meshes (eg, expanded polytetrafluoroethylene [ePTFE]) with a pore size &lt;10 micrometers allow free passage to bacteria but block neutrophils and macrophages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wound-infection-following-repair-of-abdominal-wall-hernia/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. </p><p>Biologic meshes may be derived from human (allograft) or animal (xenograft &ndash; typically bovine or porcine). The most common tissue used is decellularized dermis, which provides a collagen matrix. The porcine meshes are the most commonly used, and the different products differ in the use of supplemental cross-linking (cross-linked: Permacol and Collamend; non-cross-linked: Strattus, Integen, XCM, and XenMatrix).

Biologic meshes do clear bacterial contamination better than synthetic materials. However, one study showed a difference in the rate of clearance of <em>S. aureus</em> between synthetic meshes versus cross-linked biologic meshes, which had a higher residual contamination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wound-infection-following-repair-of-abdominal-wall-hernia/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. </p><p>In general, a permanent synthetic mesh is the most common mesh used, but the use of biomaterials is rapidly expanding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wound-infection-following-repair-of-abdominal-wall-hernia/abstract/1,10,40-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,10,40-44</a>].

Bacteria near the surface of the biofilm are usually relatively more metabolically active via their access to nutrients that diffuse through the upper surface of the biofilm; bacteria deep within the biofilm are usually less metabolically active or in various stages of dormancy. Bacteria within biofilms are protected from host defenses such as phagocytes and, often, to antimicrobial penetration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4285224\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of wound infection following hernia repair includes allergies to skin preparation materials or adhesives, seroma or hematoma, foreign body reactions to the mesh materials, post-herniorrhaphy neuralgia, necrotizing fasciitis, and gastrointestinal fistula. </p><p>Allergic skin reactions typically occur in the immediate postoperative period and are self-limiting with removal of the offending agent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=common-allergens-in-allergic-contact-dermatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Common allergens in allergic contact dermatitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-control-measures-for-prevention-of-surgical-site-infection-in-adults#H24969720\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of control measures for prevention of surgical site infection in adults&quot;, section on 'Skin antisepsis'</a>.)</p><p>Fluid collections such as seromas, or hematomas occurring in the early postoperative period, can cause wound swelling but are not associated with signs of infection (ie, erythema, warmth, drainage). These should generally not be aspirated due to the risk of introducing infection into a sterile site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wound-infection-following-repair-of-abdominal-wall-hernia/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H4284549\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> below.)</p><p>A severe foreign body reaction may initially be difficult to distinguish from a wound infection as the clinical features may include erythema and pain; however, no fluid accumulation or drainage will be evident. Significant pain without other signs of wound infection can also occur with nerve injury. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=post-herniorrhaphy-groin-pain#H4060142\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Post-herniorrhaphy groin pain&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.) </p><p>Necrotizing fasciitis is a serious form of wound infection, which can be lethal and is a surgical emergency. It is characterized by a copious dishwater-like drainage, dusky and friable subcutaneous tissue, and pale, devitalized fascia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=necrotizing-soft-tissue-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Necrotizing soft tissue infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Injury to the bowel during the course of hernia repair may lead to enterocutaneous fistula. Drainage of succus entericus or grossly feculent material makes the distinction, though it may require opening of the wound to make this determination. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-enteric-fistulas\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of enteric fistulas&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4284549\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The management of wound infection following repair of abdominal wall hernia repair includes aggressive antibiotic therapy, wound drainage, and aggressive wound debridement when appropriate. Specific wound management thereafter depends on the location and nature of the hernia repair. </p><p>If there are no systemic signs of infection, culture data should be obtained before starting broad-spectrum parenteral antibiotics listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F52962\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52962 \">table 1</a>). When available, culture findings guide changes in antibiotic therapy.

Providing drainage of the wound may require opening the skin incision, but localized fluid collections may be amenable to percutaneous aspiration.</p><p>Symptoms of infection should improve after a few days of antibiotic treatment, which should be continued for 10 to 14 days or until the clinical signs of active infection have resolved. Thereafter, the patient should be monitored closely for signs of recurrent infection. Oral antibiotics may be used to complete therapy in patients who improve quickly and can tolerate oral therapy. </p><p>If signs of superficial infection do not improve with antibiotic therapy, a deeper infection may be present, and surgical incision and drainage with debridement of infected <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> necrotic tissue may be necessary. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4284985\"><span class=\"h2\">Deep wound/mesh infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After initiating empiric antibiotic therapy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F52962\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52962 \">table 1</a>), patients who present with systemic symptoms and signs of wound infection should be taken for immediate surgical debridement to remove infected <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> necrotic tissue, and to remove the mesh, if present. Debrided material should be sent for aerobic and anaerobic culture and susceptibility results used to tailor choice of antibiotic therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=necrotizing-soft-tissue-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Necrotizing soft tissue infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For patients without systemic signs, percutaneous drainage of any fluid collections can be attempted. In a retrospective study that evaluated outcomes in 21 patients who underwent percutaneous drainage for mesh-related fluid collections, 12 patients (57 percent) were successfully treated with percutaneous drainage and antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wound-infection-following-repair-of-abdominal-wall-hernia/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. In this study, fluid cultures were positive in 68 percent of patients (n = 13); <em>S. aureus</em> was the most common organism. However, the pathogen did not predict the need for mesh excision. </p><p>If symptoms persist following wound drainage and one week of appropriate antibiotic therapy, all foreign material, including mesh, sutures, and staples (as well as necrotic tissue), should be removed when technically feasible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wound-infection-following-repair-of-abdominal-wall-hernia/abstract/69,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">69,70</a>]. Where mesh is well incorporated, whether or not to remove part of or all of the mesh is a matter of clinical judgment. One study reported successful treatment of limited mesh infections (defined as evidence of good incorporation of some of the mesh into surrounding tissue) with surgical debridement, partial excision of mesh, drain placement, and negative pressure wound therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wound-infection-following-repair-of-abdominal-wall-hernia/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. However, for mesh infections with no incorporation of mesh into the surrounding tissues, they performed complete excision of the mesh and debridement of the surrounding tissues. </p><p>Antibiotics tailored to <span class=\"nowrap\">fluid/tissue</span> culture results should be administered for at least two weeks following removal of foreign material. If symptoms of infection recur following removal of foreign material, incomplete removal with retention of mesh components should be suspected, and repeat debridement should be undertaken.</p><p>Graft removal can lead to hernia recurrence; thus, if possible, the infection should be fully eradicated before repeat hernia repair is performed. Some surgeons favor percutaneous sampling of the operative area under sterile conditions to ensure there are no residual bacteria prior to repeat hernia repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wound-infection-following-repair-of-abdominal-wall-hernia/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. If such cultures are positive, an additional two weeks of antibiotics should be administered, followed by repeat aspiration. Patients with persistently positive aspirates should undergo repeat debridement, followed by additional antibiotic therapy. When needed, methods are available to repair inguinal hernia without the use of mesh and are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=open-surgical-repair-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Open surgical repair of inguinal and femoral hernia in adults&quot;, section on 'Non-mesh repairs'</a>.) </p><p>Although there are case reports of successful treatment of mesh infections with systemic antibiotics combined with local antibiotic infusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/wound-infection-following-repair-of-abdominal-wall-hernia/abstract/73-76\" class=\"abstract_t\">73-76</a>], in the absence of well-designed trials evaluating the effectiveness of this strategy, we do not recommend these approaches except possibly as salvage therapy if mesh removal is not possible. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32537641\"><span class=\"h1\">MEASURES TO PREVENT RECURRENT INFECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>General measures to prevent a surgical site infection (SSI) following hernia repair are the same as for the prevention of infection at other surgical sites.

(See <a href=\"#H32537617\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Factors that increase the risk of wound infection following hernia repair include patient-related and technical factors such as obesity, diabetes, smoking, previous methicillin-resistant <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> (MRSA) infection, enterotomy, bowel resection, and emergent procedure. The laparoscopic technique is associated with a lower risk of superficial wound infections for groin and ventral hernia repairs compared with the open technique; however, there is no significant difference in the rate of deep wound infections necessitating mesh removal. There are conflicting data regarding whether the use of mesh during hernia repair imparts greater risk for infection than repair without mesh. (See <a href=\"#H32537617\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1987112\" class=\"local\">'Open versus laparoscopic hernia repair'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8485022\" class=\"local\">'Mesh-related factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of wound infection is clinical with typical symptoms of localized erythema and pain at the incision site, wound drainage, or separation of the wound edges. Patients may have systemic manifestations. Imaging studies can be useful to identify edema with stranding of the subcutaneous fat around the mesh and to identify fluid collections (seroma, hematoma, abscess). (See <a href=\"#H440768053\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features and diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wound cultures should be obtained to help guide antibiotic therapy. If there are no systemic signs of infection, cultures should be obtained before starting antibiotics. When available, culture findings guide changes in antibiotic therapy. The bacteria typically implicated in mesh infections are those with the capacity to form biofilm, such as coagulase-negative staphylococci, <em>S. aureus</em>, and enteric gram-negative bacilli. Anaerobes are also potential pathogens. Rarely, mesh infections can be caused by <em>Candida</em> or mycobacteria.

Most superficial wound infections can be successfully managed without the need to remove the mesh. Drainage of the wound may require opening the skin incision, but localized fluid collections may be amenable to percutaneous drainage. If signs of superficial infection do not improve with antibiotic therapy, a deeper infection should be suspected. If the wound infection is not responsive to antibiotics and drainage, surgical debridement should be performed. Whether or not to remove part of or all of the mesh is a matter of clinical judgment. Well-incorporated mesh may remain in place; however, mesh that is not incorporated can be usually be easily removed.
