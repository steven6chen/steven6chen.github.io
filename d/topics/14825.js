Of these, only a few have been directly compared in randomized clinical trials. Some well-designed studies have demonstrated clinically significant efficacy with a generally acceptable risk of toxicity.</p><p>Representative clinical trials of various combinations of nonbiologic DMARDs in early and established rheumatoid arthritis (RA) will be reviewed here. The general approach to management of RA and randomized controlled trials of biologic agents in this disease are discussed separately.

No difference in toxicity was observed between the two treatment groups.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A multicenter study in Europe enrolled 205 patients with RA who had not previously been treated with any disease-modifying antirheumatic drug(s) (DMARD[s]) and randomly assigned them to SSZ, MTX, or a combination of the two agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/randomized-clinical-trials-of-combinations-of-nonbiologic-dmards-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. After one year of concealed treatment, 146 were followed for an additional four years in an unblinded fashion and with whatever treatment was chosen by the clinicians managing their care. Five years after initial enrollment, disease activity, functional status, and radiographic scores were assessed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/randomized-clinical-trials-of-combinations-of-nonbiologic-dmards-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].

SSZ was found to be a potent inhibitor of the principal cell membrane transporter for folates as well as MTX, along with inducing cellular folate depletion. These observations led to recommendations that the drugs should not be given in combination and that folate supplementation should be administered to patients on either drug. However, the clinical relevance of this observation is suspect, as these drugs are combined effectively in triple therapy regiments.

A well-controlled, prospective randomized trial of 102 patients with established RA found that triple therapy with MTX (7.5 to 17.5 mg per week, titrated for response), SSZ (500 mg twice daily), and HCQ (200 mg twice daily) was superior to MTX alone or to SSZ plus HCQ [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/randomized-clinical-trials-of-combinations-of-nonbiologic-dmards-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The primary endpoint was at least 50 percent improvement at nine months, a benefit which had to be sustained for two years without the development of significant drug toxicity. Response was realized in 77, 40, and 33 percent of patients randomized to triple-, double-, or single-agent therapy, respectively (p = 0.003 for comparisons with the triple agent group).</p><p>Subsequent trials have documented in patients with an inadequate response to MTX monotherapy that the addition of SSZ and HCQ can result in clinical benefit that is comparable to the addition of a tumor necrosis factor inhibitor.

The HCQ dose was 200 mg twice daily.</p><p>Patients on the three-drug combination had a significantly greater proportion of ACR 20 and 50 responses than those on either of the two-drug plus placebo combinations (ACR20 responses of 78 percent, 60 percent, and 49 percent for those receiving three drugs, MTX plus HCQ, and MTX plus SSZ, respectively; ACR50 responses of 55, 40, and 29 percent, respectively).

Prednisolone and MTX were withdrawn at weeks 28 and 40, respectively. Evaluation of therapeutic efficacy was assessed via a pooled index of five disease activity measures and via radiographic outcomes. At week 28, combination therapy resulted in significant clinical benefits as determined by the pooled index when compared with SSZ alone (p&lt;0.0001). In addition, 72 and 49 percent of patients treated with combination therapy and SSZ alone had improved, respectively. These benefits were not statistically significant once prednisolone was withdrawn, and the clinical differences between the groups were unchanged after MTX was stopped. Nevertheless, radiographic benefits due to combination therapy were statistically significant at multiple time periods (weeks 28, 56, and 80).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">SSZ, HCQ, prednisolone, and MTX</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a multicenter trial (FIN-RACo), 199 patients were randomly assigned either to combination therapy consisting of MTX, SSZ, HCQ, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a>, or to single-agent therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/randomized-clinical-trials-of-combinations-of-nonbiologic-dmards-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

This was illustrated in a trial that enrolled 66 patients with early seropositive RA, each of whom received escalating doses of MTX (initial dose 7.5 mg per week, mean final dose approximately 15 mg per week) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/randomized-clinical-trials-of-combinations-of-nonbiologic-dmards-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Patients were randomly assigned to one of three groups: placebo, low-dose doxycycline (20 mg twice daily), or high-dose doxycycline (100 mg twice daily). After two years of treatment, the ACR50 response rates in the placebo, low-dose doxycycline, and high-dose doxycycline groups were 12.5, 39, and 41.6 percent, respectively, a statistically and clinically significant difference.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3603202973\"><span class=\"h1\">LEFLUNOMIDE-BASED COMBINATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to being used in combination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> (MTX) (see <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Leflunomide and MTX'</a> above), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leflunomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">leflunomide</a> (LEF) has also been studied in combination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>.
