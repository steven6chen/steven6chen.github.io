It is caused by a fungus.</p><p>PCP is most common in people who have conditions that weaken the body's infection-fighting system, called the &quot;immune system.&quot; If the immune system is weak, it cannot fight off the fungus that causes PCP. People with healthy immune systems rarely get PCP.</p><p>Conditions that increase the risk of PCP include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>HIV, a virus that affects the immune system</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An organ transplant or stem cell transplant &ndash; Stem cells are special cells that can turn into many different types of cells. For transplant, they can be taken from bone marrow or blood.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cancer, especially blood cancers such as leukemia</p><p/><p>People who take medicine that partly &quot;turns off&quot; the immune system, such as steroids, also have a higher risk of PCP. This is especially true if they also have one of the conditions listed above, such as a transplant.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31386559\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of Pneumocystis pneumonia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms of PCP can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cough &ndash; Most people have a dry cough that does not bring up mucus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling much more tired than usual</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chills</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest pain, especially when taking a deep breath</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Losing weight without trying</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31386574\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you have HIV or another condition that weakens your immune system, and 1 or more of the symptoms above, see a doctor or nurse as soon as possible. PCP can be very serious. It is important to get treatment right away.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31386589\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Probably. Your doctor or nurse will ask about your symptoms and do an exam. He or she will probably do a chest X-ray to look for infection in your lungs.</p><p>If the chest X-ray does not show infection, your doctor might do an imaging test called a &quot;CT scan&quot; if he or she still thinks you could have PCP. A CT scan creates a better image of the lungs than an X-ray does.</p><p>You might also have other tests. These can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tests on fluid from your lungs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31386604\"><span class=\"h1\">How is Pneumocystis pneumonia treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PCP is treated with medicines to kill the fungus that causes it. These include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> (brand names: Bactrim, Septra), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atovaquone-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">atovaquone</a> (brand name: Mepron), and other medicines.</p><p>Depending on your situation, your doctor might also give you steroid medicine to help your lungs get better. Steroids help by reducing inflammation in your lungs. This medicine is not the same as the steroids athletes take to build up muscle.</p><p>Some people can take medicine at home, but many people need treatment in the hospital. People who are treated in the hospital might get medicine through a thin tube that goes into their vein, called an &quot;IV.&quot; Some people also get extra oxygen to help them breathe more easily. People who are having a very hard time breathing might be treated with a breathing machine called a &quot;ventilator.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31386619\"><span class=\"h1\">How soon will I feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people start to feel better 4 to 7 days after they start taking medicine. If you do not start feeling better, the doctor can give you a different medicine or give you medicine through an IV.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31386636\"><span class=\"h1\">Can Pneumocystis pneumonia be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sometimes. Doctors can give antibiotics to people with certain medical conditions, such as HIV, and to some people with lowered immune systems who are also taking steroid pills or getting IV steroid medicines for a long time. The antibiotics help prevent PCP.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31386651\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=pneumonia-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Pneumonia in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=community-acquired-pneumonia-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Community-acquired pneumonia in adults (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=preventing-opportunistic-infections-in-hiv-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Preventing opportunistic infections in HIV (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
