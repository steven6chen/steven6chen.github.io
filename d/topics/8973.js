It is the most common of the indolent NHLs defined as those lymphomas in which survival of the untreated patient is measured in years. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-the-hematopoietic-neoplasms\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of the hematopoietic neoplasms&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Treatment of FL depends upon the stage of disease at presentation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F97479\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97479 \">table 1</a>). Patients with localized (stage I) disease are candidates for radiation therapy, which is curative in a percentage of patients. In contrast, the treatment of advanced (stage <span class=\"nowrap\">III/IV)</span> disease is not curative and focuses largely on symptom control with chemoimmunotherapy with or without radiation therapy. Even so, patients with advanced stage FL generally have an excellent prognosis.</p><p>The management of patients with stage II FL is more variable, with some clinicians offering treatment similar to that used for stage I disease and others offering treatment similar to that used for advanced stage disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-limited-stage-i-ii-follicular-lymphoma#H87719265\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of limited stage (I/II) follicular lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Stage II FL'</a>.)</p><p>The initial treatment of advanced stage <span class=\"nowrap\">(III/IV)</span> FL is discussed here. The initial treatment of limited stage <span class=\"nowrap\">(I/II)</span> FL and the management of relapsed or refractory FL are presented separately, as are the epidemiology, clinical presentation, pathologic features, diagnosis, and pathobiology of FL. Of importance, the recommendations presented here pertain to patients with histologic grade 1, 2, or 3a FL; patients with grade 3b FL are treated as aggressive lymphomas (eg, diffuse large B cell lymphoma).

These investigations are important for determining the treatment strategy and for predicting outcome with the Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) or one of its variants. General approaches to the diagnostic work-up and staging of NHL are presented separately (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F97479\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97479 \">table 1</a>). The pre-treatment evaluation for patients with advanced stage FL is the same as that of patients with limited stage FL. This is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-limited-stage-i-ii-follicular-lymphoma#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of limited stage (I/II) follicular lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Pretreatment evaluation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-and-diagnosis-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation and diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-staging-and-response-assessment-of-non-hodgkin-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation, staging, and response assessment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19675515\"><span class=\"h1\">ADVANCED STAGE DISEASE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26997747\"><span class=\"h2\">Therapeutic strategy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Advanced stage disease includes disease on both sides of the diaphragm (stage III) or diffuse involvement of one or more extralymphatic tissues (stage IV) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F97479\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97479 \">table 1</a>). Seventy to 85 percent of patients present with advanced stage disease. Survival rates vary and can be estimated for the population using the Follicular Lymphoma International Prognostic Index (FLIPI) score with five- and 10-year overall survival rates ranging from approximately 50 to 90 and 35 to 70 percent, respectively in the pre-rituximab era (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F55987\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55987 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>Patients with advanced stage disease are usually not cured with conventional treatment. While remissions can be attained, repeated relapses are common. Treatment focuses on the alleviation of symptoms, reversal of cytopenias, and improvement of quality of life. While not curative, modern therapy that incorporates <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> prolongs survival. (See <a href=\"#H19675536\" class=\"local\">'Immunotherapy-based treatment'</a> below.)</p><p>The treatment of patients with advanced stage FL varies widely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-advanced-stage-iii-iv-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Whenever available, patients should be encouraged to participate in clinical trials. Asymptomatic patients can be observed initially. Once therapy is indicated, immunotherapy-based treatment (eg, chemotherapy plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>) is preferred because it results in superior response rates, progression-free survival, and overall survival. Single agent rituximab may be considered for patients with comorbid conditions that make them poor candidates for chemotherapy. Single agent rituximab is also a reasonable alternative for those with a low tumor burden <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> disease that progresses slowly over years. Oral chemotherapy without rituximab (eg, low dose single agent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorambucil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorambucil</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>) may be used for the uncommon patient who cannot tolerate rituximab or who is not a candidate for more intensive intravenous chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-advanced-stage-iii-iv-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Local radiation can be administered for the palliation of locally symptomatic disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19675522\"><span class=\"h3\">Indications for treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As described above, patients with asymptomatic, stable FL do not require immediate treatment, but should be followed closely. The disease course is variable with some patients demonstrating stable disease for years and others progressing more rapidly. Rarely, patients may have spontaneous remissions lasting longer than one year. </p><p>Clinicians differ in the criteria that they use to initiate treatment. The two most commonly used systems are those proposed by the Groupe d-Etude des Lymphomes Folliculaires (GELF) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-advanced-stage-iii-iv-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] and the British National Lymphoma Investigation (BNLI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-advanced-stage-iii-iv-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Our approach, described below, incorporates factors of each.</p><p>The following findings are clear indications for treatment:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Local symptoms due to progressive or bulky nodal disease</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Compromise of normal organ function due to progressive or bulky disease</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence of systemic B symptoms (ie, fevers, weight loss, night sweats) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presence of symptomatic extranodal disease, such as effusions</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cytopenias due to extensive bone marrow infiltration, autoimmune hemolytic anemia or thrombocytopenia, or hypersplenism</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An increase in disease tempo</p><p/><p>These criteria are used as general indications for therapy because treatment of these factors is thought to improve quality of life. These are similar to the indications for therapy used in the trials comparing observation with initial therapy described in the previous section and most of the trials of chemotherapy for advanced stage disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19675529\"><span class=\"h3\">Asymptomatic patients</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several randomized trials comparing chemotherapy regimens of different intensities with a watch-and-wait strategy followed by chemotherapy at the time of progression support the use of an initial period of observation for asymptomatic patients with low volume disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-advanced-stage-iii-iv-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/4-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-10</a>]. This approach does not jeopardize survival, and a prolonged treatment-free period may decrease the potential for drug resistance by avoiding exposure of the tumor to chemotherapy. In contrast, a large international randomized trial comparing watchful waiting versus initial treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> suggested that initial treatment with rituximab may improve quality of life (ie, decrease anxiety) and postpone cytotoxic chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-advanced-stage-iii-iv-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p>In an international phase III trial, 379 patients with advanced-stage, asymptomatic, non-bulky FL were randomly assigned to initial management with one of three strategies: watchful waiting; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> induction (rituximab 375 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> weekly for four doses); or rituximab induction followed by maintenance rituximab (administered every two months for two years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-advanced-stage-iii-iv-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Poor accrual resulted in the early closure of the rituximab induction arm. Rituximab therapy was associated with improved ratings on quality of life measures, reflecting a decrease in anxiety. There was no difference in overall survival or rate of histologic transformation. There were 18 serious adverse events potentially related to rituximab therapy. As expected, watchful waiting resulted in a greater percentage of patients requiring subsequent interventions at three years (54 versus 12 and 22 percent). Surprisingly, the majority (91 percent) of patients in the watchful waiting group received chemotherapy upon progression, whereas four were treated with single-agent rituximab. </p><p>For asymptomatic, stable patients with advanced stage FL, we suggest initial observation. Immunotherapy-based treatment (eg, chemotherapy plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>) is reserved for disease progression. This preference is largely based upon the prospective trials that have demonstrated no difference in overall survival with deferred therapy and the avoidance of cost, complications, and potential drug resistance. Alternatively, patients seeking immediate treatment may choose initial therapy with rituximab alone. (See <a href=\"#H19675550\" class=\"local\">'Immunotherapy alone'</a> below.)</p><p>We follow asymptomatic patients in clinic every three months for the first year and then every three to six months thereafter until progressive disease is noted. At these appointments we perform a history, physical examination, and laboratory studies including a complete blood count with differential, chemistries with liver and renal function and electrolytes, and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). Imaging studies are repeated only if clinically indicated. Progressive disease is defined by an enlarging liver, spleen, or lymph node mass or by the development of new lesions, signs, or symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-advanced-stage-iii-iv-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>The progression of FL to the more aggressive variant diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) occurs regardless of whether FL is treated aggressively or conservatively, at a rate of approximately 3 percent per year, depending upon the magnitude of the large cell component. Histologic transformation should be suspected if there is a rapid progression of lymphadenopathy, infiltration of extranodal sites, the development of systemic symptoms, or an elevated serum LDH. Biopsy of a suspicious area is indicated in such circumstances. In addition, we have a low threshold for obtaining a biopsy for all patients with FL at the time of progression. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=histologic-transformation-of-follicular-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Histologic transformation of follicular lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19675536\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunotherapy-based treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies is a key component of the treatment of patients with FL; chemoimmunotherapy results in superior response rates, progression-free survival, and overall survival when compared to chemotherapy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-advanced-stage-iii-iv-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/13-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-19</a>]. The anti-CD20 antibody <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> was the first monoclonal antibody to be used successfully in FL. There are less data regarding the use of other anti-CD20 monoclonal antibodies (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obinutuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">obinutuzumab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ofatumumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ofatumumab</a>) in previously untreated FL, although results from one randomized trial suggest that obinutuzumab-based induction and maintenance prolongs progression-free survival over that seen with rituximab-based therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-advanced-stage-iii-iv-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2034764840\" class=\"local\">'Choice of anti-CD20 antibody'</a> below.)</p><p>Most studies have utilized intravenous administration. A subcutaneous formulation (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-and-hyaluronidase-subcutaneous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab-hyaluronidase</a>) that uses a fixed dose and a shorter administration time is an acceptable alternative for patients who have tolerated at least one full dose of intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-advanced-stage-iii-iv-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Randomized trials have demonstrated comparable efficacy and safety of the two formulations in patients with FL, diffuse large B cell lymphoma, and chronic lymphocytic leukemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-advanced-stage-iii-iv-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/22-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-25</a>].</p><p>The major toxicities of anti-CD20 antibodies include infusion reactions (ie, fevers, rigors, and hypotension) and infections related to immunosuppression. These agents also imposes a risk of hepatitis B reactivation among patients positive for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or antibodies against hepatitis B core antigen (anti-HBc).

It is not known whether this will translate into a survival benefit in the future and the use of either antibody is reasonable at this time. When considering the choice of anti-CD20 antibody, the potential toxicities and the value of PFS as a clinical endpoint must be interpreted within the context of the disease course. Patients with advanced stage FL are not cured with conventional therapies. Most of these patients are managed over decades with a focus on symptom control.

Maintenance rituximab was associated with a greater risk of adverse events, most commonly infections (34 versus 24 percent). On subset analysis, a survival benefit was <strong>not</strong> seen when maintenance rituximab was given after rituximab-containing induction. </p><p>It is not clear whether these results can be safely extrapolated to patients treated with other initial chemotherapy regimens, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bendamustine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bendamustine</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> (BR) or rituximab, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fludarabine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fludarabine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mitoxantrone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mitoxantrone</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> (R-FND). The universal applicability of rituximab maintenance was questioned by the results of a randomized phase III trial that evaluated the use of rituximab or observation after initial therapy with R-FND in 234 older adults (age 60 to 75 years) with previously untreated advanced stage FL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-advanced-stage-iii-iv-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. After induction, the overall response rate was 86 percent (69 percent complete). After a median follow-up of 42 months, the estimated rates of progression-free survival and overall survival at three years were 66 and 89 percent, respectively. Rituximab maintenance was associated with a trend towards improved progression-free survival at two years (81 versus 69 percent), which did not reach statistical significance, and a higher rate of severe (grade <span class=\"nowrap\">3/4)</span> neutropenia (14 versus 1 percent). Variation in the benefit from rituximab maintenance by induction regimen was also suggested on a subset analysis of the PRIMA trial, in which there didn't appear to be a benefit following rituximab, fludarabine, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a>, and mitoxantrone (R-FCM) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-treatment-of-advanced-stage-iii-iv-follicular-lymphoma/abstract/62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,63</a>]. As such, we do not advocate the use of rituximab maintenance after initial therapy with regimens other than R-CVP or R-CHOP. A subset of patients may select to proceed with maintenance after discussion of the potential harms and benefits.

After demonstrating response or disease stabilization at week 12 after four weekly doses of single agent rituximab, patients randomly assigned to continue with rituximab maintenance (every two months for four doses) had a significantly longer median event-free survival (24 versus 13 months) when compared with those randomized to observation. There was no apparent increase in toxicity, and those patients who had not received chemotherapy before had an even more pronounced improvement in median event-free survival with prolonged rituximab therapy (36 versus 19 months) when compared with observation.

Rituximab therapy was well tolerated with the maintenance arm receiving approximately three times as much rituximab than the observation arm (18 versus 4 doses).

Advanced stage FL is not curable with conventional treatment. Thus, in contrast to patients with curable aggressive lymphomas, the major indication for treatment is alleviation of symptoms and most patients with asymptomatic disease may defer therapy. (See <a href=\"#H19675522\" class=\"local\">'Indications for treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with previously untreated advanced stage FL who require therapy, we recommend treatment with an immunotherapy-based regimen rather than chemotherapy alone or hematopoietic cell transplantation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). A choice among the various regimens depends upon patient characteristics and physician comfort. While we generally prefer rituximab-based combinations, obinutuzumab-based regimens are an acceptable alternative. We suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bendamustine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bendamustine</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> (BR) rather than other regimens (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). This preference is based upon our experience with the regimen and the improved progression-free survival rates and less toxicity when compared with R-CHOP. R-CHOP may be preferred for fit patients with clinically more aggressive histologic grade 3a disease. R-CVP would be an acceptable alternative in patients who are not candidates for anthracyclines (eg, those with underlying cardiac disease). Single agent rituximab would be an acceptable alternative in patients with comorbid conditions that make them poor candidates for chemotherapy and for those with a low tumor burden <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> disease progressing slowly over years.
