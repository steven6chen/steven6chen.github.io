Normally, the small intestine's muscles squeeze to move air, fluid, and food through it. But in an ileus, the small intestine has trouble moving the air, fluid, and food along. These things then get stuck in the small intestine and cause symptoms. A postoperative ileus is when an ileus happens after surgery. It can happen in children or adults.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H281896451\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes a postoperative ileus?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Different things can cause a postoperative ileus, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A collection of blood in the belly or tissue in the region behind the intestines called the &quot;retroperitoneum&quot;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain medicines, especially strong pain medicines</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection, such as infections of the intestine or inside of the belly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not enough blood flow to the intestines</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H281896458\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of an ileus?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common symptoms are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Belly pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Belly swelling and bloating</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea and vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Not being able to have a bowel movement or pass gas</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H281896465\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Probably. Your doctor or nurse will ask about your symptoms and do an exam. To find out what's causing your ileus, he or she will probably do blood tests and imaging tests. Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p>The imaging tests can include an X-ray, CT scan, or a series of X-rays called a &quot;GI series.&quot; For the CT scan and GI series, you will drink a liquid called &quot;contrast&quot; beforehand. The contrast will show up on the CT scan or X-rays.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H281896472\"><span class=\"h1\">How is a postoperative ileus treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment depends on your symptoms and what's causing your ileus. All people with an ileus are treated in the hospital.</p><p>To treat your symptoms and help you feel better, your doctor can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Give you fluids and nutrition through an IV (a small tube that goes into your vein)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Put a thin tube called a &quot;nasogastric tube&quot; in your nose, down your esophagus, and into your stomach &ndash; The tube can suck up the fluid and air in your stomach. This will make your stomach feel better and help keep you from vomiting.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Give you medicine to help your intestine start working normally again</p><p/><p>Most people with a postoperative ileus get better in a few days.</p><p>If a medicine caused your ileus, your doctor will stop that medicine. He or she will also treat any other condition causing your ileus, if the condition can be treated.</p><p>People with an ileus do not usually need surgery. But they might if their problem is really because the intestines are blocked.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H281896531\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=small-bowel-obstruction-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Small bowel obstruction (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
