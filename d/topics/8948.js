Both GPA and MPA are associated with ANCA, have many identical clinical manifestations, have many similar histologic features, and have similar outcomes. There are, however, several differences between these disorders.

As an example, the Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score (BVAS) has been applied to patients with either GPA or MPA. The BVAS system incorporates data on disease manifestations in nine categories (ie, general symptoms such as arthralgia, arthritis, and fever, plus involvement of eight major organ systems) and has been the main outcome measurement tool used in clinical trials of antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibody (ANCA)-associated vasculitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-immunosuppressive-therapy-in-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Evaluation of patients using the BVAS system is mostly performed in research studies and less commonly in clinical practice.

The choice of therapy is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H3090256\" class=\"local\">'Overall approach to initial therapy'</a> below.)</p><p>Even patients with advanced renal disease, as assessed by serum creatinine concentration or the need for dialysis at presentation, may receive benefit from aggressive treatment. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of 155 patients with GPA or MPA and crescentic glomerulonephritis, 87 percent required hemodialysis at the time of kidney biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-immunosuppressive-therapy-in-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]; all patients were treated with immunosuppressive medications, usually with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> and glucocorticoids. At four months, 14 percent died, and 35 percent were alive but required dialysis; 51 percent did not require dialysis and had no evidence of active vasculitis. The likelihood of having improved renal function was lower if the biopsy showed a high degree of chronic damage, although some such patients did improve.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another report, remission was induced in 72 percent of 240 patients with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of &le;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, 68 percent of 188 patients with an eGFR of &le;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, and 57 percent of 96 patients with an eGFR of &le;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per 1.73 m<sup>2</sup> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-immunosuppressive-therapy-in-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p>Similarly, patients with longstanding upper or lower airway disease may benefit from initiation of immunosuppressive therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Definition of complete remission</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Induction of complete remission is the goal and expectation of treatment with immunosuppressive therapy in GPA or MPA and is defined as the absence of active disease (ie, the absence of any clinical manifestations that are deemed secondary to ongoing active vasculitis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-immunosuppressive-therapy-in-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis/abstract/4,7-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7-10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Renal remission</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If there is no active renal inflammation, then hematuria and, if present, red cell casts should remit. Remission is defined in such patients as less than 5 red cells per high-power field in a centrifuged urine sediment. Persistent hematuria should raise concern for ongoing glomerulonephritis. However, there are other potential causes of hematuria that can occur in patients with GPA or MPA that are unrelated to active renal inflammation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persistent hematuria at the time of apparent remission may reflect cyclophosphamide-induced cystitis. The red cells in this setting are typically isomorphic (normomorphic), not dysmorphic as with glomerular hematuria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F79440%7ENEPH%2F62064\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79440 graphicRef62064 \">picture 1A-B</a>), and cystoscopy usually shows signs of bladder injury (70 percent in one series) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-immunosuppressive-therapy-in-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

Persistent isomorphic hematuria raises the possibility of cyclophosphamide-induced bladder cancer, which is not typically seen with the usually short duration of therapy with cyclophosphamide now used in patients with GPA or MPA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-immunosuppressive-therapy-in-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

Short of bladder catheterization, the etiology of hematuria is best determined by repeat urinalysis after the cessation of menses.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persistent hematuria may be due to the coexistence of thin basement membrane disease. This usually benign condition is identified by kidney biopsy, and therefore, its presence should be known in patients who are treated for glomerulonephritis due to GPA or MPA. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thin-basement-membrane-nephropathy-benign-familial-hematuria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thin basement membrane nephropathy (benign familial hematuria)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonglomerular causes of hematuria, such as nephrolithiasis, urethral injury from catheterization, or infection (urethritis or cystitis), may also occur in patients with GPA or MPA.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Distinguishing active disease, irreversible injury, and treatment-related damage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important but sometimes difficult to differentiate evidence of active vasculitis from permanent damage, which can be due either to the underlying disease or to its treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-immunosuppressive-therapy-in-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Complete remission does <strong>not</strong> mean that all parameters have to return to baseline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-immunosuppressive-therapy-in-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Many patients have persistent abnormalities that reflect irreversible injury induced during the period of active inflammation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic upper airway mucosal damage with nasal crusting or a residual lung nodule (scar)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic but stable peripheral neuropathic sensory changes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persistent proteinuria and renal insufficiency</p><p/><p>As an example, a patient in whom systemic symptoms and signs resolve and the urinalysis becomes inactive (ie, no hematuria) is considered to be in remission, even if there is persistent proteinuria and persistent or even slowly worsening renal insufficiency. In addition, late progression of the renal disease can result from factors (eg, intraglomerular hypertension) that result from initial nephron loss rather than continuing disease activity. Angiotensin inhibition may be beneficial in such patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondary-factors-and-progression-of-chronic-kidney-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondary factors and progression of chronic kidney disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antihypertensive-therapy-and-progression-of-nondiabetic-chronic-kidney-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antihypertensive therapy and progression of nondiabetic chronic kidney disease in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Partial remission</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Partial remission is more difficult to define. In the kidney, partial remission refers to the persistence of dysmorphic (ie, glomerular) hematuria with or without red blood cell casts despite improvement in or stabilization of the serum creatinine and disappearance of extrarenal signs of active disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F79440%7ENEPH%2F62064\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef79440 graphicRef62064 \">picture 1A-B</a>). This is a smoldering process that can lead to progressive renal injury and usually indicates the need for further therapy. On the other hand, persistent proteinuria may reflect irreversible glomerular injury and, as an isolated finding, is not indicative of active disease.</p><p>Dysmorphic hematuria must be distinguished from isomorphic hematuria, which is characteristic of extraglomerular bleeding and, in patients receiving initial immunosuppressive therapy, may reflect cyclophosphamide-induced bladder toxicity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-evaluation-of-hematuria-in-adults#H1824471562\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and evaluation of hematuria in adults&quot;, section on 'Red cell morphology'</a>.)</p><p>Smoldering disease in the respiratory tract is a common and difficult problem. Active vasculitis in the upper respiratory tract must be distinguished from scarring, which can progress in the absence of active disease, and infection. Similarly, a nodule in the lung may represent active vasculitis, a scar, a malignancy in a patient treated with an alkylating agent, or an infection. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Distinguishing active disease, irreversible injury, and treatment-related damage'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">INITIAL THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial immunosuppressive therapy in granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) and microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) typically consists of glucocorticoids combined with either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F111371\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef111371 \">algorithm 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-immunosuppressive-therapy-in-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. Some studies have described the use of both cyclophosphamide and rituximab for initial therapy (rather than using one of these two agents), although this approach is controversial. Selected patients with severe disease may benefit from the addition of plasma exchange. (See <a href=\"#H1133277\" class=\"local\">'Role of plasma exchange'</a> below.)</p><p>The use of aggressive initial immunosuppression is justified because the mortality rate in untreated generalized GPA is as high as 90 percent at two years, usually due to respiratory or renal failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-immunosuppressive-therapy-in-granulomatosis-with-polyangiitis-and-microscopic-polyangiitis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].

Both GPA and MPA are associated with ANCA, have many identical clinical manifestations, have many similar histologic features, and have similar outcomes. Therapy for GPA and MPA has two main components: induction of remission with initial immunosuppressive therapy, and maintenance of remission with immunosuppressive therapy for a variable period to prevent relapse. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immunosuppressive therapy is warranted in almost all patients with active GPA or MPA. Induction of complete remission is the goal and expectation of treatment with immunosuppressive therapy in GPA or MPA and is defined as the absence of active disease (ie, the absence of any clinical manifestations that are deemed secondary to ongoing active vasculitis). It is important but sometimes difficult to differentiate evidence of active vasculitis from permanent damage, which can be due either to the underlying disease or to its treatment. Complete remission does <strong>not</strong> mean that all parameters have to return to baseline. Many patients have persistent abnormalities that reflect irreversible injury induced during the period of active inflammation, for example, chronic upper airway mucosal damage with nasal crusting or a residual lung nodule (scar), chronic but stable peripheral neuropathic sensory changes, and persistent proteinuria and renal insufficiency. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Initial immunosuppressive therapy in GPA and MPA typically consists of glucocorticoids combined with either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclophosphamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclophosphamide</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rituximab-intravenous-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rituximab</a>. Selected patients with severe disease may benefit from the addition of plasma exchange. The use of aggressive initial immunosuppression is justified because the mortality rate in untreated generalized GPA is as high as 90 percent at two years, usually due to respiratory or renal failure.
