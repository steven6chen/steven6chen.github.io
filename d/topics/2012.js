With the advent of the &quot;safety bicycle&quot; in the 1880s, bicycles became affordable, and bicycling became a national pastime. It is estimated that 44.3 million children and youth younger than 21 years ride bicycles in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Bicycles result in more childhood injuries than any other consumer product except the automobile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>This topic review will describe the epidemiology of bicycle injuries, review strategies for prevention of bicycle injuries in children, and define the clinician's role in bicycle safety. General principles of injury prevention are discussed separately.

A pedal cycle includes a bicycle, unicycle, or tricycle. Toys that a child straddles and propels with his or her feet are not pedal cycles and will not be discussed in this topic review.</p><p>A pedal cyclist is any person riding on a pedal cycle or riding in an attachment to such a vehicle. Although pedal cycle is the common language used in injury surveillance and reporting, the word &quot;bicycle&quot; will be used in this report unless specified otherwise.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Epidemiology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2015, 195,651 children &le;19 years of age sustained injuries associated with bicycles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Children between the ages of 5 and 14 years are at the highest risk for bicycle injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/2,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,6</a>]. Bicycle injuries in children typically are caused by falls or collision with a fixed or moving object. Serious injuries and fatalities are usually caused by collisions with motor vehicles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. Bicycle riding accounts for approximately 6 percent of fatal injuries and 5 percent of nonfatal injuries sustained during transportation to or from school [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>In 2015, there were 75 bicycle-associated deaths among children &le;19 years of age in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Children between 10 and 15 years of age have the highest death rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/7,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,11,12</a>]. The majority of bicycle-related deaths (85 percent) occur in boys [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Among children younger than 14 years of age, most bicycle fatalities are associated with the bicyclist's behavior (eg, not following the rules of the road: riding against the flow of traffic, riding into the street without stopping, etc) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Types of injuries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bicycle-related soft-tissue injuries, fractures, abdominal injury, and traumatic brain injury are common causes of emergency department visits and hospitalizations in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. In a review of 5420 emergency department visits for bicycle-related facial trauma in children and adolescents (72 percent boys), lacerations (63 percent), <span class=\"nowrap\">abrasions/contusions</span> (27 percent), and fractures (7 percent) were most common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Lacerations and abrasions were more common in children younger than 11 years, whereas fractures were more common in older children.</p><p>Traumatic brain injury is the leading cause of death and long-term disability in bicycle crashes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/8,18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,18-21</a>]. An estimated 140,000 children are treated each year in emergency departments in the United States for traumatic brain injuries sustained while riding bicycles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>In addition to head injuries, injuries to the musculoskeletal system and internal organs are important causes of bicycle-related morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In 1997, handlebar injuries to the abdominal or pelvic organs led to the hospitalization of an estimated 1147 subjects &le;19 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Young children who ride in bicycle-mounted seats are also at risk for injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Feet, legs, or clothing can get caught in the spokes of the bicycle wheel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. In addition, the added weight may make it more difficult for parents to control the bicycle or stop in time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. When falls occur, children in bicycle-mounted seats are exposed to adult-level forces of speed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Bike trailers are hitched and towed behind the parent and should not be used by infants. Likewise, the &quot;trail-a-bike,&quot; which converts an adult bicycle into a three-wheel tandem, should not be used by children younger than three years of age. Both of these products reduce the impact of forces from collisions related to height. However, injury data have not been studied, and these items have other safety issues related to product failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Socioeconomic impact</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The annual cost of traffic-related bicyclist death and injury for children &le;14 years is $2.4 billion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In 2003, bicycle-related injuries in children resulted in an estimated $200 million in total hospital costs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In the same year, handlebar injuries to the abdominal or pelvic organs among children &le;19 years of age resulted in an estimated total hospital cost of $10 million [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Bicycle helmets, discussed below, are the single most effective measure for the prevention of significant bicycle injury. Among injury prevention interventions, child bicycle helmets have one of the highest cost-benefit ratios [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. Assuming an 85 percent use rate, the average bicycle helmet can save an estimated $440 over 5 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. According to the Children's Safety Network, every $10 bike helmet generates $570 in benefits to society [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Age between 10 and 15 years and male sex are associated with increased bicycle injury mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/7,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,11,12</a>]. Other factors associated with bicycle injury in children and adolescents, described in observational studies, include nondaylight riding (eg, at dawn, dusk, or night), more frequent riding (eg, &gt;3 hours per week), riding on the road, riding on the sidewalk, and riding in rural areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/34-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-41</a>]. Some studies identify using the bicycle for play rather than transportation as a risk factor for bicycle injury, but the association is inconsistent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION OF BICYCLE-RELATED INJURIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As with most other injury prevention programs, research continues to support a combination or layering of multiple interventions as the best approach in increasing bicycle safety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/42-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-45</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pediatric-injury-prevention-epidemiology-history-and-application#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pediatric injury prevention: Epidemiology, history, and application&quot;, section on 'Principles of injury prevention and control'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Bicycle helmet use</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because head injuries account for the majority of bicycle-related deaths and hospital admissions, wearing a bicycle helmet is the first rule of bicycle safety. Multiple studies have shown that the use of a bicycle helmet reduces the risk of brain injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/46-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">46-55</a>]. A 2009 systematic review of five case-control studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/47-50,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-50,52</a>] found that helmets provide a 63 to 88 percent reduction in the risk of head, brain, and severe brain injuries and a 65 percent reduction of injuries to the upper and mid-face for bicyclists of all ages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Helmets provide similar protection for crashes involving motor vehicles and other causes (approximately 70 percent). In the only included study that was limited to children (&lt;15 years of age), wearing a helmet reduced the risk of head injury by 63 percent and of loss of consciousness by 86 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p>Bicycle helmet use has increased significantly with the advent of bicycle helmet laws [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/56-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">56-61</a>] and strict enforcement of the legislation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Survey data indicate bicycle helmet use is also influenced by parental rules and the age and attitudes of the children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>]. In a telephone survey, injury prevention counseling was associated with an increase in &quot;always wearing a helmet&quot; in 5- to 14-year-olds (58 versus 44 percent in those who did not receive counseling) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].</p><p>Even if they have a helmet, many children do not wear it every time they ride [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. Parents and children provide different reasons for lack of helmet use. Reasons provided by parents include lack of knowledge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/67,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">67,68</a>] and cost of the helmet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/42,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">42,69</a>]. Reasons provided by children include that they don't own a helmet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>], helmets are uncool and not used by their friends [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], helmets are uncomfortable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/38,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,70</a>] or inconvenient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>], and that helmets are not needed (eg, for casual riding, in contrast to sport or race bicycling) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/45,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,71</a>].</p><p>Although it is increasing, helmet use among teenagers is particularly low. In the 2015 Youth Risk Behavior Survey, among the 68 percent of high school students who reported riding a bicycle in the previous 12 months, 81 percent reported that they rarely or never wore a helmet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. The prevalence of never or rarely wearing a helmet declined from 96 to 81 percent between 1991 and 2015 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. In another survey, only 3 percent of 14- to 15-year-olds reported helmet use, whereas 80 percent of 12- to 13-year-olds reported wearing helmets when they were younger [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. Because of these dismal findings, the American Association of Pediatrics and other groups (eg, the National Safe Kids Campaign and Healthy People 2020) have called for increased efforts to promote bicycle helmet usage among adolescents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/73-75\" class=\"abstract_t\">73-75</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Helmet specifications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The United States Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) has established federal safety standards for all bicycle helmets sold in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. These standards replace the voluntary standards established by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI), the Snell Memorial Foundation, and the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM). Helmets that meet the CPSC standards have a CPSC sticker on the inside liner. Improvements in helmet design have led to the manufacture of rounder, more compact bike helmets with more foam and fewer air vents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].</p><p>Older helmets certified by the ASTM <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the Snell Memorial Foundation may continue to be used, but helmets certified only by the ANSI should be discarded (they were not tested at the contemporary standard) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/73,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">73,75</a>]. Multisport helmets, designed to be worn for several wheeled recreational activities including bicycling, must be certified to meet the CPSC standard for bicycle helmets.</p><p>In addition, helmets that have been in a crash in which the head has hit a hard surface or in which a fall has resulted in marks on the shell should be discarded immediately [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/73,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">73,75</a>].

In a study of helmet fit and risk of head injury, children who wore poorly fitting helmets had nearly two times the risk of head injury in a crash compared with children who wore properly fitted helmets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. In addition, children who wore the helmet tipped posteriorly had a 52 percent increase in the risk of head injury during a crash compared with children who wore the helmet centered on their heads [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>].</p><p>Children and parents may benefit from review of proper helmet fit and positioning. In one study of children aged 4 to 18 years presenting for a health maintenance visit, 96 percent of children and adolescents wore helmets that were either in unsatisfactory condition or did not fit properly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].</p><p>To help parents properly fit their children's helmets, the Bicycle Helmet Safety Institute developed the <a href=\"https://helmets.org/fit.htm&amp;token=X+8W7wCL+gpRENdpfe7NVWHiQPefVmlPq0YLtvKj7kP/AaqHXYaWfnEUJU/mO46/&amp;TOPIC_ID=2859\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">following guidelines</a>:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The helmet should rest just above the eyebrows and not slide around on the head (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F80155\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80155 \">figure 1</a>).

Of the three, legislation has achieved the greatest increase in bicycle helmet use. Multiple studies have demonstrated not only an increase in the use of bicycle helmets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/57,58,80\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58,80</a>], but also a decrease in serious head injuries and fatalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/59,81-84\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,81-84</a>] following the passage of bicycle helmet laws.</p><p>Awareness or education programs in the school <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> community [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/85-88\" class=\"abstract_t\">85-88</a>] and by clinicians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/69,89\" class=\"abstract_t\">69,89</a>] have also led to increases in the use of bicycle helmets. A systematic review of nonlegislative interventions for the promotion of helmet wearing by children found an increase in observed helmet wearing after educational programs, particularly those that were community based and provided free helmets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>].</p><p>Giveaway programs, although initially successful, have not been found to have a sustained effect in increasing the use of bicycle helmets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/62,90\" class=\"abstract_t\">62,90</a>]. In one giveaway program, researchers recommended a co-pay as a way to increase the number of helmets available to give to low-income families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Bicycle paths</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because the majority of serious bicycle injuries and fatalities are usually caused by collisions with motor vehicles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>], it makes sense to try to separate young recreational cyclists from motor vehicle traffic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/92,93\" class=\"abstract_t\">92,93</a>].

Although the benefits of bicycle lanes and bicycle paths have yet to be proven conclusively, evidence suggests that an increase in dedicated bike lanes increases the number of cyclists, which in turn reduces the number of bicycle injuries due to greater visibility and awareness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/95-98\" class=\"abstract_t\">95-98</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICIAN'S ROLE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Health care providers play an important role in increasing the use of bicycle helmets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/73,75,99,100\" class=\"abstract_t\">73,75,99,100</a>].

The carrier should be securely mounted and should have a spoke guard to protect the child's hands and feet; the seat should have a high back and a shoulder harness and lap belt that would adequately support a sleeping child; the child should never be left alone in the bicycle carrier [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>]. Mounted-carrier riding becomes less safe as the child approaches the age of four years and his or her weight makes the bicycle unstable and difficult to handle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>]. Bicycle-towed trailers are a safer alternative to bicycle-mounted child seats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The trailer provides greater stability, is out of reach of the spokes, and is lower to the ground in the event of a fall. All child passengers should wear an appropriately sized and properly fastened helmet (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F80155\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80155 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/73,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">73,75</a>].</p><p>A child should not be allowed to ride a tricycle or bicycle until he or she is developmentally ready [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/105\" class=\"abstract_t\">105</a>]. In general, children younger than three years do not have the cognitive or physical ability to both pedal and steer. According to the United States Consumer Product Safety Commission's Age Determination Guidelines, a tricycle should have wheels that are 12 to 13 inches in diameter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>]. Three-year-old children may be able to use a small bicycle with training wheels, but because children of this age cannot yet use hand brakes, the bicycle should have foot brakes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>].</p><p>Training wheels can facilitate the transition from tricycle to bicycle.</p><p>The first bicycle should be of an appropriate size for the child. Parents should be discouraged from buying a &quot;bigger bicycle&quot; with the hopes a child will grow into it. To fit properly, a child should be able to sit on the seat and put the balls of both feet on the ground while holding the handlebars. To prevent straddle injuries, the child should have a one-inch clearance between the bar and the crotch when he or she straddles the bicycle and has both feet on the ground [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/107\" class=\"abstract_t\">107</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=straddle-injuries-in-children-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Straddle injuries in children: Evaluation and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>By five years of age, most children have the balance and coordination to ride bicycles with training wheels and foot brakes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>]. However, they do not understand the risks of riding in areas with cars and should be taught to ride only in areas away from motorists (eg, parks or playgrounds) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/108\" class=\"abstract_t\">108</a>]. Basic bicycle skills include learning how to use the brakes to stop and how to look left, right, and left again. Children should also practice the quick shoulder check by glancing behind while proceeding forward in a straight line. Once the basics are mastered, parents should instruct young children to ride on the sidewalk, avoid the street, and only to ride when accompanied by an adult.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h3\">Children 6 to 12 years</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>By the age of six years, most children are able to ride a bicycle without training wheels and have developed some understanding of the consequences of riding in areas shared by cars and pedestrians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>]. Foot brakes on bicycles should be used until the child has developed the motor coordination to use hand brakes (usually by six years of age) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bicycle-injuries-in-children-prevention/abstract/106\" class=\"abstract_t\">106</a>]. As for younger children, the bicycle should be of an appropriate size for the child. To fit properly, a child should be able to sit on the seat and put the balls of both feet on the ground while holding the handlebars. The purchase of bicycle that the child can &quot;grow into&quot; should be discouraged. <a href=\"http://patiented.aap.org/categoryBrowse.aspx?catID=27&amp;token=RS2415TW3Qmo+d+ZyDA9MwENi0VKLCDNU+togdKoi9gODR3/v0cfVLr6TJslsJL0kxSCm9BxRa3vQC0jt1PCjg==&amp;TOPIC_ID=2859\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">The Injury Prevention Program</a> (TIPP) of the AAP provides information to help parents teach young children bicycle safety.</p><p>School-age children have the motor skills to become accomplished bike riders.
