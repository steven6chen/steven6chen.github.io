It is imperative for the trauma provider to use normative values for children as opposed to adults when assessing vital signs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F78097\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78097 \">table 1</a>) (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-blood-pressure-percentiles-for-girls-0-to-17-years-old-revised-2017\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-blood-pressure-percentiles-for-boys-0-to-17-years-old-revised-2017\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trauma-management-unique-pediatric-considerations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trauma management: Unique pediatric considerations&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Many seriously injured children, who ultimately require hospitalization <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> surgical intervention, initially appear stable. It is incumbent on the emergency provider to thoroughly evaluate initially stable appearing traumatized children and to identify those at high risk for serious injury based on mechanism and physical findings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F60424\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60424 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F57293\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57293 \">table 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H425775666\"><span class=\"h2\">Injury classification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Traumatic injuries can range from minor to life-threatening. Several methods for measuring severity of injury exist. In order to appropriately triage the management of the trauma patient, one useful method to categorize injuries uses the following parameters (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-trauma-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of trauma in children&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Injury extent</strong> &ndash; Multiple trauma is defined by apparent injury to two or more body areas. Localized trauma involves only one anatomic region (eg, head and neck, chest and back, abdomen, extremities) of the body. Sometimes the extent of injury may be obvious; at other times this may not be readily apparent, and the clinical picture may evolve over time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Injury type</strong> &ndash; The expected injuries differ based on whether they occur as a result of blunt trauma (eg, fall, motor vehicle collision [MVC]) or penetrating trauma (eg, gunshot, stabbing, or shrapnel from explosion).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Injury severity</strong> &ndash; The mechanism of injury and physical examination findings are useful in the determination of severity. Assessment of severity will dictate the initial management and disposition of the injured child [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-initially-stable-child-with-blunt-or-penetrating-injury/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. High-risk trauma mechanisms predict patients who are more likely to be unstable or become unstable and, along with vital signs and physical findings, are often used to guide prehospital transport decisions and to initiate evaluation by a trauma team in hospital trauma centers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F60424\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60424 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F57293\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57293 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F57153\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57153 \">table 4</a>).

When blunt force is applied to a child's small body, multisystem trauma occurs frequently. However, the majority of injuries are mild to moderate in severity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial evaluation of the pediatric patient with a history of mild or moderate blunt trauma begins with the primary and secondary surveys (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F64241\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64241 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F65952\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65952 \">table 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-initially-stable-child-with-blunt-or-penetrating-injury/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The stable pediatric trauma patient should have a normal primary survey with the possible exception of tachycardia caused by age-appropriate anxiety and crying or mild lethargy (Glasgow coma scale &ge;14) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59662\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59662 \">table 6</a>).</p><p>During the secondary survey, the emergency provider determines the injury extent (multiple trauma or isolated trauma), injury type (blunt or penetrating), and injury severity based on all physical findings.</p><p>The primary and secondary surveys may be truncated in the setting of trivial trauma or obviously isolated trauma (eg, struck on the knee by a baseball, twisted ankle, or fall on an outstretched arm). All other children should undergo a complete physical examination to ensure that subtle findings of significant injury are not missed.</p><p>Based on the initial brief history and physical assessment, injuries in each anatomic region in children with blunt trauma can be classified as mild (eg, isolated bruise), moderate (eg, head trauma with loss of consciousness), or severe (eg, liver laceration after blunt trauma) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F57153\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57153 \">table 4</a>). The severity of injuries may be estimated as a guide to management. This preliminary estimate is based upon the amount of force and mechanism of injury, the physical examination findings, including the vital signs, and evidence of superficial versus internal injuries. Further diagnostic evaluation depends upon the clinical assessment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H165891447\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach by injury location</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3739419866\"><span class=\"h3\">Head trauma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most children evaluated in the emergency department (ED) for blunt head trauma have sustained a minor injury and require no further intervention. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minor-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children-evaluation#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Minor head trauma in infants and children: Evaluation&quot;, section on 'Incidence of brain injury'</a>.)</p><p>A clinical decision rule identifying those at low risk of clinically important traumatic brain injury has been derived and validated in a large, multicenter cohort and is shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F58477\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58477 \">table 7</a>). Low-risk patients who do not undergo neuroimaging should meet all of these criteria. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minor-head-trauma-in-infants-and-children-evaluation#H1236231\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Minor head trauma in infants and children: Evaluation&quot;, section on 'Clinical decision rules'</a>.)</p><p>The approach to neuroimaging for stable infants and children with minor head trauma who do <strong>not</strong> meet low-risk criteria for significant traumatic brain injury and further discussion of clinical decision rules are provided separately.

For the few patients with clinically important traumatic brain injury, specific management is determined by the type of injury. Prompt neurosurgical consultation should be obtained in the patients with the following clinically important traumatic brain injuries (ciTBI) or skull fractures:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Parenchymal brain injury or intracranial hemorrhage detected by computed tomography (CT) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intracranial-subdural-hematoma-in-children-clinical-features-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intracranial subdural hematoma in children: Clinical features, evaluation, and management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intracranial-epidural-hematoma-in-children-clinical-features-diagnosis-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intracranial epidural hematoma in children: Clinical features, diagnosis, and management&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depressed, basilar, or widely diastatic skull fracture (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=skull-fractures-in-children-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Skull fractures in children: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;, section on 'Basilar skull fractures'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=skull-fractures-in-children-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Skull fractures in children: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;, section on 'Depressed skull fractures'</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deteriorating clinical condition (eg, Glasgow coma scale &le;13 or rapidly decreasing) regardless of neuroimaging results (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=severe-traumatic-brain-injury-in-children-initial-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Severe traumatic brain injury in children: Initial evaluation and management&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p>Otherwise, almost all infants and children who have had isolated minor head trauma can be safely discharged following evaluation. Observation is still important even in discharged patients because signs and symptoms of traumatic brain injury may arise and warrant prompt return to the ED for reevaluation. Thus, clear instructions should be provided and the presence of responsible caretakers who can return in a timely manner, if necessary, should be assured. The clinician should also determine, based upon the clinical scenario (eg, age and symptoms of child, time since injury, time of day, home distance from hospital, and perceived quality of caregiver observation), whether emergency department or hospital observation is necessary and, if it is necessary, how long observation should last.

Patients with these findings warrant additional evaluation for potential life-threatening thoracic injury (eg, pulmonary contusion, cardiac contusion, and pneumothorax) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F59720\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef59720 \">algorithm 3</a>).

Repeated assessments are helpful to identify developing intraabdominal injuries over time when the mechanism of injury is concerning, particularly with perforations of the bowel as seen in lap belt injuries.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Mechanism of injury</strong> &ndash; Mechanisms of trauma that are associated with intraabdominal injury include high speed motor vehicle collision (MVC), especially without restraint or with seat belt but not shoulder strap usage, and falls from a height greater than 20 feet (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F57293\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57293 \">table 3</a>). However, serious intraabdominal injury, especially splenic laceration or hematoma, can occur with seemingly trivial abdominal trauma to the left upper quadrant. For this reason, even abdominal trauma sustained as a result of minimal force (eg, a two-year-old struck by a ball) requires a thorough physical examination.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Additional findings</strong> &ndash; A clinical decision rule for the identification of children at very low risk for intra-abdominal (IAI) blunt injuries requiring acute intervention, defined as intra-abdominal injury associated with death, therapeutic intervention at laparotomy, angiographic embolization, blood transfusion for anemia, or intravenous fluids for &gt;2 nights has identified the following predictors of those at low risk (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-children#H15379371\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of blunt abdominal trauma in children&quot;, section on 'Low-risk rule for intraabdominal injury'</a>):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Glasgow coma scale &ge;14</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>No evidence of abdominal wall trauma or seat belt sign</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>No abdominal tenderness</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>No complaints of abdominal pain</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>No vomiting</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>No thoracic wall trauma</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>No decreased breath sounds</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients who meet all criteria have an approximately 0.1 percent risk of an IAI and typically do <strong>not</strong> warrant extensive laboratory testing or abdominal CT. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-children#H15379371\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of blunt abdominal trauma in children&quot;, section on 'Low-risk rule for intraabdominal injury'</a>.)</p><p/><p>Potential indications for laboratory evaluation and abdominal CT in children who do not meet these criteria or have other concerning findings after sustaining blunt abdominal trauma are discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-children#H1500169994\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of blunt abdominal trauma in children&quot;, section on 'Approach'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-children#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of blunt abdominal trauma in children&quot;, section on 'Abdominal and pelvic CT'</a>.)</p><p>Focused assessment with sonography for trauma (FAST) is a rapid ultrasound examination of four abdominal locations (right upper quadrant, left upper quadrant, subxiphoid region, and pelvis). Use of FAST in children with a clinical impression of low risk for IAI after initial evaluation does <strong>not</strong> appear to improve clinical outcomes and has low sensitivity for IAI when compared with abdominal CT. In the stable patient, the presence of intraperitoneal fluid on FAST typically indicates hemorrhage secondary to an intra-abdominal organ injury that should be examined further by an abdominal CT with intravenous contrast. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trauma-management-approach-to-the-unstable-child#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trauma management: Approach to the unstable child&quot;, section on 'FAST (Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma)'</a>.)</p><p>However, observational evidence suggests that a negative FAST combined with normal liver transaminase values (alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase) may achieve adequate sensitivity to permit observation instead of abdominal CT, especially in children judged to be at low risk for intra-abdominal injury, although further study is needed. As an example, in a retrospective registry study of 400 pediatric trauma patients who had liver transaminases, FAST, and abdominal CT, combining FAST and liver enzyme results significantly increased sensitivity and specificity over FAST alone (50 versus 88 percent for sensitivity and 91 versus 98 percent for specificity) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-initially-stable-child-with-blunt-or-penetrating-injury/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Pelvic radiographs add little to the evaluation and are not recommended in alert and hemodynamically stable patients unless the physical examination reveals pelvic tenderness <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> instability or the urinalysis shows hematuria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-initially-stable-child-with-blunt-or-penetrating-injury/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Abdominal CT with intravenous contrast is the preferred imaging modality for the definitive evaluation of blunt abdominal trauma in hemodynamically stable children. CT is sensitive and specific in diagnosing liver, spleen, and retroperitoneal injuries. CT is less sensitive in detecting injuries of the pancreas, intestinal tract, bladder, and lumbar spine. Based upon a systematic review of observational studies that reported outcomes on over 9000 children, asymptomatic children with a negative abdominal CT are very unlikely to have intraabdominal injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-initially-stable-child-with-blunt-or-penetrating-injury/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Caregivers of children with a normal abdominal CT who are being discharged home should be instructed to seek medical care if the child develops worsening abdominal pain or vomiting, which has the potential to occur subacutely with intestinal tract injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/approach-to-the-initially-stable-child-with-blunt-or-penetrating-injury/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Thoracic trauma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Intraabdominal injuries caused by blunt abdominal trauma must be suspected from historical information, particularly the mechanism of injury (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F57293\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57293 \">table 3</a>), and careful physical examination. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Abdominal trauma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Low energy trauma to the extremities often requires radiographic examination for possible fracture, especially physeal fractures in children. A normal radiograph does not exclude a Salter-Harris type I fracture of the growth plate, which may be diagnosed based upon focal tenderness at the physis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54582\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54582 \">figure 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Extremity trauma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The approach to penetrating trauma is similar to blunt trauma although trauma requiring operative care is more likely. In the stable patient, the severity of the injury is primarily determined by the characteristics of the weapon and the location of the wound or wounds. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Initial evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H165891667\" class=\"local\">'Approach by injury location'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If there is any concern for penetration into the cranial vault (eg, moderate to high velocity gunshot wound to the head or deep dog bite), imaging is required and wounds more likely to penetrate the calvarium, such as gunshots, warrant neurosurgical consultation. Unenhanced computed tomography of the head provides the most detailed information. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Head trauma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with injuries penetrating the platysma, pleura, peritoneum, or spinal canal or causing neurovascular deficit in an extremity require stabilization and emergency surgical consultation. Evaluation and management of penetrating injuries of the neck through the platysma are provided in the algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F51111\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef51111 \">algorithm 5</a>).
