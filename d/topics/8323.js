At the end of the 19th century, hospices were designated specifically to care for the dying, first in Ireland and later in England. St. Christopher&rsquo;s Hospice in London opened in 1967 under the direction of Dr. Cicely Saunders. A nurse, social worker, and a physician, Saunders developed and advanced the modern hospice movement to reflect her commitment to patient-centered care, pain management, research, and education. The philosophy and practice of the St. Christopher&rsquo;s Hospice program has since spread to all countries in the developed world and to many developing countries.</p><p>Hospice services are designed to provide comprehensive interdisciplinary team-based palliative care for patients with life-limiting illness and a prognosis of six months or less if the disease follows its natural course. Hospice services in the United States (US) are an insurance benefit reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid, and other payers. </p><p>In the US, hospice was initially a grass roots and volunteer response to bring attention to the needs of the dying, with the goal of providing patient-centered care and avoiding unnecessary medical intervention. In 1982, the Medicare hospice benefit was authorized under part A of the Medicare program [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospice-philosophy-of-care-and-appropriate-utilization-in-the-united-states/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The past two decades have seen a dramatic increase in the number of hospice programs internationally and within the US. For example, in the US [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospice-philosophy-of-care-and-appropriate-utilization-in-the-united-states/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As of 2014, there were 6100 hospice programs serving an estimated 1.6 to 1.7 million Americans yearly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospice-philosophy-of-care-and-appropriate-utilization-in-the-united-states/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In 2009, over 40 percent of Medicare decedents utilized hospice at some point in their care, an increase from 23 percent in 2000. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 41.9 percent of all deaths in the US in 2010 were under the care of a hospice program. This reflects a change from 1 in 12 deaths of Medicare beneficiaries in 1992 to two in five deaths in 2009 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospice-philosophy-of-care-and-appropriate-utilization-in-the-united-states/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p>Hospice programs are currently located in all 50 states, as well as the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Guam, and the US Virgin Islands, further illustrating the growth of hospice care nationwide. Hospices range in size with 16.6 percent caring for fewer than 50 patients yearly, 28 percent caring for 50 to 150 patients yearly, 34 percent caring for 151 to 500 patients yearly, 17 percent caring for between 501 and 1500 patients, and 5 percent caring for greater than 1500 patients yearly. Hospice programs also differ in tax status category. In 2014, the majority of hospice programs were for profit agencies (68 percent), with not-for profit hospices making up 28 percent of programs, and government owned programs making up 4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospice-philosophy-of-care-and-appropriate-utilization-in-the-united-states/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. &#160;</p><p>In tandem with the maturing of the hospice movement and aging of the population, the patterns of diagnosis among patients receiving hospice care have changed. For example, in the US, death from cancer accounted for 53 percent of hospice patients in the 1990s whereas in 2014, only 37 percent of hospice patients had cancer and 6 percent died from other chronic debilitating diseases (such as dementia, heart disease, lung disease, and stroke) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospice-philosophy-of-care-and-appropriate-utilization-in-the-united-states/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. These shifts in diagnoses reflect the correlation of hospice utilization with changes in the leading causes of death (cancer accounted for fewer than 25 percent of deaths in the US in 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospice-philosophy-of-care-and-appropriate-utilization-in-the-united-states/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]). </p><p>Despite the rapid growth of hospice care in the US and elsewhere, significant gaps remain in the delivery of services for patients and families with life limiting illnesses who may not meet the hospice eligibility criteria. For example, the Institute of Medicine in the US released a report on care near the end of life, in which they acknowledged that as society has become culturally more diverse, the need for patient centered care has never been more relevant. Unfortunately, the fragmented US healthcare system and the shortage of palliative care trained professionals contribute to the problems of caring for those with serious, complex, and debilitating illness who may not be hospice-eligible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospice-philosophy-of-care-and-appropriate-utilization-in-the-united-states/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H691104\" class=\"local\">'Eligibility'</a> below.)</p><p>This topic will discuss the hospice model of care and utilization of hospice programs and will draw specifically on the experience in the US. An overview of palliative care services in the US and a separate discussion of palliative care from an international perspective are presented separately.

The hospice philosophy embraces the general principle of a comfortable death with dignity. The care and treatment provided are based on the patient&rsquo;s and family&rsquo;s goals and values. </p><p>The key concept of hospice identifies that suffering in the dying patient derives from a combination of symptoms and impairments that disrupt physical, psychological, spiritual, and social equilibrium, which Cecily Saunders referred to as &ldquo;total pain&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospice-philosophy-of-care-and-appropriate-utilization-in-the-united-states/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The hospice model is one of interdisciplinary team care that provides comprehensive care addressing all aspects of suffering [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospice-philosophy-of-care-and-appropriate-utilization-in-the-united-states/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Patients facing unrelieved suffering experience demoralization and existential angst (questioning the meaning of life, loss of freedom, loss of identity and dignity, grief, and fear of dying); these consequences of suffering must be addressed in the context of care provided by the physician and the hospice interdisciplinary team [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospice-philosophy-of-care-and-appropriate-utilization-in-the-united-states/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. &#160;</p><p>The interdisciplinary hospice team is available to provide services, either directly or by phone accessibility, seven days per week and 24 hours per day. Hospice care is most often provided in the patient&rsquo;s place of residence (private home, 35.7 percent; nursing home, 14.5 percent; or residential living facility, 8.7 percent), but can also be provided in a dedicated facility such as a hospice inpatient facility (in which 32 percent of hospice-enrolled patients died in 2014) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospice-philosophy-of-care-and-appropriate-utilization-in-the-united-states/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In the most recent data from the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization (NHPCO), only 9.3 percent of hospice patients died in an acute care hospital, but this was an increase since 2013 (7 percent). (See <a href=\"#H51426077\" class=\"local\">'The hospice interdisciplinary team'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H103949484\"><span class=\"h2\">Distinction between hospice and palliative care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The specialty of palliative medicine arose as a direct result of the hospice movement. Palliative medicine incorporates the holistic care developed by hospice, focusing on symptom management, supporting and assisting with communication, and providing such care to a wider group of patients including those who are not dying or who cannot receive or choose not to receive hospice services. While all care that is delivered by hospices can be considered palliative care, not all palliative care is delivered in hospices.</p><p>Palliative care aims to relieve suffering in all stages of disease and is not limited to end of life care. Within an integrated model of medical care, palliative care is provided at the same time as curative or life-prolonging disease treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospice-philosophy-of-care-and-appropriate-utilization-in-the-united-states/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In contrast, hospice is palliative care specifically offered to patients at the end of life when curative or life-prolonging therapy is no longer beneficial or when its burdens outweigh its benefits.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H51426077\"><span class=\"h2\">The hospice interdisciplinary team</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hospice is provided by specially trained clinicians and support staff whose goals are to ensure that patients and their families are cared for during what can be a very difficult time. This interdisciplinary team can include any of the following: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Registered Hospice nurse - The registered nurse is the primary case manager and is responsible for skilled nursing care and coordination of other members of the interdisciplinary team. Hospice nurses, who are ideally certified (eg, in hospice and palliative care in the United States) visit patients regularly, from daily to weekly based on need.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hospice physician - The hospice physician plays both a medical and administrative role and is ideally board-certified in the specialty of Hospice and Palliative Medicine. Some hospice physicians visit patients at home, particularly if the patient does not have an involved attending physician. In addition, the hospice physician acts as a liaison to the attending clinicians and can assist with symptom management.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary attending physician - Although the primary attending (and often the referring) physician is encouraged to remain involved in the care of patients after referral to hospice, often this does not occur. The primary attending physician may work directly with the hospice nurse and also in collaboration with the hospice medical director to monitor symptoms and order interventions such as medications or skilled nursing care. Physicians not employed by the hospice may bill fee for service for their care of their patients within the hospice program [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospice-philosophy-of-care-and-appropriate-utilization-in-the-united-states/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. &#160; </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Social worker - The social worker provides psychosocial (eg, housing, nutrition, transportation, and family caregiver support) support for patients and families, including counseling, bereavement support, <span class=\"nowrap\">burial/funeral</span> planning, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> referrals to other support systems.

Spiritual care is offered to patients with both structured and unstructured religious beliefs. For patients with a structured religious background, chaplains can act as liaisons to clergy or other religious figures.

Additionally, two systematic reviews provide guidance for identifying patients with end stage illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospice-philosophy-of-care-and-appropriate-utilization-in-the-united-states/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. The systematic reviews have identified patient presentations associated with median survival of six months or less for patients with cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospice-philosophy-of-care-and-appropriate-utilization-in-the-united-states/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>] or six noncancer illnesses (heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, dementia, geriatric failure to thrive, cirrhosis, and end stage renal failure) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospice-philosophy-of-care-and-appropriate-utilization-in-the-united-states/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. These patient characteristics may identify individuals in whom disease-modifying treatment is unlikely to prolong survival and for whom discussion of hospice services may be appropriate.

Therefore, clinical judgment remains a vital tool in determining when a patient is ready for hospice.

However, individual prognostication remains difficult even with such guidelines, particularly for non-cancer diagnoses such as heart, lung, and liver failure, where the disease trajectory is more erratic than with advanced cancer, and death is difficult to predict [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospice-philosophy-of-care-and-appropriate-utilization-in-the-united-states/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

The following common questions frequently arise in discussions of hospice eligibility:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is hospice a place? No - Hospice is a model of care, not a physical location, and hospice is provided in the patient&rsquo;s home, nursing home, or hospital.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What type of treatments can patients receive while being cared for by a hospice program? Hospice services include treatments and interventions that achieve the goal of maximizing comfort and quality of life. In some cases, and depending upon the cost of the treatments, some patients may continue to receive the same treatments they received prior to hospice referral, such as palliative chemotherapy, radiation, and heart failure treatments. In addition, patients can come and go from hospice at any time, if it is not meeting needs or if a new treatment becomes available that is not able to be covered by hospice. Once patients leave hospice, they may return to the program at any time that hospice services fit their care needs, as long as they continue to meet the eligibility criteria (including a prognosis of under six months).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do patients have to be actively dying to receive hospice services? No. Patients do not have to be actively dying to receive hospice care. Patients must show a functional decline and have an estimated prognosis of six months or less to receive hospice services. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do patients have to be DNR to receive hospice? In the US, patients are not legally required to be categorized as &ldquo;Do not resuscitate&rdquo; (DNR) to receive hospice care. However, hospices should help patients understand that enrollment in hospice is a choice to accept that death is imminent and that life-sustaining technologies, such as ventilator therapy, intensive care, and vasopressors, will neither change the underlying progression of disease nor reduce suffering, and are, therefore, not recommended and not typically used while in hospice care. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What happens if a patient is still alive after six months? Roughly 10 percent of hospice beneficiaries &ldquo;fail to die on time&rdquo; and live longer than the six month prognostic limit. Most of these beneficiaries have non-cancer chronic debilitating illnesses like dementia and frailty. When this occurs, the hospice staff are required either to discharge the patient from hospice or justify continued hospice eligibility through demonstration of decline that places them in a high likelihood of death within six months if the disease follows its usual course through the recertification process. Among patients discharged from hospice, a high percentage are hospitalized <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> die soon thereafter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospice-philosophy-of-care-and-appropriate-utilization-in-the-united-states/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some patients fear that entering hospice care hastens death or shortens life. This is a misconception. In fact, several studies have demonstrated a survival advantage (of as long as 100 days in patients with heart failure) among hospice beneficiaries as compared to comparably ill patients who do not receive hospice care. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Benefits'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some patients fear abandonment by their primary physician if they enroll in hospice care. This is not a misconception, as, unfortunately, most physicians fail to continue following their patients after referral to hospice. The primary attending physician can and should continue to play a key role in continuing to care for the patient while on hospice. The long term trusting relationship between a patient and his or her doctor is a key element of quality of care and the ethical principle of non-abandonment. If physicians are uncertain about how to stay involved in their patient&rsquo;s care (and continue to bill) after a hospice referral, information is available from the hospice&rsquo;s medical director or at a <a href=\"http://www.cgsmedicare.com/hhh/education/faqs/hospice_physician_billing_faqs.html&amp;token=k4R5BmqQlydGN2NE48BBTwG+kG/Rw5U4KvSmy0tSyVjwvTWJSAZA22pXPYF2zCjyB3ZdPx3695Kdog02qUR8u/hY8fZJlr54v3Z8RLCQY3A=&amp;TOPIC_ID=2200\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">website detailing how to bill after a hospice referral</a>. &#160; &#160; </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H690304\"><span class=\"h2\">Services</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hospice cares for and supports the patient and family caregivers during the illness and provides bereavement services to family members for up to 13 months after the death of the patient.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-managing-common-non-pain-symptoms-in-palliative-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of managing common non-pain symptoms in palliative care&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-and-management-of-depression-in-palliative-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment and management of depression in palliative care&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pain-assessment-and-management-in-the-last-weeks-of-life\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pain assessment and management in the last weeks of life&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-symptom-assessment-in-palliative-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to symptom assessment in palliative care&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Effective symptom assessment and control requires close collaboration between the nurse case manager and the attending physician. Ideally, to increase the timeliness of care, the attending physician should feel comfortable in extending the ability to adjust medications, within certain parameters, to the nurse case manager. Most hospices use standing orders to facilitate this approach. The attending physician signs approval at the time that the patient is admitted to hospice. As an example, titration of analgesics or other drugs may be specified within predetermined parameters, which can then be adjusted by the nurse without having to constantly refer back to the attending physician for new orders.</p><p>In order to be prepared to handle the possible sudden onset of new symptoms in a patient, hospice provides all patients with a comfort kit at admission to be kept in the patient&rsquo;s home refrigerator. The comfort kit contains medications for pain, dyspnea, agitation, nausea, and constipation in formulations that can be administered by family members in the home. The hospice nurse and medical director can provide families and caregivers with guidance on how and when to administer these medications. Access to medications to control symptoms in the home allows patients on hospice to avert symptom crises and meet their goal of avoiding the hospital and emergency department when possible. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H690264\"><span class=\"h3\">Psychosocial and spiritual care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Psychosocial and spiritual care is of great importance in patients with advanced incurable disease. A humanistic approach, sensitivity to cultural issues, and openness to differing religious and spiritual beliefs are all important. An important concept is to extend similar consideration to the patient&rsquo;s family or caregivers who carry a considerable burden during this time. Support of the family and caregivers is central to good hospice care. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-spirituality-in-palliative-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of spirituality in palliative care&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=psychosocial-issues-in-advanced-illness\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Psychosocial issues in advanced illness&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H690271\"><span class=\"h3\">Nursing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hospice nurse works with the patient, family, and interdisciplinary team to develop a plan of care to assess symptoms and care needs. The primary responsibility for day-to-day care 24 hours per day, seven days per week, typically falls on one or more family members or other identified caregivers which may include friends, as well as privately paid aides. The hospice team visits when necessary and once a week on average to provide support and education. Delivery of hospice care necessitates effective education and ongoing support of the family and other caregivers given the limited time the hospice aides or nurses are able to spend in the home. Family caregivers who report emotional strain have a significantly increased risk of serious illness and death, and support from the hospice team is essential to reducing this burden and stress.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H103949625\"><span class=\"h3\">Short-term intensified services</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>On occasion, the patient care needs can increase. For example, a patient may require more care due to extensive wound care requirements, poorly controlled symptoms, complicated psychosocial issues, family exhaustion, or need for extra support during the active phase of dying. </p><p>In order to address these needs, hospice may provide for additional levels of nursing care for short periods. This may include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Admission to a general inpatient hospice service in a variety of settings, including a hospice facility, hospital, or skilled nursing facility. This short-term care is available to address acute pain and other symptoms that cannot be managed in the home and is typically appropriate for patient care that requires skilled nursing. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>24 hour support or continuous care services &ndash; usually from a licensed practical nurse - in the home for management of acute symptoms, to facilitate keeping the patient at home. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Temporary respite care in a local nursing home or in&ndash;patient hospice facility to give the caregiver a rest from caregiving responsibilities. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H690285\"><span class=\"h3\">Bereavement care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bereavement care of the family and caregivers is a central component of hospice care. Grief and bereavement are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Under the Medicare Hospice Benefit, bereavement support must be provided for 13 months after the patient&rsquo;s death. The precise nature of bereavement services varies. In most cases, there is a process to identify persons at high risk of difficult bereavement (eg, unexpected deaths, multiple deaths in a family in a short space of time, or family or caregivers with poor social support systems). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=grief-and-bereavement-in-adults-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Grief and bereavement in adults: Management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H691082\"><span class=\"h1\">THE US MEDICARE HOSPICE BENEFIT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States, home hospice care for patients over 65 years of age, or for those under 65 who are eligible for Medicare because of long term disability, is covered through Medicare.

Of note, as of August 2013, &ldquo;debility not otherwise specified&rdquo; and &ldquo;adult failure to thrive&rdquo; cannot be listed as the principal hospice diagnosis, although they may be cited as a secondary comorbid condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospice-philosophy-of-care-and-appropriate-utilization-in-the-united-states/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The justification for this decision was that these diagnoses (while near-universal among frail elders with multimorbidity) have indeterminate prognoses, and are therefore not &ldquo;terminal&rdquo; illnesses. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=frailty\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Frailty&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=failure-to-thrive-in-elderly-adults-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Failure to thrive in elderly adults: Evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A table illustrates criteria to determine if a specific patient meets the estimated six month life expectancy based upon either a decline in clinical status generally, or other non-disease-specific criteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F87321\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87321 \">table 1</a>). It is important to point out that determination of decline presumes an assessment of patients over time; therefore it is important that evaluation for hospice services include both report of baseline status, current status, and changes that have occurred over time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospice-philosophy-of-care-and-appropriate-utilization-in-the-united-states/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. For hospice eligibility, the non-disease specific baseline guidelines must be used in conjunction with disease-specific guidelines (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F61282\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61282 \">table 2</a>). Individual prognostication remains difficult even with such guidelines. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H691111\"><span class=\"h2\">Structure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Medicare hospice benefit will pay for a comprehensive array of services related to the terminal condition. Medicare-certified hospice programs provide home-based care including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skilled nursing care, such as symptom assessment and monitoring, wound care, and education of family members</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medical equipment and supplies</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medications related to the terminal condition</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Psychosocial care, particularly by social workers and chaplains</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Limited hours of home health aide or attendant care in the home (usually no more than three <span class=\"nowrap\">hours/day,</span> four times per week)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bereavement support for family and caregivers</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Short-term respite care is available for five days every 30 days when caregivers are overwhelmed at home</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Short-term inpatient care for difficult to control symptoms</p><p/><p>The Medicare hospice benefit is divided into a number of certification periods. The patient is first eligible for two 90-day periods. These are followed by unlimited periods of 60 days each. For each initially 90-day certification period, the attending physician must recertify that the patient is terminally ill. In theory, a patient who continues to show decline can continue to be eligible for hospice care even if he or she has survived longer than the specified six-month period; approximately 10 percent of hospice patients fall into this category of more than six month survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospice-philosophy-of-care-and-appropriate-utilization-in-the-united-states/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. As of January 1, 2011, Medicare has mandated a face-to-face encounter, non-billable visit by a physician or nurse practitioner for patients surviving into the third benefit period (six months, if the patient is continuously enrolled), once every 60 days.</p><p>For some patients, home hospice care is not feasible, and inpatient residential hospice facilities may be considered. The Medicare hospice benefit and most private insurers (see below) do not cover the cost of room and board at these facilities. These expenses can be significant, often more than $150 to $250 per day. In some states, Medicaid will cover these costs. Acute in-patient hospice facilities are available for short periods (usually under a week) either for complex symptom management that cannot be adequately addressed at home, or during the active dying phase, and is included in and covered by the Medicare Hospice Benefit. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H927854\"><span class=\"h2\">Discharge</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients may be discharged from hospice services if their medical condition stabilizes and they no longer show signs of decline. In these cases, hospice assists with transition of patient care to another provider and these patients may be referred again to hospice services when they again show signs of decline consistent with hospice eligibility. In addition, patients <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> their families may choose to discontinue hospice at any time (sometimes referred to as a live discharge). In one study that included 139 patients who had been discharged from 1 of 18 hospices, the reasons for discharge were [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospice-philosophy-of-care-and-appropriate-utilization-in-the-united-states/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stabilization of their index medical condition (79 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patient or family decision (12 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pursuit of more disease modifying treatment (7 percent)</p><p/><p>In a separate study, the overall incidence and the outcomes of patients who were discharged from hospice were evaluated using national US Medicare claims data for the 2010 calendar year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospice-philosophy-of-care-and-appropriate-utilization-in-the-united-states/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

In a mortality follow-back survey, family members of patients who died in hospice were significantly more satisfied with the care than those of patients who died while receiving care in hospitals, nursing homes, or home health agencies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospice-philosophy-of-care-and-appropriate-utilization-in-the-united-states/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Family survivors are less likely to experience posttraumatic stress disorder and prolonged grief disorder after hospice care as compared to those whose loved ones died in a hospital or intensive care unit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospice-philosophy-of-care-and-appropriate-utilization-in-the-united-states/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Several studies have also demonstrated a survival advantage (of as long as 100 days in patients with heart failure) among hospice beneficiaries as compared to comparably ill patients who do not receive hospice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospice-philosophy-of-care-and-appropriate-utilization-in-the-united-states/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].</p><p>Increasing evidence also suggests that hospice is associated with decreased direct (billed services) costs in the home setting, particularly for patients with cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospice-philosophy-of-care-and-appropriate-utilization-in-the-united-states/abstract/22,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,28</a>]. In contrast, data on the consequences of increased access to, and length of stay in, hospice among nursing home residents suggest that despite reduced hospital utilization, total Medicare spending is actually higher for hospice beneficiaries in nursing homes, by an average of around $6000 per person [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospice-philosophy-of-care-and-appropriate-utilization-in-the-united-states/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Changes to the hospice reimbursement rate beginning in 2016 (with higher rates early and late in the stay and lower rates in the middle of the stay) are intended to address this issue. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=palliative-care-nursing-home#H2980652\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Palliative care: Nursing home&quot;, section on 'Initiatives to improve palliative care in long-term care settings'</a>.)</p><p>Finally, utilization of hospice increases the likelihood that an individual will die at home:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Data from the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization (NHPCO) suggest that 80 percent of Americans prefer to die at home but that only approximately 25 percent do [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospice-philosophy-of-care-and-appropriate-utilization-in-the-united-states/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

Under the Medicare Hospice Benefit, Medicare provides a fixed sum of money, paid on a per diem basis, from which all provided medical care must be paid. The following difficulties result:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medical expenses for imaging or laboratory studies, and costly treatments such as transfusions or high-priced symptom medications, which the attending physician feels are indicated to provide optimal palliation of the terminal illness, become the financial responsibility of the hospice under the per diem rate. Larger hospices serving at least 100 persons per day typically have the economies of scale necessary to cover such costs but smaller hospices may be unable or unwilling to absorb them. On October 1, 2013, the Secretary for Health and Human Services, directed by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, revised the hospice payment methodology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospice-philosophy-of-care-and-appropriate-utilization-in-the-united-states/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. As of 2014, hospice patients whose medications are billed through the Medicare prescription drug benefit, called Medicare Part D, will need prior authorization. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hospitalizations are usually avoided once a patient is enrolled in a hospice program. The hospice benefit allows admissions to the hospital for short-term treatment of symptoms that cannot be managed at home. Hospices vary in their use of this aspect of the continuum of hospice care. </p><p/><p>Because of these issues, patients who may benefit from the comprehensive care that hospice provides but who can realistically benefit from continued and simultaneous life-prolonging treatments are not eligible for the Medicare Hospice Benefit. This is especially a problem in patients with illnesses that result in a prolonged period of severe disability, such as heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), advanced dementia, or end stage renal disease, in whom hospice enrollment may be delayed because of a desire to continue disease-modifying therapies, or because of prognostic uncertainty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospice-philosophy-of-care-and-appropriate-utilization-in-the-united-states/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p>In part as a result of these issues, hospice is underutilized, with over one-third of patients utilizing hospice for less than one week, and the national hospice median length of stay in the United States is approximately 17 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hospice-philosophy-of-care-and-appropriate-utilization-in-the-united-states/abstract/3,18,34-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,18,34-38</a>].

The hospice philosophy aims to help patients achieve comfort and quality of life until death with dignity: the care and treatment provided are based on the patient's and family&rsquo;s goals and values. The hospice model is one of interdisciplinary team care that provides comprehensive care by addressing the physical, psychological, social, and spiritual aspects of suffering. Hospice care can be provided in hospitals, nursing homes, and freestanding hospice inpatient facilities. (See <a href=\"#H51426050\" class=\"local\">'The hospice model of care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Palliative care focuses on preventing and relieving suffering and on supporting the best possible quality of life for patients and their families facing serious illness.&nbsp;Within an integrated model of medical care, palliative care can and should be provided at the same time as curative or life-prolonging care. Hospice is a model of palliative care that is offered to patients at the end of life when curative or life-prolonging therapy is no longer indicated. While all care that is delivered by hospices can be considered palliative care, not all palliative care is delivered through hospice programs. (See <a href=\"#H103949484\" class=\"local\">'Distinction between hospice and palliative care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hospice services become appropriate when patients and their families decide to forego disease modifying (&ldquo;curative&rdquo;) therapies in order to focus on maximizing comfort and quality of life, when curative treatments are no longer beneficial, when the burdens of these treatments outweigh their benefits, or when patients are entering the last weeks to months of life. For patients with a non-cancer terminal illness, it may be difficult to identify a population with a survival prognosis of six months or less. Clinicians should err on the side of making the referral for chronically ill patients with decreased functional status, poor quality of life, physical and psychological distress, family caregiver burden and stress under circumstances where the goals of care are comfort, being at home, and staying in control. (See <a href=\"#H355801997\" class=\"local\">'Who is a candidate for hospice?'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Hospice provides high-quality end of life care, but it is often under-utilized or initiated too late in a patient&rsquo;s course.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While symptom control is one of the most important services provided by hospice, other services include nursing care and support at home, psychosocial and spiritual care, respite care, and bereavement care. (See <a href=\"#H690304\" class=\"local\">'Services'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the US, home hospice care for patients over 65 years of age or for those eligible for Medicare because of either longer than two years of a disability or dialysis dependent end stage kidney disease is covered through Medicare. (See <a href=\"#H691082\" class=\"local\">'The US Medicare hospice benefit'</a> above.) Most other private insurers and Medicaid also cover hospice.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The advantages of hospice care include comprehensive interdisciplinary care, support to care for dying patients in the home (including 24-hour phone access to on-call nurses and clinicians, seven days per week), and reduction in out-of-pocket expenses for related medical costs, including medications and durable medical equipment. Some limitations include reliance on family or private pay caregivers to attend to daily needs of patients and the restriction of insurance coverage for some life-prolonging or expensive palliative treatments including specific anticancer treatments and radiation therapy. However, patients may leave and return to the hospice program at any time, as long as they continue to meet the eligibility criteria (including a prognosis of under six months). (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Benefits and limitations of hospice'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Studies have shown that early discussions of hospice as a care option, which also include acknowledgment of the serious and eventually fatal nature of the patient&rsquo;s underlying disease, can increase the likelihood of future hospice enrollment.
