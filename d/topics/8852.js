The genus <em>Campylobacter</em> comprises 20 species isolated from humans and many more isolated from animals.

These organisms can cause a variety of infections including intestinal, systemic, <span class=\"nowrap\">fetal/placental</span> (abortion, stillbirth), and oral (periodontitis). Certain closely related species of <em>Arcobacter</em> and <em>Helicobacter</em> also cause human infection and may be provisionally identified as campylobacters in clinical laboratories. </p><p>The clinical relevance of less common <em>Campylobacter</em> infections will be reviewed here [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infection-with-less-common-campylobacter-species-and-related-bacteria/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

Systemic campylobacteriosis can also be associated with focal infection such as cellulitis or septic arthritis. </p><p>There are two subspecies, <em>C. fetus</em> subspecies <em>fetus</em> and <em>C. fetus</em> subspecies <em>venerealis</em>. <em>C. fetus</em> subspecies <em>fetus</em> is the subspecies usually found in human infection (referred to as <em>C. fetus</em>). Human infection with <em>C. fetus</em> subspecies <em>venerealis</em> is limited to a small number of case reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infection-with-less-common-campylobacter-species-and-related-bacteria/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. <em>C. fetus</em> is an important cause of abortion in sheep and cattle. Cows are infected venereally from carrier bulls with C. fetus subspecies venerealis. <em>C. fetus</em> possesses a surface layer protein (SLP) that functions as a capsule and protects the bacterium from the bactericidal action of normal serum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infection-with-less-common-campylobacter-species-and-related-bacteria/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. The SLPs are critical in virulence and undergo high-frequency phenotypic switching by recombination, resulting in antigenic variation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infection-with-less-common-campylobacter-species-and-related-bacteria/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. The antigenic variation is thought to be responsible for the ability of the organism to persist in animal and human hosts and may account for relapsing human infection despite seemingly effective antibiotic therapies. Most other campylobacters (including <em>C. jejuni</em> and <em>C. coli</em>) do not possess SLP and are readily eliminated from the bloodstream.</p><p><em>C. fetus</em> is found in various animals and animal products, mainly cattle and sheep, which are probably the main source of human infection. Food-borne sources of infection likely include raw milk products, raw liver, and raw meat of such animals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infection-with-less-common-campylobacter-species-and-related-bacteria/abstract/74,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">74,75</a>].

Localizing signs are usually absent, and the first indication of the nature of the illness is isolation of <em>C. fetus</em> from the blood. <em>C. fetus</em> has a tropism for endovascular tissue, so endocarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infection-with-less-common-campylobacter-species-and-related-bacteria/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>], infected aneurysms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infection-with-less-common-campylobacter-species-and-related-bacteria/abstract/80,81\" class=\"abstract_t\">80,81</a>], or septic thrombophlebitis may be observed. Other forms of focal infection can occur; these include meningoencephalitis, osteomyelitis, empyema, cholecystitis, pericarditis, myocarditis, peritonitis, and salpingitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infection-with-less-common-campylobacter-species-and-related-bacteria/abstract/2,82\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,82</a>].</p><p>Healthy persons who develop <em>C. fetus</em> gastroenteritis will usually recover without antibiotic therapy. However, immunocompromised persons or those with bacteremia or other extraintestinal infection may require a prolonged course of antimicrobial treatment. The organism is generally susceptible to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a>, third-generation cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imipenem-and-cilastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imipenem</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meropenem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meropenem</a>; these agents have been used effectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infection-with-less-common-campylobacter-species-and-related-bacteria/abstract/83-85\" class=\"abstract_t\">83-85</a>]. As an example, in a small series of patients with <em>C. fetus</em> bacteremia, all of six patients treated with imipenem and 7 of 11 treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amoxicillin-and-clavulanate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amoxicillin-clavulanate</a> had favorable outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infection-with-less-common-campylobacter-species-and-related-bacteria/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. In contrast, use of fluoroquinolones was associated with death in a separate series of 94 cases of <em>C. fetus</em> bacteremia, among which the fluoroquinolone resistance rate was 33 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infection-with-less-common-campylobacter-species-and-related-bacteria/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. Because many isolates are resistant, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=erythromycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">erythromycin</a> should not be used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infection-with-less-common-campylobacter-species-and-related-bacteria/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>].</p><p>There are no therapeutic trials on which to base treatment duration recommendations. Endovascular infections should probably be treated for at least four weeks. Infection of the central nervous system should be treated for at least two to three weeks. Persistent or relapsing infection with <em>C. fetus</em> can occur, even years after the initial diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/infection-with-less-common-campylobacter-species-and-related-bacteria/abstract/73,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">73,75</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">FETAL/PLACENTAL INFECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Campylobacter enteritis</em> during pregnancy occurs with relative frequency; a very small proportion of fetuses are affected.
