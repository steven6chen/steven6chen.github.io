Diarrhea is very common. Most adolescents and adults have diarrhea about 4 times a year. Just about everyone has it at some point.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H461426771\"><span class=\"h1\">What causes diarrhea?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diarrhea can be caused by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Viruses</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bacteria that live in food or water</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Parasites, such as tiny worms that you can catch in some countries</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Side effects from some medicines</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Problems digesting certain types of food</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diseases that harm the digestive system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F66110\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66110 \">figure 1</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H461426778\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to get better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Here are some things you can try at home:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drink a lot of liquids that have water, salt, and sugar. Good choices are water mixed with juice, flavored soda, and soup broth. If you are drinking enough fluids, your urine will be light yellow or almost clear.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Try to eat a little food. Good choices are potatoes, noodles, rice, oatmeal, crackers, bananas, soup, and boiled vegetables. Salty foods help the most.</p><p/><p>Some people can also take a medicine called <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loperamide-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">loperamide</a> (brand name: Imodium). You should not take this medicine if you have a fever, bloody bowel movements, or severe belly pain. Do not take more than the label tells you to. Taking too much loperamide has led to serious heart problems in some people. If you have health problems or already take other medicines, talk to your doctor or nurse before trying loperamide.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H461426785\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>See your doctor or nurse if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your symptoms still aren't better after 48 hours</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have had more than 6 runny bowel movements in 24 hours</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have lots of small bowel movements with blood or mucus</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your diarrhea is black or bloody</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have a fever higher than 101.3&ordm;F (38.5&ordm;C)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have severe belly pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You are 70 or older</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You have diarrhea after finishing antibiotics</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your body has lost too much water. This is called dehydration. Signs include:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Lots of diarrhea that is very watery</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Feeling very tired</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Thirst</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Dry mouth or tongue</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Muscle cramps</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Dizziness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Confusion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Urine that is very yellow, or not needing to urinate for more than 5 hours</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H461426792\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many people don't need any tests at all. But it's possible your doctor will want to do:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood tests</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urine tests</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tests on a sample of your bowel movements</p><p/><p>These tests can show whether you have an infection, and if so, what kind. They can also show if you are dehydrated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H461426799\"><span class=\"h1\">How is diarrhea treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>That depends on what is causing your diarrhea. You might not need any treatment. If you do, your doctor might recommend:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotics &ndash; These medicines fight infections.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines that ease diarrhea, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=loperamide-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">loperamide</a> (brand name: Imodium), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenoxylate-and-atropine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">diphenoxylate-atropine</a> (brand name: Lomotil), or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bismuth-subsalicylate-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">bismuth subsalicylate</a> (brand names: Pepto-Bismol, Kaopectate)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fluids through an IV.

An IV can help if you have severe dehydration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stopping some of your medicines</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Changing the foods you eat</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H461426806\"><span class=\"h1\">Can diarrhea be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>You can reduce your chances of getting and spreading diarrhea by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Washing your hands after changing diapers, cooking, eating, going to the bathroom, taking out the trash, touching animals, and blowing your nose.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Staying home from work or school until you feel better.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Paying attention to food safety.
