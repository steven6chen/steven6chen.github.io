After an episode of chickenpox, the virus resides in cells of the nervous system. The term &quot;shingles&quot; comes from a Latin word, &quot;cingulum&quot;, which means belt or girdle; the rash of herpes zoster usually appears in a band or belt-like pattern.</p><p>Shingles can affect people of all ages. It is particularly common in adults over age 50 years. It is also more common in individuals of all ages with conditions that weaken the immune system.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">SHINGLES CAUSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Shingles is caused by the varicella-zoster virus, the same virus that causes chickenpox. After an episode of chickenpox, the virus retreats to cells of the nervous system, where it can reside quietly for decades. However, later in life, the varicella-zoster virus can become active again. When it reactivates, it causes shingles. </p><p>The virus belongs to a group of viruses called herpesviruses, which also includes the herpes simplex virus (HSV); HSV-1 causes cold sores and HSV-2 causes genital herpes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genital-herpes-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Genital herpes (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK OF SHINGLES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Up to 20 percent of people will develop shingles during their lifetime. The condition only occurs in people who have had chickenpox, although occasionally, chickenpox is mild enough that you may not be aware that you were infected in the past.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Shingles can occur in individuals of all ages, but it is much more common in adults aged 50 years and older.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Immune status</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Shingles can occur in healthy adults. However, some people are at a higher risk of developing shingles because of a weakened immune system. The immune system may be weakened by:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain cancers or other diseases that interfere with a normal immune response</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immune-suppressing medications used to treat certain conditions (eg, rheumatoid arthritis) or to prevent rejection after organ transplantation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chemotherapy for cancer</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that causes AIDS</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">SHINGLES SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Shingles usually begins with unusual sensations, called parasthesias, such as itching, burning, or tingling in an area of skin on one side of the body. Some people develop a fever, a generalized feeling of being unwell, or a headache. Within one to two days, a rash of blisters appears on one side of the body in a band-like pattern (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F50627%7EPI%2F66249\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef50627 graphicRef66249 \">picture 1A-B</a>).</p><p>The trunk (chest, upper, or lower back) is usually affected by the shingles rash (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F74926\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74926 \">figure 1</a>). The rash can also occur on the face; a rash appearing near the eye can permanently affect vision (see <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Eye complications'</a> below).</p><p>The pain of shingles can be mild or severe, and usually has a sharp, stabbing, or burning quality. Pain may begin several days before the rash. Pain is limited to the skin affected by the rash, but it can be severe enough to interfere with daily activities and sleep. Pain is often worse in older adults compared to younger individuals.</p><p>Within three to four days, the shingles blisters can become open sores or &quot;ulcers&quot;. These ulcers can sometimes become infected with bacteria. In individuals with a healthy immune system, the sores crust over and are no longer infectious by day 7 to 10, and the rash generally disappears within three to four weeks. Scarring and changes in skin color may persist long after shingles has resolved.</p><p>In most individuals, shingles runs its course without any lasting health problems. However, the condition can be associated with complications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Is shingles contagious?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is not possible to catch shingles from another person. However, some people can become infected with the varicella-zoster virus itself:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you have <strong>never had</strong> chickenpox or the chickenpox vaccine, you can develop chickenpox after direct (skin to skin) contact with a shingles blister or by inhaling the varicella-zoster virus in the air. You should take precautions if you are near anyone with shingles. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chickenpox-prevention-and-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Chickenpox prevention and treatment (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you have had chickenpox or the chickenpox vaccine, being near a person with shingles will not cause you to develop shingles.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">SHINGLES COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complications of shingles can occur in anyone with the condition, but are more likely in older adults and in those with a weakened immune system. Overall, complications occur in about 12 percent of all individuals with shingles.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Postherpetic neuralgia is the most common complication of shingles. It causes mild to severe pain or unpleasant sensations and is often described as &quot;burning&quot;. Postherpetic neuralgia affects 10 to 15 percent of patients, with about half of these cases in individuals older than 60 years.</p><p>In most patients, the pain of postherpetic neuralgia gradually improves over time. Some patients continue to experience pain for months to years after the rash resolves. This pain can be so severe that it causes difficulty sleeping, weight loss, depression, and interferes with normal daily activities. Several treatments are available to both prevent and treat postherpetic neuralgia. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of postherpetic neuralgia'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Skin infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The sores of shingles can become infected with bacteria, and this can delay healing. This complication occurs in about 2 percent of individuals. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=skin-and-soft-tissue-infection-cellulitis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Skin and soft tissue infection (cellulitis) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Eye complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Eye complications occur in about 2 percent of individuals. Eye complications are much more likely to occur when the shingles rash occurs around the eye. These complications are serious and can lead to vision loss.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Eye inflammation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Eye inflammation (called herpes zoster ophthalmicus) typically begins with fever, headache, decreased vision, a droopy eyelid, and a generalized feeling of being unwell. These symptoms are accompanied by pain or extreme sensitivity of the eye, forehead, and top of the head.</p><p>Early diagnosis and treatment are important in preventing worsening eye inflammation and vision loss. People who have zoster lesions near an eye should be evaluated immediately by an eye specialist. Treatment usually includes oral acyclovir, valacyclovir, or famciclovir plus steroid eye drops to reduce inflammation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Retinal inflammation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Herpes zoster of the eye can cause inflammation and damage of the retina (called acute retinal necrosis). The retina is in the back of the eye, and is the part of the eye that senses light and enables vision. Retinal inflammation can progress rapidly in individuals with HIV infection.</p><p>Retinal inflammation usually begins with blurry vision and pain in one eye. In up to 50 percent of individuals, it later affects the other eye. It is treated with intravenous acyclovir, which improves symptoms within 48 to 72 hours.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Ear inflammation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Herpes zoster can cause inflammation of the ear (called herpes zoster oticus or Ramsay Hunt syndrome). Symptoms include weakness of the facial muscles on the affected side. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-varicella-zoster-virus-infection-herpes-zoster\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of varicella-zoster virus infection: Herpes zoster&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications due to immune suppression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with a weakened immune system, including people infected with HIV and transplant recipients, are at substantial risk for severe varicella zoster virus related complications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h1\">SHINGLES TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment of shingles usually includes a combination of antiviral and pain-relieving medications. The affected areas should be kept clean and dry. Creams or gels might increase the likelihood of a secondary bacterial skin infection and are not recommended.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Antiviral medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antiviral medications stop the varicella zoster virus from multiplying, speed healing of skin lesions, and reduce the severity and duration of pain.</p><p>Antiviral treatment is recommended for <strong>everyone</strong> with shingles, and is most effective when started within 72 hours after the shingles rash appears. After this time, antiviral medications may still be helpful if new blisters are appearing.</p><p>Three antiviral drugs are used to treat shingles: acyclovir (brand name: Zovirax), famciclovir (brand name: Famvir), and valacyclovir (brand name: Valtrex). Acyclovir is the least expensive treatment but it must be taken more frequently than the other drugs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Pain medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pain of shingles and postherpetic neuralgia can be severe, and prescription medications are frequently needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment of postherpetic neuralgia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment is available to reduce pain and maintain quality of life in people with postherpetic neuralgia. Treatment generally begins with a low-dose tricyclic antidepressant, and may also include narcotic medications and an anti-seizure medication.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Tricyclic antidepressants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are commonly used to treat the pain of postherpetic neuralgia. The dose of TCAs is typically much lower than that used for treating depression. It is believed that these drugs reduce pain when used in low doses, but it is not clear how the drug works.</p><p>TCAs used to treat pain include amitriptyline, desipramine, and nortriptyline. It is common to feel tired when starting a tricyclic antidepressant; this is not always an undesirable side effect since it can help improve sleep when TCAs are taken in the evening. TCAs are generally started in low doses and increased gradually. The pain-relief benefit may not be seen for three or more weeks. Tricyclic antidepressants may not be recommended for older adults with heart problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">Oral pain medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prescription pain medications may be recommended if tricyclic antidepressants do not provide enough pain relief.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h3\">Anti-seizure medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medications that are traditionally used to prevent seizures, called anticonvulsants, can sometimes reduce the pain of postherpetic neuralgia. They may be used instead of TCAs. Anticonvulsants commonly used for postherpetic neuralgia include gabapentin (sample brand name: Neurontin) and pregabalin (sample brand name: Lyrica).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h3\">Capsaicin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Capsaicin is a substance derived from chili peppers that can help to treat pain. Capsaicin cream (sample brand name: Zostrix) may be recommended to treat postherpetic neuralgia. However, the side effects of the cream (including burning, stinging, and skin redness) are intolerable for up to one-third of patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h3\">Topical anesthetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lidocaine (sample brand name: Xylocaine) gel is a medicine that you can rub into your skin. Products that stick to your skin and release lidocaine are also available (eg, Lidoderm, which is a skin patch). You can wear these on your skin for up to 12 hours per day. They deliver a small amount of lidocaine to the most painful or itchy areas. However, the benefit of lidocaine is likely to be moderate at best.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h3\">Steroid injections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For people with postherpetic neuralgia who have severe pain despite using the above measures, an injection of steroids directly into the space around the spinal cord may be considered. Steroid injections are not used to treat facial pain.</p><p>In one study of patients with postherpetic neuralgia for at least one year, steroid injections led to good or excellent pain relief in about 90 percent of individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/shingles-beyond-the-basics/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h1\">RETURN TO WORK</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have shingles, you may wonder when it is safe to return to work. The answer depends upon where you work and where your blisters are located.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the blisters are on your face, do not return to work until the area has crusted over, which generally takes seven to 10 days.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the blisters are in an area that you can cover (eg, with a gauze bandage or clothing), you may return to work when you feel well.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you work in a healthcare facility (hospital, medical office, nursing home), consult your healthcare provider about when it is safe to return to work.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVENTION OF SHINGLES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h2\">Vaccination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are two vaccines that have been approved for adults 50 years of age or older to reduce the chance of developing shingles. If you do develop shingles after receiving the vaccine, your infection may be less severe and you are less likely to develop postherpetic neuralgia.</p><p>Both vaccines are given as shots; one form comes in a single dose, while a newer form requires two doses (given two to six months apart). Your doctor can help you decide whether you should get a shingles vaccine, and if so, which form is most appropriate for you.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h2\">Natural boost of immunity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you have had chickenpox previously, you have developed immunity to the virus that causes shingles. However, this immunity declines over time. But, if you are later exposed to a child or adult with chickenpox, your immunity to the virus is &quot;boosted&quot;. This boost may help to reduce your risk of developing shingles.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h1\">WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your healthcare provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your medical problem.</p><p>This article will be updated as needed on our web site (<a href=\"http://www.uptodate.com/patients&amp;token=nygaOTnDuGxGrKiuwLIxjMIsa91xyzRx3QvmgfDh4FTTVfpiGy3XGWFyzaLmJXXU&amp;TOPIC_ID=4023\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.uptodate.com/patients</a>).
