It is far more common among children with DKA than among adults. Young children and those with newly diagnosed diabetes are at highest risk. Symptoms typically emerge during treatment for DKA, but may be present prior to initiation of therapy.</p><p>The pathophysiology, diagnosis, and treatment of cerebral edema in children with DKA will be discussed here. The diagnosis and treatment of DKA in children is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-diabetic-ketoacidosis-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of diabetic ketoacidosis in children and adolescents&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-complications-of-diabetic-ketoacidosis-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and complications of diabetic ketoacidosis in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinically significant cerebral edema occurs in approximately 1 percent of episodes of DKA in children and has a mortality rate of 20 to 90 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-edema-in-children-with-diabetic-ketoacidosis/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Overall mortality rates for diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) in children and adolescents range from 0.15 to 0.51 percent in national population studies in Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-edema-in-children-with-diabetic-ketoacidosis/abstract/4-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-9</a>]; 50 to 80 percent of diabetes-related deaths are caused by cerebral edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-edema-in-children-with-diabetic-ketoacidosis/abstract/1,2,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,10</a>]. Other causes of death from DKA include aspiration pneumonia, multiple organ failure, gastric perforation, and traumatic hydrothorax [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-edema-in-children-with-diabetic-ketoacidosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Subclinical brain swelling, as detected by ventricular narrowing on a computed tomography (CT) scan, has been reported in the majority of children with DKA in some studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-edema-in-children-with-diabetic-ketoacidosis/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>], while others reported much smaller proportions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-edema-in-children-with-diabetic-ketoacidosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. All of these studies were limited by small numbers and lack of appropriate control groups.</p><p>In a study of 41 children with DKA, the intercaudate width of the frontal horns of the lateral ventricles was measured by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-edema-in-children-with-diabetic-ketoacidosis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The lateral ventricles were significantly smaller in patients during treatment for DKA than after recovery (mean width 9.3&plusmn;0.3 versus 10.2&plusmn;0.3 mm, respectively). Fifty-six percent of the children had ventricular narrowing during treatment, and these children were more likely to have mental status changes than those without narrowed ventricles (Glasgow coma scale [GCS] scores below 15 occurred in 12 of 22 with ventricular narrowing, versus 4 of 19 without).</p><p>Despite the lack of a control group, these findings suggest that cerebral swelling occurs commonly in children with DKA. However, it remains unclear whether subclinical brain swelling noted in this study is a precursor to clinically significant cerebral edema and if so, what factors determine progression. Similar changes in mental status have been reported among children with other causes of acidosis, so it is difficult to determine whether the observed mental status changes in this study are due to the cerebral edema or to the underlying acidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-edema-in-children-with-diabetic-ketoacidosis/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9915119\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cause of cerebral edema in diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is not fully understood, and the only definite way to prevent it is to avoid DKA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-edema-in-children-with-diabetic-ketoacidosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Although in the past decade multiple studies have increased our understanding, they all have substantial limitations, including the retrospective nature of the studies, the heterogeneity in the management of each of the patients, and their small sample sizes. These limitations are inevitable given the rare and unpredictable nature of cerebral edema in DKA. Nonetheless, such studies provide general principles for management that are considered safe and are summarized by several consensus statements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-edema-in-children-with-diabetic-ketoacidosis/abstract/10,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,17</a>].</p><p>Cerebral edema is most likely to occur between 4 and 12 hours after the initiation of therapy, but may occur any time within the first 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-edema-in-children-with-diabetic-ketoacidosis/abstract/1,5,11,12,17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5,11,12,17-19</a>]. Rarely, cerebral edema has developed prior to initiation of therapy or after the first 24 hours. Thus, therapy may exacerbate but not initiate the pathologic process(es) leading to cerebral edema.</p><p>Numerous factors have been implicated in the pathophysiology of DKA-related cerebral edema, but none have been proven. Ischemic, vasogenic, osmotic, or cytotoxic processes have been proposed, as discussed below. It is possible that DKA-related cerebral edema is due to a combination of two or more of these factors. In addition, other metabolic and inflammatory factors, such as hyperglycemia-induced increase in blood-brain barrier permeability, and the generation of new solutes within the brain by hyperglycemia itself and by insulin therapy, may contribute to its pathogenesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-edema-in-children-with-diabetic-ketoacidosis/abstract/20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-23</a>].

These observations suggest, therefore, that cerebral ischemia may play a role in the pathophysiology of DKA-related cerebral edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-edema-in-children-with-diabetic-ketoacidosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], a hypothesis further supported by several observations, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased lactate production in the basal ganglia in children with DKA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-edema-in-children-with-diabetic-ketoacidosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breakdown in blood-brain barrier, decrease in neuronal density, and increases in proinflammatory mediators and cytotoxic markers in fatal cases of cerebral edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-edema-in-children-with-diabetic-ketoacidosis/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Vasogenic edema</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term &quot;vasogenic&quot; edema describes a process in which primary damage to the cerebral vascular endothelium results in increased blood-brain barrier permeability or a disturbance in autoregulation, which permits abnormal diffusion of intravascular fluids into the cerebral tissues. A variety of observations suggest that this mechanism is an important contributor to cerebral edema in the setting of DKA: studies using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrate water diffusion into cerebral tissues during treatment for DKA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-edema-in-children-with-diabetic-ketoacidosis/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>], while others suggest an abnormality in blood-brain barrier permeability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-edema-in-children-with-diabetic-ketoacidosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Normal or increased cerebral blood flow and oxygenation has been observed despite hypocapnia, suggesting defective vascular autoregulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-edema-in-children-with-diabetic-ketoacidosis/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. Together, these studies support the idea of a vasogenic mechanism for fluid shifts into the brain during treatment for DKA.</p><p>These studies are small and examine children undergoing treatment for DKA, but without clinical evidence of cerebral edema. It remains unclear whether these observations also describe the mechanisms underlying the more dramatic fluid shifts that occur in children who develop clinically significant cerebral edema.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Osmotic edema as a consequence of fluid therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A common (but unproven) hypothesis is that cerebral edema develops due to osmotic changes and fluid shifts that occur during treatment for DKA. If the extracellular compartment is at a lower osmolarity than the intracellular compartment, osmotic pressure promotes water movement into the intracellular compartment. During DKA, the combination of insulin and fluid repletion lowers the serum glucose and plasma osmolality, promoting osmotic water movement into the brain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-edema-in-children-with-diabetic-ketoacidosis/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. This mechanism provides a logical explanation for the development of cerebral edema during treatment for DKA. However, these fluid shifts happen in all patients with DKA, yet only approximately 1 percent of patients develop clinically significant cerebral edema.</p><p>Proponents of this hypothesis advocate the use of &quot;physiologic management&quot; of DKA that includes a planned replacement of fluid and electrolyte deficits over 48 hours and strongly argue that such an approach reduces the risk of cerebral edema. In one report of patients managed by this method, fluid replacement actually occurred much faster than planned (fluid replacement was complete around 12 hours of therapy rather than 48 hours as planned) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-edema-in-children-with-diabetic-ketoacidosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. The proportion of patients treated for cerebral edema was not lower as compared with other series, perhaps because patients were identified and treated at earlier stages of symptomatology. Remarkably, there was zero mortality and morbidity from cerebral edema in this series. Thus, these observations do not independently support the efficacy of &quot;physiologic management,&quot; although they suggest that early identification of cerebral edema and aggressive intervention with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">mannitol</a> can help eliminate mortality and morbidity.</p><p>Although this &quot;osmotic&quot; hypothesis has some merit, it is not sufficient to explain the development of cerebral edema, since substantial osmotic shifts occur in all patients during treatment for DKA, yet cerebral edema develops in a small minority of patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several risk factors for developing cerebral edema in children with DKA have been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-edema-in-children-with-diabetic-ketoacidosis/abstract/10,17,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,17,19</a>].

However, a larger and well-designed study did not identify either rate of fluid or insulin administration as a risk factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-edema-in-children-with-diabetic-ketoacidosis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Given the lack of definite answers, we suggest cautious use of fluids and insulin during treatment of DKA to minimize any possible risks. We try to correct the effective circulating volume gradually. In the initial stages, we restore glomerular filtration rate with isotonic fluid and avoid hypotonic solutions, aiming for an appropriate rise in serum sodium concentration as the glucose concentration falls. We do not administer bicarbonate.

These symptoms often occur prior to notable changes in head computed tomography (CT).

This should be followed by a more detailed assessment for the more subtle signs of cerebral edema (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53017\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53017 \">table 2</a>) (see <a href=\"#H974012851\" class=\"local\">'Clinical criteria'</a> below) and assessment of risk factors.

The neurologic assessment should be repeated as appropriate (eg, hourly during the first 12 hours of treatment), using the GCS and clinical criteria (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53017\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53017 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F59662\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59662 \">table 1</a>).

Altered mental status in children with severe diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) can be caused by a variety of factors other than cerebral edema, including the degree of dehydration, metabolic derangements, and sleep deprivation. Nonetheless, clinicians should maintain a high level of suspicion for evidence of cerebral edema and intervene promptly if the diagnosis is suspected. By the time definite neurologic abnormalities develop, cerebral edema is already in an advanced stage, and morbidity and mortality are high [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-edema-in-children-with-diabetic-ketoacidosis/abstract/2,17,19,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,17,19,43</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H974012851\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No clinical criteria or tests can accurately diagnose cerebral edema in early stages when it is still reversible.

These clinical findings should be interpreted in the context of the patient's clinical course and individual risk factors for cerebral edema. The threshold for initiating treatment varies among clinicians in this field. In our practice, we typically initiate treatment for cerebral edema under the following circumstances:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Child with risk factors for cerebral edema (age &lt;5 years, first presentation of DKA, or severe acidosis), <strong>and</strong> one or more of the minor criteria listed above, if not otherwise explained (especially if the symptoms develop after initiation of treatment for DKA).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Any</strong> child with DKA and two or more minor criteria (if not otherwise explained), or any major criteria.</p><p/><p>This approach will lead to treatment of some children who do not have cerebral edema, but this is appropriate because of the low risks of treatment and potential benefits of early treatment in preventing the morbidity and mortality associated with cerebral edema. In a study of more than 1800 children with DKA managed with a similar protocol, rates of suspected cerebral edema were 5.3 percent, and adverse neurologic outcomes (death or neurologic damage) were rare (6 of 1868 patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-edema-in-children-with-diabetic-ketoacidosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment should be initiated as soon as cerebral edema is diagnosed or strongly suspected, based on the clinical criteria listed above, rather than relying on findings from computerized tomography (CT) of the head.

Overt changes detectable by head CT occur late in the development of cerebral edema, and many children who do not develop clinical cerebral edema may have reduced ventricular volume, which returns to normal as the diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) resolves.

The mannitol dose may be repeated in two hours, if there is no initial response. The recommendation for mannitol is based upon the suggested beneficial effect of mannitol in several case reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-edema-in-children-with-diabetic-ketoacidosis/abstract/47-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-49</a>]. In a retrospective study of 61 patients with cerebral edema, mannitol did not appear to have either a beneficial or detrimental effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-edema-in-children-with-diabetic-ketoacidosis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. However, the majority of patients in this study presented with symptoms suggesting severe cerebral edema, so these results should not be interpreted to suggest that mannitol is ineffective in earlier stages of cerebral edema.

Moreover, data suggest that although the overall mortality from cerebral edema has decreased over time, the risk of death in those treated with 3 percent saline alone was higher than those treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">mannitol</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-edema-in-children-with-diabetic-ketoacidosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Until further data are available, we suggest using 3 percent saline only as a secondary intervention in patients with progressive symptoms of cerebral edema and no response to mannitol.</p><p>Intubation and mechanical ventilation may be required for the patient with impending respiratory failure. However, aggressive hyperventilation (beyond the baseline hyperventilation present in most patients with DKA) is not recommended because it may decrease cerebral blood flow enough to cause cerebral ischemia and actually increase the extent of brain injury in any form of cerebral edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cerebral-edema-in-children-with-diabetic-ketoacidosis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].

Among children with DKA who develop cerebral edema, the mortality rate is 20 to 25 percent, and 15 to 35 percent of survivors have permanent neurologic sequelae. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children who are younger, newly diagnosed with DKA, or who present with elevated blood urea nitrogen (BUN), more profound acidosis, or neurologic symptoms are at greatest risk for cerebral edema. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend careful evaluation and monitoring for signs and symptoms of cerebral edema in all children undergoing treatment for DKA. These symptoms include headache and recurrent vomiting, especially if these develop during treatment, as well as altered level of consciousness and age-inappropriate incontinence (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F53017\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53017 \">table 2</a>). For patients with risk factors for cerebral edema (young age, first presentation of DKA, or severe acidosis) or any clinical symptoms that raise a question of cerebral edema, the neurologic assessment should be repeated frequently throughout treatment until the patient is clinically recovered from ketoacidosis. (See <a href=\"#H102756501\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring protocol'</a> above and <a href=\"#H118040128\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Changes detectable by head computed tomography (CT) occur late in the development of cerebral edema. Therefore, the decision to treat should be based on clinical evaluation. Imaging may be useful to exclude other causes of neurologic deterioration, but should not delay treatment. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If cerebral edema is diagnosed or strongly suspected based on clinical criteria, we recommend immediate treatment by reducing the rate of fluid administration (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>) and administering <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">mannitol</a> (0.5 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg)</span> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Intubation and mechanical ventilation may be required for the patient with impending respiratory failure. However, aggressive hyperventilation (beyond the baseline hyperventilation present in most patients with DKA) is not recommended (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Treatment options have not been rigorously studied, but prompt and aggressive treatment is appropriate given the high morbidity and mortality of cerebral edema.
