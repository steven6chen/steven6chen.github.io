Patients with HCM are prone to both atrial and ventricular arrhythmias. Many of these arrhythmias are asymptomatic, but some can precipitate hemodynamic collapse and sudden cardiac death (SCD). SCD is a catastrophic and unpredictable complication of HCM and in some patients may be the first presentation of the disease. The assessment of arrhythmic risk and management of patients with ventricular arrhythmias (or at risk for ventricular arrhythmias) are critical components of the clinical evaluation of nearly all patients with HCM.</p><p>The evaluation and management of ventricular arrhythmias and SCD in patients with HCM will be reviewed here.

While the frequency of ventricular arrhythmias is highly variable, the annual incidence of sudden cardiac arrest in the clinically identified general HCM patient population is approximately 1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-assessment-and-management-of-ventricular-arrhythmias-and-sudden-cardiac-death-risk/abstract/1-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-5</a>].</p><p>The frequency of ventricular tachyarrhythmias detected by ambulatory monitoring in patients with HCM has been evaluated in a variety of studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-assessment-and-management-of-ventricular-arrhythmias-and-sudden-cardiac-death-risk/abstract/1,6-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6-13</a>]. As an example, in a study of 178 patients who underwent 24-hour ambulatory monitoring, VPBs were highly prevalent (seen in 88 percent; 12 percent had &ge;500 VPBs) and NSVT was present in 31 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-assessment-and-management-of-ventricular-arrhythmias-and-sudden-cardiac-death-risk/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, there is no evidence to suggest that frequent VPBs are, by themselves, indicative of an increased risk of sustained ventricular arrhythmia. This is similar to other forms of heart disease in which treatment of VPBs alone is warranted only in symptomatic patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ventricular-premature-beats#H15572590\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ventricular premature beats&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p>Other studies have shown lower rates of NSVT (typically asymptomatic), with ranges of 15 to 31 percent of patients with HCM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-assessment-and-management-of-ventricular-arrhythmias-and-sudden-cardiac-death-risk/abstract/1,6-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6-13</a>].

Thus, as with the other major risk factors, massive LVH is most useful if considered within the context of the overall risk profile.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Both echocardiography and cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging are used in clinical practice to determine maximal wall thickness. One report from a large HCM referral center suggested a discrepancy between echocardiography and CMR imaging in the classification of massive LVH in 70 percent of patients (44 of 63 patients), with massive LVH identified more commonly on CMR (83 versus 48 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-assessment-and-management-of-ventricular-arrhythmias-and-sudden-cardiac-death-risk/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. However, the data pertaining to increased sudden death risk in patients with HCM and massive LVH are derived from echocardiographic studies. For this reason, we recommend that if massive hypertrophy (&ge;30 mm) is identified by echocardiography, using reliable measurements, the patients should be considered high risk with consideration of primary prevention ICD therapy. In patients with echo-derived measurements that are &lt;30 mm but in whom CMR demonstrates massive LVH (echo underestimated wall thickness), it would be reasonable to consider an increased risk for SCD as well, with consideration given to placement of an ICD for primary prevention.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The relation of massive LVH and sudden death was highlighted by a study of 480 patients who were followed for a mean of 6.5 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-assessment-and-management-of-ventricular-arrhythmias-and-sudden-cardiac-death-risk/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

An abnormal&nbsp;BP&nbsp;response to exercise is generally defined as a failure to increase systolic BP by at least 20 mmHg from rest to peak exercise or a fall of &gt;20 mmHg from the peak exercise BP during ongoing exercise.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Exercise testing is an important part of the evaluation of patients with HCM, as it provides objective data on exercise capacity, ischemia, and BP response, which guide management. The finding of an abnormal BP response to exercise and its significance with regard to SCD risk is distinct from the finding and implications of markers of ischemia (eg, electrocardiogram [ECG] changes, perfusion defects) that may occur with stress testing, which are discussed separately.

This abnormal BP response during a maximal symptom-limited upright exercise test is associated with an increased risk for SCD, primarily in patients younger than 40 years of age and those with a family history of premature SCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-assessment-and-management-of-ventricular-arrhythmias-and-sudden-cardiac-death-risk/abstract/9,39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,39,40</a>]. In some of these patients, the BP falls below baseline values during or immediately following exercise. Development of a substantial LV outflow tract (LVOT) gradient during exercise may explain the abnormal BP response in a minority of patients. Similar BP responses occur in patients without LVOT obstruction, however, which may be related to inappropriate vasodilatation in nonexercising muscles. In addition, this abnormal BP response is often associated with a relative bradycardia, suggesting activation of the Bezold-Jarisch reflex.

Of the 54 patients who received an ICD for primary prevention, 18 patients (33 percent) experienced a life-threatening ventricular arrhythmia requiring ICD intervention, resulting in an arrhythmic event rate of 4.7 percent per year (compared with 0.9 percent per year in the patients without an LV apical aneurysm), with no difference in the risk of SCD based on the size of the aneurysm. In addition, patients with HCM with apical aneurysm represent the only subgroup of patients with HCM in whom radiofrequency ablation appears successful at treating life-threatening recurrent VT. In this series, recurrent VT requiring &ge;2 ICD shocks occurred in 13 patients, of which six underwent radiofrequency ablation with no recurrence of VT. Of note, the high-risk phenotype of HCM with apical aneurysm stands in contrast to apical HCM patients who, in the absence of any of the conventional sudden death risk factors, are in fact at low risk for experiencing life-threatening <span class=\"nowrap\">VT/VF</span>.

Patients with HCM should not participate in most high-intensity noncompetitive sports, including basketball, ice hockey, sprinting, and singles tennis, although some moderate-intensity and many low-intensity recreational activities are generally considered to be safe when performed in moderation, including biking, doubles tennis, swimming laps, golf, and skating.

For patients who survive an episode of sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) or SCD, we recommend implantation of an ICD for the secondary prevention of SCD. In patients with HCM with &ge;2 of the major noninvasive risk markers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F102357\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef102357 \">table 3</a>), we suggest implantation of an ICD for primary prevention of SCD. In addition, an ICD may also be reasonable in patients with one of the major risk markers, particularly in those patients with a family history of SCD due to HCM, massive left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy &ge;30 mm, and recent unexplained syncope. In patients with one risk marker, but in whom high-risk status remains uncertain, the results of contrast-enhanced cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging can aid in resolving high-risk status and the need for primary prevention ICD therapy. In addition, patients with HCM without conventional risk factors but who have extensive LGE on CMR may be considered higher risk and potentially candidates for device therapy to prevent sudden death. In the absence of other risk markers and extensive LGE, LV outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction does not necessarily constitute high-risk status and the need for an ICD.

They were treated with a variety of strategies, including septal myotomy and medical therapy. Despite treatment, recurrent arrhythmias were common. The survival rates free of recurrent cardiac arrest or death after one, five, and 10 years were 83, 65, and 53 percent, respectively. A high rate of recurrent ventricular arrhythmias in patients with HCM and a history of cardiac arrest or sustained VT is further supported by the frequency of appropriate shocks in patients who received an ICD for secondary prevention of SCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-assessment-and-management-of-ventricular-arrhythmias-and-sudden-cardiac-death-risk/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].

Ventricular arrhythmias can range from isolated ventricular premature beats (VPBs) to nonsustained ventricular tachycardia (NSVT) to sustained ventricular tachycardia (VT) and ventricular fibrillation (VF). While the frequency of ventricular arrhythmias is highly variable, the annual incidence of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in the clinically identified general HCM patient population is approximately 1 percent. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presentation of ventricular arrhythmias in patients with HCM is highly variable, ranging from an absence of symptoms to palpitations to SCD. Most patients with VPBs or NSVT will be asymptomatic or have intermittent palpitations, while on rare occasions SCD can be the initial presentation of sustained VT or VF. (See <a href=\"#H99763689\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Due to the dynamic nature of the HCM, including changes in the composition of the underlying abnormal myocardial substrate over time, all patients with known or suspected HCM should undergo serial evaluations. SCD risk stratification, including history and physical examination, interim family history, echocardiography, ambulatory electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring, and exercise testing, is reasonable to repeat every 12 to 24 months in patients who remain at risk and potentially eligible for implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) for primary prevention of SCD. (See <a href=\"#H99763717\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Risk factors associated with an increased risk of SCD in patients with HCM include prior sustained ventricular tachyarrhythmias or SCD, family history of a close relative with SCD due to HCM, syncope that appears by clinical history to be attributable to a ventricular tachyarrhythmia, massive left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH; &ge;30 mm), and an abnormal blood pressure response to exercise. The risk of SCD increases significantly as the number of risk factors increases, particularly for patients with two or more risk factors. In contrast to sustained VT, a single, slow short burst of NSVT on ambulatory monitoring is not associated with increased risk for <span class=\"nowrap\">VT/VF</span>. (See <a href=\"#H99763724\" class=\"local\">'Risk stratification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SCD is the most feared complication of HCM. The ICD is the best available therapy for patients with HCM who have survived SCD or who are at high risk of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients who survive an episode of sustained VT or sudden cardiac arrest, we recommend implantation of an ICD for secondary prevention of SCD (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H99765267\" class=\"local\">'Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondary-prevention-of-sudden-cardiac-death-in-heart-failure-and-cardiomyopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondary prevention of sudden cardiac death in heart failure and cardiomyopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In patients with HCM with &ge;2 of the major noninvasive risk markers, we suggest implantation of an ICD for primary prevention of SCD (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). In addition, an ICD may also be reasonable in patients with one of the major risk markers, particularly in those patients with a family history of SCD due to HCM, massive LVH &ge;30 mm, and recent unexplained syncope. Because defining the risk level among patients with HCM with one risk factor can be uncertain, a variety of arbitrators such as extensive late gadolinium enhancement (LGE; ie, myocardial fibrosis) identified by contrast-enhanced cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) and marked LV outflow tract (LVOT) obstruction at rest can be used to help resolve otherwise uncertain ICD decision-making on a case-by-case basis. (See <a href=\"#H99765267\" class=\"local\">'Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators'</a> above and <a href=\"#H360925449\" class=\"local\">'Established high-risk clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">In patients with one risk marker, but in whom high-risk status remains uncertain, the results of contrast-enhanced CMR imaging can aid in resolving high-risk status and the need for primary prevention ICD therapy. In addition, patients with HCM without conventional risk factors but who have extensive LGE on CMR may be considered higher risk and potentially candidates for ICD therapy to prevent SCD. (See <a href=\"#H99765267\" class=\"local\">'Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators'</a> above and <a href=\"#H360928877\" class=\"local\">'Possible high-risk features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Age is also an important factor in considering patients at risk. Patients with HCM who have achieved an advanced age of &ge;60 years are at very low risk for disease-related adverse events, including sudden death, even in the presence of conventional risk factors. Therefore, a high threshold is necessary to consider older patients with HCM at high risk and candidates for ICD therapy for primary prevention of SCD. (See <a href=\"#H360928877\" class=\"local\">'Possible high-risk features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In patients with HCM and an LV apical aneurysm, we suggest implantation of an ICD for primary prevention of SCD (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). This is based on the fivefold higher risk of life-threatening ventricular arrhythmias and SCD compared with patients with HCM who do not have an LV apical aneurysm. (See <a href=\"#H360925449\" class=\"local\">'Established high-risk clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with end-stage HCM (characterized by LV systolic dysfunction, wall thinning, and chamber dilation), a high-risk subgroup within the vast phenotypic spectrum of HCM, we strongly consider implantation of an ICD for primary prevention of SCD. (See <a href=\"#H99765267\" class=\"local\">'Implantable cardioverter-defibrillators'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no evidence that pharmacologic therapy provides absolute protection against SCD due to malignant ventricular arrhythmias in patients with HCM. However, medical therapy for ventricular arrhythmias in patients with HCM has an important role in select clinical scenarios:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with asymptomatic VPBs or NSVT, we recommend that pharmacologic therapy not be given for the purpose of arrhythmia suppression (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). However, because NSVT is associated with an increased risk of SCD, its presence should be taken into account when considering the need for ICD therapy for primary prevention of sudden death. (See <a href=\"#H99763875\" class=\"local\">'Medical treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with symptoms due to VPBs or NSVT, we suggest pharmacologic treatment for symptom control (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Beta blockers are the preferred initial therapy, and in refractory cases, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sotalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sotalol</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a>. The purpose of medical therapy is the control of symptoms; it should not be considered an alternative to an ICD in patients at high-risk of SCD. (See <a href=\"#H99763875\" class=\"local\">'Medical treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients with frequent sustained ventricular arrhythmias resulting in ICD shocks should be treated with adjunctive antiarrhythmic therapy, most often <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sotalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sotalol</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a>, with possible consideration of radiofrequency ablation.
