The pathogenesis of UTI begins with colonization of the vaginal introitus or urethral meatus by uropathogens from the fecal flora, followed by ascension via the urethra into the bladder. Pyelonephritis develops when pathogens ascend to the kidneys via the ureters. Pyelonephritis can also be caused by seeding of the kidneys from bacteremia. It is possible that some cases of pyelonephritis are associated with seeding of the kidneys from bacteria in the lymphatics.</p><p>This topic will review the approach to adults with acute complicated UTI (ie, UTI with fever, suspected or documented pyelonephritis, and UTI with sepsis or bacteremia). </p><p>The approaches to acute uncomplicated cystitis (ie, cystitis symptoms in the absence of fever, flank pain, costovertebral angle tenderness, and other signs of systemic illness) and UTIs in special populations are discussed elsewhere:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute uncomplicated cystitis in women&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-uncomplicated-cystitis-in-men\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute uncomplicated cystitis in men&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-infections-and-asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinary tract infections and asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=catheter-associated-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Catheter-associated urinary tract infection in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-infection-in-renal-transplant-recipients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinary tract infection in renal transplant recipients&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=recurrent-urinary-tract-infection-in-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Recurrent urinary tract infection in women&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Asymptomatic bacteriuria is also discussed in detail elsewhere.

Such infections lack signs or symptoms that suggest an infection extending beyond the bladder. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Complicated UTI</strong> &ndash; We use the term acute complicated urinary tract infection (UTI) to refer to an acute UTI with any of the following features, which suggest that the infection extends beyond the bladder:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Fever (&gt;99.<span class=\"nowrap\">9&deg;F/37</span>.7&deg;C) &ndash; This temperature threshold is not well defined and should be individualized, taking into account baseline temperature, other potential contributors to an elevated temperature, and the risk of poor outcomes should empiric antimicrobial therapy be inappropriate.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Other signs or symptoms of systemic illness (including chills or rigors).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Flank pain.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Costovertebral angle tenderness. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Pelvic or perineal pain in men, which can suggest accompanying prostatitis.(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-bacterial-prostatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute bacterial prostatitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-bacterial-prostatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic bacterial prostatitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>By these definitions, pyelonephritis is a complicated UTI, regardless of patient characteristics. Risk factors for infection with drug-resistant organisms do not, on their own, indicate a complicated UTI. </p><p>The distinction between uncomplicated cystitis and complicated UTI is important because the treatment approach differs. Acute complicated UTI is a more serious infection than uncomplicated cystitis. Therefore, expected efficacy of an antimicrobial agent is of greater importance than concern about ecological adverse effects (selection of drug-resistant organisms and the development of colonization or infection with multidrug-resistant organisms), which is a higher priority in the setting of uncomplicated cystitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complicated-urinary-tract-infection-including-pyelonephritis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Furthermore, certain agents used for uncomplicated cystitis should not be used for complicated UTI because they do not achieve adequate levels in tissue, which may be important for cure. Parenteral therapy is sometimes warranted in complicated UTI to ensure appropriate tissue levels and spectrum of coverage. (See <a href=\"#H12414288\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> below.) </p><p>Classically, uncomplicated versus complicated cystitis and pyelonephritis have been defined by patient features such as poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, renal failure, urologic abnormalities, or immunocompromising conditions. However, our clinical approach to managing UTI is based more on the apparent extent of infection, which informs the risk of severe infection, as well as the risk of drug resistance rather than the classic &quot;complicating&quot; patient features, which do not consistently predict either of these factors. Thus, we favor distinguishing between uncomplicated cystitis and complicated UTI as defined above. </p><p>The approach to UTI remains distinct for certain populations, such as pregnant women and renal transplant recipients. These are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-infections-and-asymptomatic-bacteriuria-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinary tract infections and asymptomatic bacteriuria in pregnancy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=urinary-tract-infection-in-renal-transplant-recipients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Urinary tract infection in renal transplant recipients&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12415021\"><span class=\"h1\">MICROBIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Escherichia coli</em> is the most frequent cause of acute complicated urinary tract infections (UTIs). Other uropathogens include other Enterobacteriaceae (such as <em>Klebsiella </em>spp and<em> Proteus </em>spp<em>)</em>, <em>Pseudomonas</em>, enterococci, and staphylococci (methicillin-sensitive <em>Staphylococcus aureus </em>[MSSA], methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus </em>[MRSA], and <em>Staphylococcus saprophyticus</em>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complicated-urinary-tract-infection-including-pyelonephritis-in-adults/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. The prevalence of particular pathogens depends partially on the host. As examples, <em>Pseudomonas</em> is more common in patients with health care exposures or instrumentation, and <em>S. saprophyticus</em> is most often seen in young women. UTI due to <em>Candida</em> spp is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=candida-infections-of-the-bladder-and-kidneys\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Candida infections of the bladder and kidneys&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Risk factors for UTI with resistant organisms include recent broad-spectrum antimicrobial use, health care exposures, and travel to parts of the world where multidrug-resistant organisms are prevalent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complicated-urinary-tract-infection-including-pyelonephritis-in-adults/abstract/4-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-8</a>] (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F114310\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114310 \">table 1</a>). </p><p>Increasing rates of resistance in uropathogens have been reported globally. As an example, in the United States, one study documented a threefold increase in the prevalence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae among hospitalized patients with UTIs from 2000 to 2009 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complicated-urinary-tract-infection-including-pyelonephritis-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. In another study of patients with pyelonephritis presenting to emergency departments across the United States, approximately 6 percent of the 453 <em>E. coli</em> isolates produced ESBL, although rates varied by region and complicating features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complicated-urinary-tract-infection-including-pyelonephritis-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In particular, a specific strain of <em>E. coli</em>, sequence type 131 (ST131), has emerged globally as a major cause of fluoroquinolone-resistant and ESBL-producing <em>E. coli</em> urinary tract infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complicated-urinary-tract-infection-including-pyelonephritis-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In one study of <em>E. coli</em> clinical isolates from extraintestinal sites, predominantly urine, collected at Veterans Affairs (VA) laboratories across the United States, the ST131 clone accounted for the majority of fluoroquinolone-resistant and ESBL isolates and was calculated to account for 28 percent of all VA <em>E. coli</em> isolates nationwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complicated-urinary-tract-infection-including-pyelonephritis-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

Patients with acute complicated UTI also have fever or other features of systemic illness (including chills or rigors), which suggest that infection has extended beyond the bladder. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Symptoms and signs of pyelonephritis classically include fever, chills, flank pain, costovertebral angle tenderness, and <span class=\"nowrap\">nausea/vomiting</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complicated-urinary-tract-infection-including-pyelonephritis-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Symptoms of cystitis are often but not universally present. Atypical symptoms have also been described, with some patients complaining of pain in the epigastrium or lower abdomen.</p><p/><p>For men, the clinical spectrum of UTI includes prostatitis, which should be considered in men presenting with cystitis symptoms that are recurrent or are accompanied by pelvic or perineal pain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-bacterial-prostatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute bacterial prostatitis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-bacterial-prostatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic bacterial prostatitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Not all patients with acute complicated UTI present with clear symptoms localizing to the urinary tract. As an example, patients with spinal cord injury and neurogenic bladder can present with autonomic dysreflexia and increased spasticity. Elderly or debilitated patients may present with more generalized signs or symptoms of infection (eg, fever and chills) without clear symptoms localizing to the urinary tract. </p><p>Pyuria is present in almost all patients with UTI. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1992906243\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with acute complicated UTI can also present with bacteremia, sepsis, multiple organ system dysfunction, shock, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> acute renal failure. This is more likely to occur in patients with urinary tract obstruction, recent urinary tract instrumentation, or other urinary tract abnormalities, and in patients who are elderly or have diabetes mellitus. </p><p>Acute pyelonephritis can also be complicated by progression of the upper urinary tract infection to renal corticomedullary abscess, perinephric abscess, emphysematous pyelonephritis, or papillary necrosis. Risk factors for such complications include urinary tract obstruction and diabetes mellitus (particularly for emphysematous pyelonephritis and papillary necrosis). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-and-perinephric-abscess\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal and perinephric abscess&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=emphysematous-urinary-tract-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Emphysematous urinary tract infections&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Chronic pyelonephritis is an uncommon cause of chronic tubulointerstitial disease due to recurrent infection, such as infection in association with a chronically obstructing kidney stone (possibly producing xanthogranulomatous pyelonephritis) or vesicoureteral reflux.

Acute pyelonephritis, specifically, should be suspected in patients presenting with fever and flank pain, even in the absence of typical symptoms of cystitis. Acute complicated UTI is also often suspected in patients with nonlocalizing fever or sepsis. Evaluation includes examination to assess for other causes of illness and urine studies.</p><p>Physical exam should assess for costovertebral angle, abdominal, and suprapubic tenderness. Among sexually active young women, a pelvic examination may be warranted, particularly if symptoms are not convincing for a UTI, to evaluate for cervical motion or uterine tenderness, which would be suggestive of pelvic inflammatory disease (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-inflammatory-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H854376671\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic inflammatory disease: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Evaluation'</a>). Among men with symptoms of pelvic or perineal pain, cautious digital rectal examination may be warranted to evaluate for a tender or edematous prostate that would suggest acute prostatitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-bacterial-prostatitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute bacterial prostatitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>UTI is often suspected in elderly or debilitated patients who have nonspecific signs or symptoms, such as falls, change in functional status, and change in mental status. However, growing evidence indicates that these are not reliable predictors of bacteriuria or UTI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complicated-urinary-tract-infection-including-pyelonephritis-in-adults/abstract/14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-17</a>]. In the absence of signs of infection or focal urinary tract symptoms, we do not routinely test urine in elderly or debilitated patients with nonspecific changes in mental or functional status, and instead hydrate, carefully observe, and assess other potential contributing factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complicated-urinary-tract-infection-including-pyelonephritis-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-delirium-and-confusional-states#H31\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of delirium and confusional states&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic tests'</a>.)</p><p>For all patients with suspected acute complicated UTI, we send urine for both urinalysis (either by microscopy or by dipstick) and culture with susceptibility testing. Urinalysis results inform the diagnosis. Since pyuria is present in almost all patients with UTI; its absence suggests an alternative diagnosis, particularly in patients who present with nonspecific symptoms. White cell casts, in particular, suggest a renal origin for pyuria. However, pyuria and bacteriuria may occasionally be absent if the infection does not communicate with the collecting system or if the collecting system is obstructed. Growth of bacteria on urine culture also supports the diagnosis of UTI, and susceptibility testing is essential to ensuring appropriate antimicrobial treatment. If available, urine Gram stain can also be helpful to narrow down the list of potential causative organisms and inform empiric antimicrobial selection. (See <a href=\"#H12414288\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> below.)</p><p>Issues related to urine collection and testing as well as interpretation of urine culture colony counts are found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sampling-and-evaluation-of-voided-urine-in-the-diagnosis-of-urinary-tract-infection-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sampling and evaluation of voided urine in the diagnosis of urinary tract infection in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Pregnancy testing is appropriate in women of childbearing potential when the possibility of pregnancy cannot be reasonably excluded by history alone. Blood tests, such as general chemistry and complete blood counts, are not generally necessary unless the patient is hospitalized. Blood cultures are warranted for those who present with sepsis or severe illness.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3170583666\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most patients with acute complicated UTI do not warrant imaging studies for diagnosis or management. Imaging is generally reserved for those who are severely ill, have persistent clinical symptoms despite 48 to 72 hours of appropriate antimicrobial therapy, or have suspected urinary tract obstruction (eg, if the renal function has declined below baseline or if there is a precipitous decline in the urinary output). Imaging is also appropriate in patients who have recurrent symptoms within a few weeks of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complicated-urinary-tract-infection-including-pyelonephritis-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p>The main objective of imaging is to evaluate for a process that may delay response to therapy or warrant intervention, such as a calculus or obstruction, or to diagnose a complication of infection, such as a renal or perinephric abscess [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complicated-urinary-tract-infection-including-pyelonephritis-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Computed tomography (CT) scanning of the abdomen and pelvis (with and without contrast) is generally the study of choice to detect anatomic or physiologic factors associated with acute complicated UTI; it is more sensitive than excretory urography or renal ultrasound for detecting renal abnormalities predisposing to or caused by infection and in delineating the extent of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complicated-urinary-tract-infection-including-pyelonephritis-in-adults/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. CT without contrast has become the standard radiographic study for demonstrating calculi, gas-forming infections, hemorrhage, obstruction, and abscesses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complicated-urinary-tract-infection-including-pyelonephritis-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Contrast is needed to demonstrate alterations in renal perfusion. CT findings of pyelonephritis include localized hypodense lesions due to ischemia induced by marked neutrophilic infiltration and edema (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F62046%7ENEPH%2F69393%7ENEPH%2F51244\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef62046 graphicRef69393 graphicRef51244 \">image 1A-C</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complicated-urinary-tract-infection-including-pyelonephritis-in-adults/abstract/20,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,22</a>].

These include fever (eg, &gt;99.<span class=\"nowrap\">9&deg;F/37</span>.7&deg;C), other signs or symptoms of systemic illness (including chills, rigors, or altered mental status), flank pain, and costovertebral angle tenderness. By this definition, pyelonephritis is a complicated UTI, regardless of patient characteristics. (See <a href=\"#H1932835916\" class=\"local\">'Terminology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Relevant uropathogens include primarily <em>Escherichia coli</em>, but also other Enterobacteriaceae, other gram-negative bacilli (including <em>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</em>), staphylococci, enterococci, and <em>Candida</em> species. Risk factors for resistant organisms include recent broad-spectrum antimicrobial use, health care exposures, and travel to parts of the world where multidrug-resistant organisms are prevalent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F114310\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114310 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H12415021\" class=\"local\">'Microbiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute complicated UTI should be suspected in patients with dysuria, urinary frequency or urgency, or suprapubic pain who also have fever, chills, flank pain, or otherwise appear clinically ill. Acute pyelonephritis, specifically, should be suspected in patients presenting with fever and flank pain, even in the absence of typical symptoms of cystitis. In men, pelvic or perineal pain accompanying urinary symptoms suggests prostatitis. UTI is also often suspected in patients with pyuria and bacteriuria who have nonspecific signs of systemic illness, such as lethargy or delirium, and in patients with nonlocalizing fever or sepsis. (See <a href=\"#H12414267\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1421905164\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with suspected acute complicated UTI, we send urine for both urinalysis (either by microscopy or by dipstick) and culture with susceptibility testing. Imaging is generally reserved for those who are severely ill, have suspected urinary tract obstruction, have persistent symptoms despite 48 to 72 hours of appropriate antimicrobial therapy, or have recurrent symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H1421905164\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3170583666\" class=\"local\">'Imaging'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of acute complicated UTI is made in patients who have consistent clinical findings as well as pyuria and bacteriuria. UTI is unlikely if pyuria is absent. (See <a href=\"#H3048399109\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Outpatient management is acceptable for patients with acute complicated UTI of mild to moderate severity who can be stabilized, if necessary, with rehydration and antimicrobials in an outpatient facility or the emergency department and discharged on oral antimicrobials with close follow-up. (See <a href=\"#H3104360530\" class=\"local\">'Indications for hospitalization'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The approach to empiric therapy of acute complicated UTI depends on the severity of illness, the risk factors for resistant pathogens, and specific host factors (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F115994\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef115994 \">algorithm 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F116091\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef116091 \">algorithm 2</a>).

(See <a href=\"#H1551581455\" class=\"local\">'Critical illness and/or urinary tract obstruction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For other hospitalized patients, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=piperacillin-and-tazobactam-sodium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">piperacillin-tazobactam</a> if there are no risk factors for multidrug resistance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F114310\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114310 \">table 1</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Oral or parenteral fluoroquinolones are also reasonable options. For such patients who have risk factors for multidrug resistance, we suggest an antipseudomonal carbapenem (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4071370685\" class=\"local\">'Other hospitalized patients'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For outpatients without risk factors for multidrug resistance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F114310\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114310 \">table 1</a>), we suggest an oral fluoroquinolone, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levofloxacin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). If the community prevalence of <em>E. coli</em> fluoroquinolone resistance is known to be higher than 10 percent, we also suggest a single dose of a long-acting parenteral agent prior to administering the fluoroquinolone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2493517473\" class=\"local\">'Low risk of MDR infection'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For outpatients with risk factors for multidrug resistance (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F114310\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114310 \">table 1</a>), we suggest an initial dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ertapenem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ertapenem</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Subsequently, an oral fluoroquinolone or daily ertapenem can be used. (See <a href=\"#H486606063\" class=\"local\">'High risk of MDR infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Results of urine culture and susceptibility testing should be used to confirm that the chosen empiric regimen is active and to tailor the regimen, including switching a parenteral regimen to an oral agent once symptoms have improved. Appropriate oral agents to treat acute complicated UTI include fluoroquinolones (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">levofloxacin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciprofloxacin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciprofloxacin</a>, given for 5 to 7 days) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> (given for 7 to 10 days). Oral beta-lactams (given for 10 to 14 days) are less effective for acute complicated UTI but are appropriate alternatives if susceptibility is documented and the other agents are not feasible. (See <a href=\"#H945200358\" class=\"local\">'Directed antimicrobial therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who have underlying anatomical or functional urinary tract abnormalities (including neurogenic bladder, indwelling bladder catheters, nephrostomy tubes, urethral stents) may warrant additional management, such as more frequent catheterization to improve urinary flow, exchange or removal of a catheter, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> urologic or gynecologic consultation.
