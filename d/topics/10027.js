Because consciousness and higher cortical functions are spared, patients can sometimes communicate through eye movements.</p><p>Alexandre Dumas provided one of the earliest descriptions of LIS in &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot; by vividly depicting a character who was &quot;a corpse with living eyes.&quot; Following a stroke, Monsignor Noirtier de Villefort could only communicate by raising, closing, or winking his eyes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/locked-in-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Issues related to LIS will be reviewed here. Conditions superficially similar to LIS, such as coma, minimally conscious state, and persistent vegetative state, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stupor-and-coma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stupor and coma in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION AND ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In 1966, Plum and Posner coined the term &quot;locked-in&quot; to describe the state of quadriplegia and anarthria (speechlessness due to severe dysarthria) with preserved consciousness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/locked-in-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Synonymous with locked-in syndrome (LIS) are &quot;de-efferented state,&quot; &quot;pseudocoma,&quot; and &quot;coma vigilante.&quot;</p><p>There are two requisites for the diagnosis of locked-in syndrome:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Retained alertness and cognitive abilities</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Paralysis of the limbs and oral structures such that the individual cannot signal with the limbs or speak</p><p/><p>The important neuronal tracts that are disrupted in patients with LIS course from the cortex toward the bulbar motor neurons and spinal cord by traveling through the brainstem. Limb movements are mediated by the tracts to the spinal cord neurons that travel in the basal and ventral portions of the brainstem; these include the cerebral peduncles in the midbrain, the base of the pons, and the medullary pyramids. Bilateral lesions of these structures cause a loss of voluntary limb movement accompanied by exaggerated deep tendon reflexes, limb spasticity, and extensor plantar reflexes (Babinski signs).</p><p>Motor function of the mouth, pharynx, and jaws is mediated by the corticobulbar fibers that travel in the dorsal portion of the midbrain and pons near the tegmental-basal junction and synapse with the motor neurons located in the ambiguous (cranial nerves IX, X, XI), trigeminal (cranial nerve V), and facial (cranial nerve VII) nuclei. Bilateral lesions involving these fibers cause a loss of voluntary mouth and tongue movement as well as loss of speech and swallow.</p><p>The structures within the brainstem that control eye movements and consciousness are located in the dorsal portion of the tegmentum in the midbrain and pons near the midline. The eye movement nuclei (cranial nerves III, IV, VI) and connecting pathways that relate to eye movements (the medial longitudinal fasciculi [MLF], and the so-called pontine lateral gaze center in the paramedian pontine reticular formation [PPRF]) are symmetrically represented in the medial tegmentum on each side of the midline. Bilateral lesions that involve these structures cause a loss of horizontal eye movements. When the lesions involve only one side, some horizontal eye movement is preserved.</p><p>The medial and lateral reticular formation subserves consciousness and the control of respiratory, cardiac, and vasomotor functions, respectively. The portion of the reticular activating system that relates to consciousness is located in the paramedian tegmentum, while cardiovascular and respiratory-related structures are located more laterally in the tegmentum of the pons and medulla oblongata.</p><p>Lesions must involve the medial tegmentum bilaterally to cause coma. Automatic respirations and cardiovascular functions are not affected if the brainstem tegmental lesions are paramedial, and lateral tegmental structures are spared. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stupor-and-coma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stupor and coma in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common cause of locked-in syndrome (LIS) is ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke, accounting for 38 of 44 cases in a review from France [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/locked-in-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Ischemic infarction of the ventral pons is usually due to basilar artery embolism or thrombosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F56754\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56754 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/locked-in-syndrome/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The most vulnerable territory is the paramedian base of the pons. Because the tegmentum has generous collateral supply that courses from the lateral aspect, the lateral and medial tegmentum are often spared. Midbrain infarction or traumatic injury of the bilateral cerebral peduncles causing LIS has also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/locked-in-syndrome/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>].</p><p>A second cause of stroke-induced LIS is pontine hemorrhage, which is most often related to hypertension but can also result from vascular malformations. Hypertensive pontine hemorrhages typically begin at the tegmentobasal junction and usually cause coma, loss of horizontal gaze, quadriplegia, and eventually death. A residual locked-in state is rare.</p><p>Other causes of LIS include trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/locked-in-syndrome/abstract/3,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,7</a>], pontine abscess [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/locked-in-syndrome/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], brainstem tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/locked-in-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], central pontine myelinolysis, toxins, and heroin abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/locked-in-syndrome/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bilateral ventral pontine damage causes quadriplegia and inability to speak or swallow, but consciousness is preserved. Because the supranuclear ocular motor pathways lie more dorsally, patients with locked-in syndrome (LIS) can move their eyes. Thus, voluntary blinking and vertical eye movements remain intact, but the patient cannot otherwise move muscles in the limbs, trunk, or face.</p><p>Sparing of the reticular formation allows for normal wakefulness, but sleep-wake cycles may be abnormal depending on the extent of damage to the intricate sleep pathways in the brainstem. Various abnormalities have been identified in both REM and non-REM sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/locked-in-syndrome/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Tegmental lesions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In some patients, the initial dysfunction (most often ischemia) also extends to the tegmentum of the pons on one or both sides. Bilateral lesions affecting the paramedian tegmentum result in coma and loss of horizontal eye movements. Vertical eye movements, which are controlled in the rostral portion of the brainstem, are preserved. Sometimes, the eyes bob downward spontaneously or when the head is rolled from side to side in the &quot;doll's eyes&quot; maneuver.</p><p>With unilateral pontine tegmental lesions, consciousness is preserved. In such cases, the eye movement abnormality may consist of one of the following types:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loss of horizontal conjugate gaze to the side of the lesion</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO) manifested by abnormalities of gaze to the opposite side that are due to loss of adduction of the ipsilateral eye along with nystagmus of the abducting eye. As an example, a lesion of the left medial longitudinal fasciculus (MLF) would result in loss of rightward movement of the left eye and nystagmus of the right eye during attempted gaze to the right side. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=internuclear-ophthalmoparesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Internuclear ophthalmoparesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A combination of the lateral gaze and internuclear deficits referred to as a &quot;one-and-a half&quot; syndrome. If gaze to each side is tallied as one, the only gaze remaining is abduction of one eye, ie, only one-half of the usual two movements. As an example, a lesion of the left pontine tegmentum affecting both the paramedian pontine reticular formation (PPRF) and the MLF would result in the only residual movement being abduction of the right eye on right lateral gaze.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Other</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many patients with LIS retain some other voluntary movements beside vertical eye motion such as horizontal gaze, facial expression, limb, head, or tongue movements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/locked-in-syndrome/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Patients with LIS may have various different involuntary motor phenomena including ocular bobbing, crying, trismus, oral automatisms, groaning, facial grimacing, yawning, palatal myoclonus, sighing, coughing, bruxism, and laughing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/locked-in-syndrome/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Some have involuntary limb movements that resemble seizures, especially when they first become weak [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/locked-in-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. These movements can be periodic limb stiffening, shivering, and dystonic postures.</p><p>Respiration is often affected in LIS when the lateral tegmentum of the pons or medulla is involved. Patients may require assistance in ventilation and pulmonary toilet. The lips, tongue, and soft palate are all thoroughly weakened as to prevent coordination of breathing, voluntary vocalization, or swallowing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In order to establish the diagnosis of locked-in syndrome (LIS), it is imperative to demonstrate preservation of consciousness, alertness, and cognitive function in a patient with paralysis of the limbs and oral structures. Observation and examination of eye movements during bedside interaction is the key to making this determination, since patients with LIS cannot respond to questions by speaking or moving the limbs. The diagnosis can easily be missed if voluntary vertical eye movements are not examined with great care in patients who seem unresponsive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/locked-in-syndrome/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Vertical eye movements should be reexamined in otherwise unresponsive patients if brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) shows a lesion in the ventral pons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/locked-in-syndrome/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In addition, eye movements should be reexamined over time, as some patients may emerge from coma into a locked-in state after a variable delay. Hearing may recover before eye opening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/locked-in-syndrome/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Some investigators have noted that patients with LIS tire quickly when using vertical eye movements to communicate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/locked-in-syndrome/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In addition, patients with LIS may have a severely limited attention span in the first weeks or months after onset of LIS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/locked-in-syndrome/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Because of the inherent difficulty in diagnosing LIS, the diagnosis is often delayed. In a review of 44 cases from France, the mean time to diagnosis of LIS was 79 days after onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/locked-in-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The neurological exam should begin by determining whether the patient is awake, opens eyes to voice, blinks to command, and can move the limbs. The paralyzed patient with LIS will be able to respond to complex linguistic requests with vertical eye movements and blinking but cannot move the limbs or speak.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Neuroimaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infarction and other structural lesions of the brainstem including tumor, abscess, and contusions are best visualized on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) because computed tomography (CT) provides less complete visualization of the posterior segments of the brain. MRI with diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) is the most sensitive test to detect acute infarcts.</p><p>An MR angiogram (MRA) can identify the location and severity of vascular occlusions in the extracranial arteries of the neck and intracranial circulation. Patients with contraindications to MRI should undergo head CT and CT angiography (CTA), which can be used to detect basilar artery occlusions.</p><p>Head CT and T2*-weighted gradient echo MRI (often called susceptibility-weighted imaging) are the most sensitive techniques to detect intracranial hemorrhage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Other tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Electroencephalography (EEG) reactivity is not a reliable measure of consciousness in patients with locked-in syndrome (LIS) as reactivity can be absent in some cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/locked-in-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, the presence of alpha coma does help to distinguish diffuse cerebral injuries such as the persistent vegetative state from LIS. In addition, a normal EEG in a patient who seems unresponsive suggests either LIS or psychogenic coma, so it can be helpful.</p><p>Somatosensory evoked potentials have variable patterns and thus show no specific characteristics in LIS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/locked-in-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Brainstem auditory evoked potentials are normal when brainstem lesions do not involve auditory pathways, as can be the case in LIS.</p><p>A lumbar puncture is warranted to consider inflammatory and infectious causes such as encephalitis if MRI does not reveal a structural cause in patients with possible LIS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When immobile patients do not respond to queries or directions, the differential diagnosis includes locked-in syndrome (LIS), coma, persistent vegetative state, akinetic mutism, catatonia, and psychogenic unresponsiveness (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F65484\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65484 \">table 1</a>). Is the patient not responding because of paralysis with retained consciousness (LIS), reduced consciousness and awareness (stupor or coma), wakefulness without awareness (persistent vegetative state), or a psychiatric disorder (catatonia or psychogenic unresponsiveness)? (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stupor-and-coma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stupor and coma in adults&quot;</a>).</p><p>The essential criteria to make a diagnosis of LIS are paralysis with intact awareness and cognitive function. Comatose patients do not open or move the eyes, respond to voice or noxious stimuli, or move the limbs. The patient with LIS uses vertical eye movements and blinking to follow complex linguistic requests.</p><p>Since control of eye movements rests in the medial tegmentum of the brainstem, examination of eye movement function is an important key to differential diagnosis.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What is the position of the eyes at rest? An ocular skew may indicate damage to the brainstem.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are there spontaneous roving eye movements? This finding is often caused by bilateral cerebral hemisphere disease due to bilateral strokes or metabolic or toxic disorders.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is there bobbing of the eyes downward? This finding suggests a pontine lesion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Can the patient open the eyes and look up and down? Preserved vertical eye movements indicate intact midbrain function.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are doll's eyes movement in the horizontal and vertical positions preserved? In coma due to brainstem lesions, horizontal eye movements are lost and vertical eye movements are often spared.</p><p/><p>In akinetic mutism, patients lack drive and motivation to move and speak spontaneously. Maintenance of body posture is a distinguishing feature of catatonia.</p><p>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is another central cause of LIS in which oculomotor function is spared, but ALS causes gradual weakness and does not present acutely. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-of-amyotrophic-lateral-sclerosis-and-other-forms-of-motor-neuron-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and other forms of motor neuron disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Purely peripheral conditions that may have clinical features similar to LIS include severe polyneuropathy, such as acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy (AIDP, also known as Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome), neuromuscular disorders, such as myasthenia gravis and critical illness <span class=\"nowrap\">neuropathy/myopathy,</span> and pharmacologic neuromuscular blockade. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=guillain-barre-syndrome-in-adults-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome in adults: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-myasthenia-gravis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of myasthenia gravis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuromuscular-weakness-related-to-critical-illness\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuromuscular weakness related to critical illness&quot;</a>.)</p><p>While these neuromuscular disorders may cause profound diffuse limb weakness, it is rare for any of them to cause complete bulbar and limb paralysis. Either speech or some limb motion is typically spared, permitting communication or signaling. The past history and gradual development of paralysis almost always allows identification of a peripheral neuromuscular problem.</p><p>Toxic-metabolic encephalopathies and the presence of sedative, analgesic, or psychotropic drugs must all be considered and ruled out when the patient is unresponsive and imaging does not support a structural cause. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-delirium-and-confusional-states\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of delirium and confusional states&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stupor-and-coma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stupor and coma in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although early literature suggested that locked-in syndrome (LIS) was an irreversible condition leading to death shortly after onset [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/locked-in-syndrome/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>], accumulating evidence suggests that a substantial proportion regain some function over time, and a minority have a good functional recovery. However, most survivors of LIS remain chronically locked-in or severely impaired.</p><p>Case studies described patients who recovered from LIS anywhere from 30 minutes to several weeks after onset. In these cases, the causes of LIS were brainstem ischemia, encephalitis, and trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/locked-in-syndrome/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. One report described four patients with LIS due to presumed basilar artery occlusion who made substantial functional gains over several months while receiving supportive therapy and rehabilitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/locked-in-syndrome/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. These patients recovered to independence in at least some activities of daily living; they regained bowel and bladder control, could eat by mouth, and regained functional, although dysarthric, speech.</p><p>Few large-scale studies have evaluated the extent of recovery and mortality of patients with LIS. In the largest published review of 139 cases, the mortality rate was 60 percent, and most of the deaths (87 percent) occurred within the first four months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/locked-in-syndrome/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The most common causes of death were pneumonia, pulmonary embolism, extension of brainstem lesions, and sepsis. Patients with LIS due to nonvascular etiologies (eg, trauma) had lower mortalities and faster and more complete recoveries compared with patients with LIS due to vascular causes, mainly pontine infarction. However, functional recovery was generally good in those patients with a vascular etiology who survived beyond four months.</p><p>The most extensive longitudinal evidence comes from a cohort of 27 patients with LIS who were locked-in for over a year; the first report from this cohort was an observational study published in 1987 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/locked-in-syndrome/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Mean survival was 4.9 years, and ranged from 1.2 years to 12.8 years by study completion. The majority of the survivors were at home, while some lived in nursing homes or acute care hospitals. Eleven patients never moved their limbs or head, six had minor movements, and 10 could trigger a switch, point, or type. Seven patients could use an electric wheelchair.</p><p>Many patients in this series achieved bowel and bladder continence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/locked-in-syndrome/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. All except for seven ate food by mouth. Eight patients (29 percent) could consistently answer questions appropriately but had learning difficulties. Some of those patients had extrapontine hemorrhages or traumatic injury. Sixteen patients (59 percent) recovered the ability to cry involuntarily or speak words and sentences. All except for three patients communicated with gestures, limb movements, a letter board, or electronic equipment.</p><p>Almost all of the patients in this series developed typical complications of chronic assisted care including urinary tract infections, pneumonia, pressure sores, gastrointestinal bleeding, and deep venous thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/locked-in-syndrome/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Many of these medical problems were attributed to indwelling urinary catheters, gastrostomy tubes, and tracheostomies, although there were insufficient patient numbers to ascertain a statistical association between medical complications and these devices.</p><p>In a subsequent report published in 1992 by the same investigators, who added two further patients, survival ranged from 2 to 18 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/locked-in-syndrome/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. A telephone survey published in 2003 found that from the original cohort of 29 patients, 16 had died in the interim. Overall survival rates at 10 and 20 years were 83 percent and 40 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/locked-in-syndrome/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. This is one of the few studies to date showing that some LIS patients survive for a decade or more.</p><p>In another study, among 11 patients with LIS followed anywhere from seven months to 10 years, four (36 percent) achieved good functional outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/locked-in-syndrome/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. All of the patients could manipulate a digital switch, and some used electric wheelchairs and computers for communication. Recovery tended to progress distally and spread proximally along the axial musculature.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Quality of life</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is limited information on the quality of life or emotional state of patients with LIS.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A psychological analysis of seven long-term survivors found that their quality of life was worse than cancer patients but better than the terminally ill; all scored in the range of a depressive illness, and four had contemplated suicide. All, however, wanted life-sustaining treatments including antibiotics for pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/locked-in-syndrome/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a retrospective survey cited above involving 13 survivors with LIS (from an initial cohort of 29) or their caregivers, satisfaction with life was expressed by 7 patients, occasional depression was reported for 5 patients, euthanasia was never considered by 7, euthanasia was considered but refused by 6, and a wish to die was expressed by 1 patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/locked-in-syndrome/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. None had do not resuscitate (DNR) directives.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A subsequent case-control study compared 19 patients with LIS and 20 age-matched healthy control subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/locked-in-syndrome/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. There was no significant difference between the LIS group and healthy controls on scores assessing overall quality of life and mental health. However, the LIS group had significantly lower scores on measures of physical function, as might be expected. In addition, the LIS group had a significantly higher frequency of depressive symptoms.</p><p/><p>These studies underscore the need to screen for the development of and to address possible treatment for depression and suicidal ideation in LIS patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While there are no proven medical therapies that promote recovery from locked-in syndrome (LIS), care should be centralized and coordinated in a specialized rehabilitation center experienced in LIS. Multimodal therapy with physical and speech therapy and assistive devices to facilitate interaction may improve outcome. Supportive and preventative measures are of paramount importance for patients with LIS.</p><p>Patients with LIS are fully conscious and should be encouraged to participate in decisions affecting their care at all stages of treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Immediate therapies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The acute stage of treatment for locked-in syndrome (LIS) focuses on securing and maintaining an airway and ensuring adequate oxygenation.</p><p>Primary attention should be paid to rapidly identifying the vascular cause of LIS. For patients with LIS due to acute ischemic stroke (within 48 hours from onset or most recent deterioration) caused by vertebral or basilar artery embolism or thrombosis with persistent vascular occlusion, we suggest aggressive therapy aimed at recanalization, including intravenous or intraarterial thrombolysis. This recommendation is made because of the poor functional prognosis of brainstem stroke associated with LIS.

Accordingly, we favor chest physiotherapy, deep breathing exercises [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/locked-in-syndrome/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>], and chest mobilization to facilitate bronchial secretions.

Such communication devices have allowed patients to e-mail, use the internet, read daily news, write stories, compose music, and shop online [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/locked-in-syndrome/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Whatever form of communication is used, the method should be posted at the bedside.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The locked-in syndrome (LIS) is a rare catastrophic condition characterized by limb paralysis and loss of speech with retained consciousness, alertness, and cognition. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Definition and anatomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Locked-in syndrome is caused by destructive bilateral brainstem lesions affecting the corticospinal, corticopontine, and corticobulbar tracts. The most common cause is ischemic infarction of the ventral pons. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Quadriplegia and inability to speak or swallow with retained cognition are the hallmarks of LIS. Because the supranuclear ocular motor pathways are spared, patients can move their eyes and blink. Many patients with LIS retain some other voluntary movements such as horizontal gaze, facial expression, limb, head, or tongue movements. In addition, patients with LIS may have involuntary ocular, oral, or limb movements. Respiration is often affected. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Observation and examination of eye movements during bedside interaction is the key to making the diagnosis of LIS. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of LIS includes coma, persistent vegetative state, akinetic mutism, catatonia, and psychogenic unresponsiveness. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The acute stage of treatment for LIS focuses on securing and maintaining an airway, ensuring adequate oxygenation, and rapid identification and treatment of vascular causes. For patients with LIS due to acute ischemic stroke (within 48 hours from onset or most recent deterioration) caused by vertebral or basilar artery embolism or thrombosis with persistent vascular occlusion, we suggest aggressive therapy aimed at recanalization, including intravenous or intraarterial thrombolysis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). This recommendation is made because of the poor functional prognosis of brainstem stroke associated with LIS. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Immediate therapies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most survivors of LIS remain chronically locked-in or severely impaired. However, many regain some motor function over time, and a minority has a good functional recovery. For patients with LIS who indicate a desire for such therapy, we recommend aggressive multidisciplinary rehabilitation measures beginning within one month of onset, including intense physical, speech, and respiratory therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Subacute and chronic therapies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Supportive care for LIS should include identifying and treating reversible medical conditions such as infections and electrolyte abnormalities, inquiring about and treating patients' pain, and preventing immobility, contractures, corneal abrasions, and decubitus ulcers. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Subacute and chronic therapies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H630177006\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Sean Savitz, MD, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Dumas A.
