Red cell transfusion has significant risks, including volume overload, transmission of infectious agents, and various immunologic consequences including transfusion reactions. Many of these complications can be avoided with careful administration of red cell transfusions.</p><p>The administration and complications of red cell transfusion in infants and children will be reviewed here.

In general, the church is opposed to storage of blood for transfusion, but local groups and individuals within these groups take different positions about what kinds of hematologic support may be acceptable. In cases in which the child is placed at substantial medical risk because of parental nonconsent, court approval is often sought for transfusion.

High on this list is a hemolytic transfusion reaction due to a misidentified patient or specimen, which occurs with a frequency greater than that of transfusion-associated transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) or hepatitis C (HCV) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-infants-and-children-administration-and-complications/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemolytic-transfusion-reactions#H354742\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemolytic transfusion reactions&quot;, section on 'Acute hemolytic reactions'</a>.)</p><p>It is not uncommon to have two patients on the same hospital floor with the same last name but different blood types, both of whom require blood transfusion. As a result, all patients in the hospital, including children, should have armbands or similar methods of identification. These should be examined explicitly at the time specimens are drawn for blood bank testing, and again immediately before each unit of blood is transfused. Careful attention should be paid to the labeling requirements of specimens for the blood bank [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-infants-and-children-administration-and-complications/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Infusion pumps and catheter size</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ordinary infusion pumps or roller infusion devices can be used to administer red blood cell transfusions without risk of causing hemolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-infants-and-children-administration-and-complications/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, one practical concern in administering blood to children, particularly small infants, is the slow flow of blood products through small intravenous catheters. Blood under minimal pressure can be transfused through a 22 gauge catheter but will flow very slowly. Higher rates of flow can be achieved with pressure devices. Minimal hemolysis is caused by pressures of up to 300 mmHg and catheter sizes as small as 22 gauge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-infants-and-children-administration-and-complications/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Filters</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blood must always be administered through a filter to remove small aggregates and blood clots that may have formed during storage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-infants-and-children-administration-and-complications/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The usual filter is 170 to 260 microns. These devices do not provide leukoreduction.</p><p>Many blood centers in the United States and other countries have adopted a policy of &quot;universal leukoreduction,&quot; in which all RBC and apheresis platelet products are leukoreduced using a filtration process. Leukocyte reduction is usually performed in the blood bank or at the time of collection. Alternatively, a leukocyte reduction filter may be used at the bedside because of the small volumes of many pediatric transfusions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leukoreduction-to-prevent-complications-of-blood-transfusion#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Leukoreduction to prevent complications of blood transfusion&quot;, section on 'Pre-storage versus post-storage leukoreduction'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-infants-and-children-selection-of-blood-products#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell transfusion in infants and children: Selection of blood products&quot;, section on 'Leukoreduced RBCs'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Volume</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The volume of blood to be transfused varies with the clinical situation. The usual transfusion volume is 10 to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span>. Because infants have higher blood volume per kg as compared with children, they tend to need transfusion volumes on the higher end of this range to achieve the desired hemoglobin concentration. If the hematocrit in the selected red cell product is approximately 65 percent, this volume will usually raise the hemoglobin concentration by 2 to 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> or the hematocrit by 6 to 9 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-infants-and-children-administration-and-complications/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

More rapid infusion is appropriate when there is acute blood loss resulting in compromised tissue perfusion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trauma-management-approach-to-the-unstable-child#H27380186\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trauma management: Approach to the unstable child&quot;, section on 'Blood products'</a>.) </p><p>If the transfusion will take longer than four hours because of slow flow or other issues, the blood bank can divide the unit into smaller aliquots so that each can be transfused within four hours. In special circumstances, such as for the operating room or a remote clinic, the blood bank may issue red cell units in coolers that have been validated to maintain the appropriate storage temperature.</p><p>A transfusion rate of approximately 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per hour usually avoids circulatory overload. Thus, a transfusion of 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> of packed red cells usually is transfused over a four-hour period. Patients deemed to be at risk for volume overload (such as those with impaired cardiac function) can be transfused at a slower rate of 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per hour. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Circulatory overload'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Compatible fluids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blood should be transfused only in the presence of compatible fluids. Incompatible products may cause red cell hemolysis or impair the anticoagulant properties of standard solutions used for red cell products.</p><p>No fluid should be administered with blood unless it has been specifically labeled and tested for this use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-infants-and-children-administration-and-complications/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The most compatible solution is isotonic (0.9 percent) saline. If a single line is being used, the tubing should be flushed carefully before and after blood administration if a potentially incompatible fluid has been infused. </p><p>Many drugs and solutions are completely incompatible with red cells, including the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypotonic solutions (including five percent aqueous dextrose and five percent dextrose in 0.225 percent saline), because they can cause hemolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-infants-and-children-administration-and-complications/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ringer's lactate solutions or other calcium-containing solutions, because calcium in these products reverses the anticoagulation in the RBC preparation which causes clotting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-infants-and-children-administration-and-complications/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood warmers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Red cells are preserved in the blood bank at 1 to 6&ordm;C. For a slow transfusion, this temperature may not pose a problem. However, the use of a blood warmer is recommended in the following clinical settings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unstable infants</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who require rapid transfusion of a large amount of blood (&gt;15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg/hour)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who require exchange transfusions</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with cold agglutinin disease</p><p/><p>If the blood requires warming, it is warmed at the time of transfusion using an approved and calibrated device. These devices must be monitored, since excessive warming can cause hemolysis. Blood should never be warmed in an uncontrolled way. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Exchange transfusion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Red cell exchange can be performed with an automated apheresis instrument, unless the patient is very small. The automated controls of these instruments are quite accurate in providing the desired target hemoglobin value, and their utility has been demonstrated in a number of studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-infants-and-children-administration-and-complications/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. Red cell priming of the instrument is recommended if the extracorporeal volume is more than 10 to 15 percent of the estimated total blood volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-infants-and-children-administration-and-complications/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The instrument should be primed with red cells, for example, in small children (body weight &lt;10 to 20 kg) or patients with severe anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-infants-and-children-administration-and-complications/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Most instruments require two sites of vascular access for draw and return; this can be problematic in children who have poor venous access. In emergent settings, double lumen central catheters, commonly used for hemodialysis, can be placed in the femoral vein. For long-term venous access for repeated exchanges, a surgically-created fistula or surgically implanted central venous catheter may be required.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Undesirable sequelae of transfusion may be divided into infectious and noninfectious categories. Although the public has focused on infectious risks, the noninfectious risks of transfusion, primarily transfusion reactions, have become more frequent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-infants-and-children-administration-and-complications/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>The following is a brief review of the different complications from blood transfusions, each of which is discussed in detail elsewhere.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All donated blood is extensively screened for transfusion-transmitted infections; as a result, the risk of acquiring infection is extremely low (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F69661\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69661 \">table 1</a>). Each unit of blood administered in the United States is screened for a number of infections, including HIV, hepatitis B and C viruses, human T-cell leukemia virus, West Nile virus, Trypanosoma cruzi, and Treponema pallidum.</p><p>Residual risk remains largely from &quot;window period&quot; donations, during the time when antigen <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> antibody are of such low level as to be undetectable by current techniques. A more complete discussion on the screening for transfusion-transmitted infection is found elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-donor-screening-laboratory-testing#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blood donor screening: Laboratory testing&quot;, section on 'Infectious disease screening'</a>.)</p><p>The risk of bacterial contamination of blood products is much greater than the risk of viral transmission. Bacterial contamination of blood products can occur at the time of collection or because the donor had occult bacteremia at the time of donation. Temperature elevation, hypotension, or other signs of sepsis should be investigated carefully in a patient who has received a transfusion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-donor-screening-medical-history#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blood donor screening: Medical history&quot;, section on 'Bacterial infection'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transfusion-transmitted-bacterial-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transfusion-transmitted bacterial infection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other rare infectious transfusion risks in the United States include the parasites of malaria, Chagas disease, and babesiosis. Screening by history of blood donors, including geography, is used to reduce the risk of transfusion of any of the parasitic or prion diseases. In 2006, a test for Chagas disease was approved by the FDA. Although testing is not mandated, most blood suppliers have started screening for Chagas disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blood-donor-screening-medical-history\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blood donor screening: Medical history&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Transfusion reaction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transfusion reactions occur in approximately one percent of children who received RBC transfusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-infants-and-children-administration-and-complications/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>These reactions are briefly reviewed here and are discussed in greater detail elsewhere.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acute hemolytic reactions</strong> &ndash; Acute hemolytic transfusion reactions usually result from the mistransfusion of ABO-incompatible red cells. This complication is best prevented, rather than treated, by meticulous attention to patient and sample identification. Treatment is supportive. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Patient identification'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemolytic-transfusion-reactions#H354742\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemolytic transfusion reactions&quot;, section on 'Acute hemolytic reactions'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Delayed hemolytic reactions</strong> &ndash; Delayed hemolysis results when the patient produces an antibody days following a blood transfusion or by anamnestic response. It presents 2 to 10 days following transfusion as jaundice <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an unexpected fall in hemoglobin. A delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction is confirmed by repeat antibody screening of the patient's plasma, which demonstrates the presence of a specific alloantibody that was not previously present. Positive direct antiglobulin test for IgG with a positive eluate against the corresponding antigen will confirm the diagnosis. Among many red cell antibodies, anti-Jka and anti-Jkb are known to cause delayed hemolysis more often than other antibodies. Subsequent red cell transfusions should utilize blood that tests negative for the newly identified antigen. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemolytic-transfusion-reactions#H354791\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hemolytic transfusion reactions&quot;, section on 'Delayed hemolytic reactions'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Febrile reactions</strong> &ndash; Febrile reactions not due to hemolysis are usually related to the presence of cytokines produced by passenger leukocytes. Treatment includes stopping the transfusion and excluding a hemolytic reaction or sepsis as the cause of fever. Antipyretic therapy is given for symptomatic relief. These reactions are reduced with leukoreduction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunologic-transfusion-reactions#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunologic transfusion reactions&quot;, section on 'Febrile nonhemolytic reactions'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=red-blood-cell-transfusion-in-infants-and-children-selection-of-blood-products#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Red blood cell transfusion in infants and children: Selection of blood products&quot;, section on 'Leukoreduced RBCs'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Allergic and anaphylactic reactions</strong> &ndash; An anaphylactic, allergic, or anaphylactoid reaction to a blood transfusion can vary in severity from mild hives and itching to fatal anaphylaxis. While more common with plasma and platelet transfusions, these reactions also may occur following red cell transfusion. Treatment is supportive. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunologic-transfusion-reactions#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunologic transfusion reactions&quot;, section on 'Urticarial (allergic) reactions'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Transfusion-associated lung injury</strong> &ndash; The presence of transfusion-associated acute lung injury (TRALI) should be suspected when dyspnea, bilateral noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, hypotension, and fever occur within six hours of completion of transfusion. TRALI is the leading cause of transfusion-related mortality in the United States. It is due primarily to the interaction between leukocytes from the recipient and anti-HLA antibodies or antigranulocyte antibodies from the donor. Treatment is supportive. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transfusion-related-acute-lung-injury-trali\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Circulatory overload</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO) may occur in children, although it is more common in adults. Manifestations may begin near the end or within six hours of the transfusion. Patients should be monitored closely during this time period for suggestive signs and symptoms, including dyspnea, orthopnea, tachycardia, and a wide pulse pressure, often with hypertension. The symptoms of TACO are similar to those of TRALI. Distinguishing features are as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TACO usually is associated with transfusion of a large volume of blood or a high rate of infusion; TRALI may occur with relatively small volumes at a slow rate.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypertension is commonly seen in TACO but is uncommon in TRALI.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever is typically absent in TACO whereas TRALI is often associated with fever.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) is often elevated in patients with TACO whereas it may be normal in TRALI.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with TACO usually responds well to diuretic therapy; the response to diuretic therapy in patients with TRALI is variable.</p><p/><p>Patients deemed to be at risk for volume overload (such as those with impaired cardiac function) can be transfused at a slower rate and diuretic therapy (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">furosemide</a> 0.5 to 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per dose) may be used as a prophylactic measure <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> for treatment of symptoms.

To reduce the risk of TA-GVHD in patients requiring red blood cell transfusion, it is important to consider the immune status of the child and use irradiated products if indicated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F81912\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81912 \">table 2</a>). Patients who are at risk for TA-GVHD include premature, low birth weight infants, infants and children with primary immunodeficiencies, organ transplant recipients, and patients receiving chemotherapy or other immunosuppressive therapy.

As an example, the main cause of death in patients with thalassemia major is heart failure or fatal arrhythmia due to deposition of transfused iron in the heart. Children who are at risk for iron overload can be treated with iron chelation therapy. Iron chelation therapy can reduce the damage produced by the life-long need for red cell transfusions in these children. In addition, exchange transfusion rather than simple transfusion has been used in children with sickle cell disease, partly to reduce the risk of iron overload.

To avoid volume overload, the transfusion should be given slowly, at approximately 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg/hour</span> (10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> over four hours). If the transfusion will take longer than four hours because of slow flow or other issues, the blood bank can issue the transfusion in smaller aliquots so that each can be given over less than four hours.
