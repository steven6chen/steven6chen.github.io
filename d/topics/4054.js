The exact incidence and variation in incidence with geography have not been well characterized.</p><p>Patients present at a median age of 36 years (range 9 to 79 years) with approximately 20 percent of patients presenting under the age of 20 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-subcutaneous-panniculitis-like-t-cell-lymphoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. There appears to be a female predominance with a male:female ratio of 0.5.

Nodule diameter can vary from 0.5 cm to more than 20 cm. Necrosis may be present, but ulceration is uncommon (6 percent). Single lesions are rare and approximately 80 percent of patients have multiple nodules <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> plaques.</p><p>The lesions may have been previously misdiagnosed as panniculitis or other cutaneous diseases, resulting in one series in a median time from lesion development to diagnosis of seven months (range one month to 10 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-subcutaneous-panniculitis-like-t-cell-lymphoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. It is not uncommon for these nodules to initially demonstrate a waxing and waning course and the development of new nodules at different sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-subcutaneous-panniculitis-like-t-cell-lymphoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Given this course, nodules may be seen in various stages of growth and healing, resulting in the presence of lipoatrophy in previously involved areas that have since regressed.</p><p>It is extremely unusual for patients with SPTCL to have evidence of lymphoma outside of the subcutaneous tissue. Systemic B symptoms (fevers, night sweats, and weight loss) and bone marrow abnormalities are reported in approximately 60 and 20 to 30 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-subcutaneous-panniculitis-like-t-cell-lymphoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Bone marrow involvement by lymphoma is highly unusual; the most common bone marrow abnormality is hemophagocytosis.</p><p>In a series of 83 patients diagnosed according to the current definition of SPTCL, 14 (17 percent) had secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH, also called the hemophagocytic syndrome) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-subcutaneous-panniculitis-like-t-cell-lymphoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. HLH is an often fatal complication that may present with high fevers, maculopapular rash, failure to thrive, central nervous system symptoms, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, cytopenias, coagulopathy, abnormal liver function tests, or an extremely high serum ferritin. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-hemophagocytic-lymphohistiocytosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Approximately 45 percent of patients with SPTCL have laboratory abnormalities, the most common of which are anemia, leukopenia, thrombocytopenia, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> elevated liver function tests.

The neoplastic cells often surround, or rim, the individual fat cells and may invade the deeper dermis, surrounding the sweat glands <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hair follicles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-subcutaneous-panniculitis-like-t-cell-lymphoma/abstract/1,5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5,6</a>]. Fat necrosis and karyorrhexis are common. Vascular invasion is seen in some cases.</p><p>The neoplastic infiltrate may be comprised of small, medium, or large atypical cells.

The most important features pointing to the diagnosis are rimming of individual adipocytes by atypical lymphocytes with hyperchromatic nuclei, and demonstration of a cytotoxic T cell immunophenotype by immunohistochemistry, which usually shows expression of CD3, CD8, TCR beta, and cytotoxic granule proteins by the neoplastic cells. PCR-based tests for clonal <em>TCR</em> gene rearrangements may help to confirm the diagnosis.

However, subsequent studies have noted that patients with these two entities have different pathologic features and a significantly different prognosis. As a result, the current WHO classification system limits SPTCL to tumors expressing <span class=\"nowrap\">alpha/beta</span> T cell receptors. Tumors expressing <span class=\"nowrap\">gamma/delta</span> T cell receptors are now categorized as primary cutaneous <span class=\"nowrap\">gamma/delta</span> T cell lymphoma (TCL) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-subcutaneous-panniculitis-like-t-cell-lymphoma/abstract/2,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7</a>].

Like SPTCL, primary cutaneous ALCL expresses CD3 and cytotoxic molecules (TIA-1, granzyme B, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> perforin), but differs in virtually always expressing CD30 and often expressing CD4. T cell receptor genes are rearranged in both. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-cutaneous-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Lymphomatoid papulosis and secondary dermal spread of a systemic ALCL should also be considered in the differential diagnosis.

Similar to SPTCL, MF expresses CD3, does not express CD56 or demonstrate Epstein-Barr virus infection, and has clonally rearranged <em>TCR</em> genes. MF differs from SPTCL in that it is centered on the dermis and epidermis not the subcutaneous tissue, expresses CD4, and does not express CD8 or cytotoxic molecules (TIA-1, granzyme B, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> perforin).

SPTCL is characterized by a subcutaneous infiltrate of atypical lymphocytes that characteristically rim individual adipocytes and express CD3, CD8, the <span class=\"nowrap\">alpha/beta</span> T cell receptor, and cytotoxic granule proteins (granzyme B, T cell intracellular antigen [TIA]-1, and perforin) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F55385\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55385 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F82054\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82054 \">picture 1</a>).

The main factor associated with a poor prognosis is the presence of the hemophagocytic syndrome (HPS).
