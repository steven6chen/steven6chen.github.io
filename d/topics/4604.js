Dementia is the general term for a group of brain disorders that cause memory and thinking problems. CJD gets worse quickly and leads to death within several months of when the symptoms first start.</p><p>CJD happens most often in older adults. It is caused by abnormal proteins called &quot;prions&quot; that infect the brain.</p><p>There are different types of CJD. The more common type is called &quot;sporadic&quot; CJD, and in most cases the cause is unknown. In rare cases, people have gotten CJD after they had transplant surgery and got an infected organ. CJD is not spread by sneezing, coughing, or touching.</p><p>An even less common type of CJD, called &quot;variant&quot; CJD, can happen after people eat beef that is infected with the disease. (This is sometimes known as &quot;mad cow disease.&quot;) But thanks to new government rules, variant CJD almost never happens anymore.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18071780\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The 2 most common symptoms of CJD are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dementia, which is the medical term for trouble with concentration, memory, or thinking</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscle twitches or jerks, which doctors call &quot;myoclonus&quot;</p><p/><p>People with CJD also usually have other symptoms that can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Behavior changes</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mood changes, such as depression</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble walking or problems with balance</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleeping much more or much less than usual</p><p/><p>These symptoms are similar to those that happen with other, more common types of dementia, such as Alzheimer disease. But in CJD, the symptoms get worse much faster than in Alzheimer disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18071795\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Doctors usually do tests to make sure a person has CJD and not another condition. These tests can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An MRI of the brain &ndash; This is an imaging test that creates pictures of the brain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An EEG (or &quot;electroencephalogram&quot;) &ndash; An EEG is a test that measures electrical activity in the brain and records brain wave patterns (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F55691\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55691 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A lumbar puncture (sometimes called a &quot;spinal tap&quot;) &ndash; During this procedure, the doctor puts a thin needle into the lower back and removes a small amount of spinal fluid. Spinal fluid is the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. He or she will send the spinal fluid to a lab for tests.</p><p/><p>Doctors can usually tell if someone has CJD from the results of these tests. But the only test that can show for sure if someone has CJD is a brain biopsy. For a biopsy, a doctor removes a sample of brain tissue. Then another doctor looks at the tissue under a microscope. Most people do not need to have a brain biopsy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18071810\"><span class=\"h1\">How is Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sadly, there are no treatments that can stop or cure the disease. The dementia keeps getting worse, and all people with CJD die within several months after their symptoms start.</p><p>If needed, doctors sometimes prescribe medicines to help calm down a person's behavior or to help with the muscle jerks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18071825\"><span class=\"h1\">What if my family member has Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your family member has CJD, you need to make plans for the future. You need to make plans for his or her:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Living situation &ndash; If your family member lives alone, you need to make sure he or she is safe. When he or she can't live alone, you need to decide whether he or she will live at home with help, or move to a nursing home.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decision-making &ndash; Early on, your family member should choose a &quot;power of attorney.&quot; A power of attorney is someone who can make decisions (including medical decisions) for him or her when he or she is no longer able to.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Money &ndash; As the disease gets worse, your family member will be unable to manage his or her money.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Driving &ndash; If your family member still drives, talk with the doctor about when he or she should stop.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18071840\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dementia-including-alzheimer-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Dementia (including Alzheimer disease) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluating-memory-and-thinking-problems-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Evaluating memory and thinking problems (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=eeg-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: EEG (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=advance-directives-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Advance directives (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-care-during-advanced-illness-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medical care during advanced illness (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=dementia-including-alzheimer-disease-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Dementia (including Alzheimer disease) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
