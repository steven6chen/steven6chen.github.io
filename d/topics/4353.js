Indeed, the rate of target lesion revascularization is lowered by as much as 65 percent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-use-of-intracoronary-bare-metal-stents#H348519460\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical use of intracoronary bare metal stents&quot;, section on 'When to choose a BMS'</a>.)</p><p>All DES currently approved in the United States have the same general components, although they differ with respect to the stent platform, polymer, and antirestenotic drug type (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F65603\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65603 \">table 1</a>). Differences may be observed with respect to deliverability (ease of placement), efficacy (prevention of restenosis), and safety (rates of stent thrombosis and myocardial infarction).</p><p>The first two DES to be approved in the United States were the sirolimus-eluting stent (SES) in 2003 and paclitaxel-eluting stent (PES) in 2004. They are now often referred to as &quot;first generation&quot; DES. SES are no longer available in the United States and Europe and PES are infrequently used due to superiority of second generation stents. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-use-of-intracoronary-bare-metal-stents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical use of intracoronary bare metal stents&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In 2008, the zotarolimus-eluting stent (ZES) and the everolimus-eluting stent (EES) were approved for use and they are referred to as &quot;second generation&quot; DES. The ZES has undergone further modification with a change in polymer to modify pharmacokinetics and has largely replaced the earlier version. The newer DES have a stent platform of a cobalt-or platinum-chromium alloy and are thinner and more deliverable than the first generation DES. In addition, second generation DES are more biocompatible than first generation DES: They may generate less inflammatory response and have more rapid vessel endothelialization or healing. This biocompatibility and associated reduced inflammatory response is likely due to improvements in polymer technology and may translate into lower rates of myocardial infarction and stent thrombosis. However, despite this potential improvement in biocompatibility, the recommended duration of dual antiplatelet therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and a P2Y<sub>12</sub> receptor blocker is 12 months, similar to the first generation DES. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=long-term-antiplatelet-therapy-after-coronary-artery-stenting-in-stable-patients#H1840123222\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Long-term antiplatelet therapy after coronary artery stenting in stable patients&quot;, section on 'Summary and recommendations'</a>.)</p><p>This topic will review the studies that compared one DES to another and make recommendations for which DES to choose in patients for whom DES are chosen. The discussion of the choice between DES and bare metal stents is found elsewhere (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-use-of-intracoronary-bare-metal-stents#H348519460\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical use of intracoronary bare metal stents&quot;, section on 'When to choose a BMS'</a>). Other drug-eluting stents, including stents with polymers that are bioabsorbable, or fully bioresorbable stents, are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bioresorbable-polymer-or-scaffold-drug-eluting-coronary-artery-stents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bioresorbable polymer or scaffold drug-eluting coronary artery stents&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H71604313\"><span class=\"h1\">SIROLIMUS AND PACLITAXEL STENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sirolimus- and paclitaxel-eluting stents were the first commercially available intracoronary drug-eluting stents (DES) and are referred to as first generation stents. Neither the sirolimus-eluting stent (SES) nor the paclitaxel-eluting stent (PES) is used with any regularity in most of the United States, Europe, and Canada due to advances in stent platforms and polymer biocompatibility with the second generation DES, which led to better clinical outcomes with second generation stents, coupled with a decision by the manufacturer to discontinue production of SES. The studies of the SES and PES are relevant to the extent that they helped to establish the rates of clinically important outcomes against which newer stents can be compared. </p><p>A 2007 meta-analysis compared short-term outcomes with SES or PES using individual patient data from 16 randomized trials (8695 patients) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comparison-of-drug-eluting-intracoronary-stents/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], including the pivotal REALITY [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comparison-of-drug-eluting-intracoronary-stents/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], SIRTAX [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comparison-of-drug-eluting-intracoronary-stents/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], and SORT OUT II [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comparison-of-drug-eluting-intracoronary-stents/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] trials. During a mean follow-up of 9 to 37 months, SES reduced the primary end points of the risk of reintervention and stent thrombosis compared to PES (hazard ratio 0.74, 95% CI 0.63-0.87 and 0.66, 95% CI 0.46-0.94, respectively). The risks of death and MI were comparable between the two stents. These findings were confirmed in a second meta-analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comparison-of-drug-eluting-intracoronary-stents/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The best available data on long-term outcomes after SES or PES in patients with more complex lesions come from the SIRTAX LATE trial, which evaluated five-year clinical and angiographic outcomes of patients enrolled in the SIRTAX trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comparison-of-drug-eluting-intracoronary-stents/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Of the 1012 patients randomly assigned to SES or PES, clinical follow-up was available in 980 and repeat angiography was performed in 444 at five years. Comparing SES with PES, there was no significant difference in the rates of a composite primary end point, which included cardiac death, MI, and ischemia-driven target lesion revascularization (19.7 versus 21.4 percent), ischemia-driven target lesion revascularization (13.1 versus 15.1 percent), or definite or probable stent thrombosis using the Academic Research Consortium criteria (4.8 versus 4.9 percent).

While several important clinical trials with ZES were conducted using the Endeavor and resulted in United States Food and Drug Administration-approval of the ZES, the Resolute has largely replaced the former due to its improved drug release characteristics. The first zotarolimus-eluting stent (E-ZES, Endeavor) used a polymer that mimics the cell membrane phospholipid phosphorylcholine. Zotarolimus is eluted within a few weeks from the polymer, with 95 percent of drug released within about two weeks. To improve upon drug release kinetics and achieve a greater degree of inhibition of intimal hyperplasia, the ZES was redesigned with an alternative polymer, the proprietary BioLinx polymer. The second ZES, Resolute (R-ZES), has extended delivery of zotarolimus (85 percent within 60 days and the remainder by 180 days). Late lumen loss, a surrogate measure of restenosis, is lower with R-ZES. Although the initial studies of the E-ZES are informative, comparisons between E-ZES and other stent types cannot be generalized to the R-ZES. </p><p>The ENDEAVOR program compared E-ZES to bare metal stents, sirolimus-eluting stents (SES), and paclitaxel-eluting stents (PES).

E-ZES are inferior to SES and PES with respect to the angiographic finding of in-stent late loss. However, with respect to clinical outcomes, E-ZES has similar or better outcomes than PES. The data on clinical outcomes comparing ZES to SES is less definitive, although there appears to be similar or improved safety but higher rates of revascularization with E-ZES. </p><p>The following is a summary of the relevant trials of the first approved ZES (ENDEAVOR):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ENDEAVOR III trial evaluated the relative safety and efficacy of the E-ZES compared with SES in a 3:1 randomization in 436 patients with de novo coronary lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comparison-of-drug-eluting-intracoronary-stents/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].

Clinically-driven target lesion revascularization was also numerically higher for E-ZES at nine months (6.3 versus 3.5 percent). However, by three years, E-ZES was associated with a significantly lower rate of death or MI (3.9 versus 10.8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comparison-of-drug-eluting-intracoronary-stents/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SORT OUT III randomly assigned over 2300 patients to E-ZES or SES [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comparison-of-drug-eluting-intracoronary-stents/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].

The following findings were noted comparing these two stents, respectively:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No difference in the primary efficacy end point of target-vessel revascularization (risk ratio [RR] 1.06, 95% CI 0.90-1.24).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No difference in the primary safety point of definite or probable stent thrombosis (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.86-1.85).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No difference in the secondary end points of cardiac death or target-vessel myocardial infarction (RR 1.01 and 1.10, respectively).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2748442447\"><span class=\"h1\">DES UNDER INVESTIGATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite high rates of success with current generation DES, attempts to further reduce the risks of stent thrombosis and restenosis are warranted (see <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above).</p><p>A novel, cobalt alloy-based stent with a durable elastomeric polymer eluting the antiproliferative agent ridaforolimus (a rapamycin derivative) was evaluated in the BIONICS trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comparison-of-drug-eluting-intracoronary-stents/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. In this study, 1944 patients with broad entry criteria were randomly assigned to either ridaforolimus-eluting stents or ZES. At 12 months, the primary end point (a composite of cardiac death, target vessel-related myocardial infarction, and target lesion revascularization) occurred in 5.4 percent of both groups. In addition, measures of late lumen loss were similar. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H139867991\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPARISON OF ALL DES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A 2012 mixed-treatment comparison meta-analysis of 76 randomized trials with over 100,000 patient-years of follow-up supports the conclusions of the individual studies (and their meta-analyses) presented above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comparison-of-drug-eluting-intracoronary-stents/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. This meta-analysis compares outcomes of any two drug-eluting stents (DES) (sirolimus-eluting stents [SES], paclitaxel-eluting stents [PES], everolimus-eluting stents [EES], Endeavor zotarolimus-eluting stents [E-ZES], or ZES-Resolute [R-ZES]) using direct data from randomized trials (that compare stent A to stent B) and indirect comparison using data from trials that compare stent A to stent C or compare stent B to stent C (such that stent A can then be indirectly compared to stent B). The mixed-treatment comparison has the potential to improve the precision of the estimate of effect that would be obtained from only a direct comparison. </p><p>This 2012 mixed-treatment comparison came to the following conclusions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With regard to the risk of target vessel revascularization at one year or less and long-term, SES, EES, and R-ZES were similar and had lower rates than PES or E-ZES.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With regard to the risk of death at one year or less and long-term, there was no significant difference between any pair of DES. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With regard to the risk of definite or probable stent thrombosis, EES had the lowest risk of any DES.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H139868021\"><span class=\"h1\">OUR APPROACH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following summarizes the information presented above:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Paclitaxel-eluting stents (PES) are inferior to all other drug-eluting stents (DES) for the combination of efficacy and safety.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sirolimus-eluting stents (SES) are no longer available in most locations. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Resolute zotarolimus-eluting stents (R-ZES) appear to be superior to Endeavor zotarolimus-eluting stents (E-ZES) for lowering the rate of target vessel revascularization.

They succeed by inhibiting the primary reason for BMS failure, restenosis due to neointimal hyperplasia. The comparison of DES to BMS is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-use-of-intracoronary-bare-metal-stents#H348519460\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical use of intracoronary bare metal stents&quot;, section on 'When to choose a BMS'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although all DES have the same general components, they differ with respect to the stent platform, polymer coating, and the antirestenotic drug type embedded into the polymer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F65603\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65603 \">table 1</a>). Since each DES is unique, differences are observed with respect to deliverability (ease of placement), efficacy (prevention of restenosis), and safety (rates of stent thrombosis or myocardial infarction). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sirolimus- and paclitaxel-eluting stents (sirolimus-eluting stents [SES] and paclitaxel-eluting stents [PES]) are referred to as first generation and everolimus- and zotarolimus-eluting stents (EES and ZES) are referred to as second generation DES. All DES are superior to BMS in terms of the rates of target lesion revascularization.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PES are inferior to second generation DES for both target vessel revascularization and safety issues, and SES are no longer manufactured due to market forces. There have been two iterations of the ZES (Endeavor and Resolute); manufacturing of the older Endeavor-ZES has stopped. Resolute zotarolimus-eluting stents (R-ZES) and EES have comparable efficacy and safety.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients undergoing intracoronary stenting with a DES, we recommend an EES, either with a durable or bioresorbable polymer (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>), or R-ZES (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>) rather than a PES. (See <a href=\"#H139868021\" class=\"local\">'Our approach'</a> above.) The choice between EES or R-ZES should be guided by issues such as cost, practitioner familiarity, and availability.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/comparison-of-drug-eluting-intracoronary-stents/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Sch&ouml;mig A, Dibra A, Windecker S, et al.
