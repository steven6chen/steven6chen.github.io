Secondary prevention of CVD, emerging risk factors, and determining individual risk of a patient without known CVD are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-cardiovascular-disease-events-in-those-with-established-disease-or-at-high-risk\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of cardiovascular disease events in those with established disease or at high risk&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-established-risk-factors-for-cardiovascular-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of established risk factors for cardiovascular disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiovascular-disease-risk-assessment-for-primary-prevention-our-approach\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiovascular disease risk assessment for primary prevention: Our approach&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">RATIONALE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the United States, since 1975, cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality has declined by 24 to 28 percent overall, among men and women as well as black and whites, although men and blacks continue to experience far higher absolute mortality rates, especially at earlier ages, than their female and white counterparts. Further, the rate of decline has slowed since 1990 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-primary-prevention-of-coronary-heart-disease-and-stroke/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. It has been estimated that nearly half of the decline is due to earlier diagnosis and more aggressive treatment, especially of lipids and blood pressure and, particularly, with adjunctive drug therapies of life saving benefit, which include statins, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and beta blockers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-primary-prevention-of-coronary-heart-disease-and-stroke/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The remaining half of the decline in CVD mortality is attributable to favorable changes in therapeutic lifestyle changes, such as avoidance and cessation of cigarette smoking.</p><p>Despite these remarkable declines, however, CVD remains the leading cause of death in the United States and has also become so worldwide. While continued improvement in diagnosis is desirable, modification of risk factor modification is a necessity. In descriptive data from a nationally representative survey, useful to formulate but not test hypotheses, five modifiable risk factors for CVD (elevated cholesterol, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and smoking) accounted for one-half of CVD deaths in United States adults aged 45 to 79 from 2009 to 2010 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-primary-prevention-of-coronary-heart-disease-and-stroke/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The preventable fraction of CVD mortality associated with these risk factors was 54 percent for men and 50 percent for women.</p><p>The majority of the risk factors for CVD and stroke are modifiable by preventive measures, including therapeutic lifestyle changes and adjunctive drug therapies of proven benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-primary-prevention-of-coronary-heart-disease-and-stroke/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In the descriptive INTERHEART study of patients from 52 countries, nine potentially modifiable factors accounted for over 90 percent of the population attributable risk of a first myocardial infarction (MI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-primary-prevention-of-coronary-heart-disease-and-stroke/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. These included cigarette smoking, dyslipidemia, hypertension, diabetes, abdominal obesity, and psychosocial factors. In addition, factors that were associated with lowered risks included regular physical activity, daily consumption of fruits and vegetables, and daily consumption of small amounts of alcohol, which is likely to be about one drink for women and two for men.</p><p>The potential benefits of primary prevention strategies hypothesized from descriptive studies have been tested in analytic studies, including large prospective cohort studies that are useful to test hypothesis of moderate to large effects. For example, in the Nurses' Health Study of over 120,000 female nurses followed for over 20 years, women who maintained a desirable body weight, ate a healthy diet, exercised regularly, and did not smoke cigarettes experienced an 84 percent reduction in their risk of clinical CVD events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-primary-prevention-of-coronary-heart-disease-and-stroke/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The observation that only 3 to 5 percent of these dedicated and conscientious health professionals were in the lowest risk category reinforces the major clinical challenges in primary prevention. For lower-risk women in the Women's Health Study of almost 40,000 equally dedicated and conscientious female health professionals whose 10-year risk of a first coronary heart disease (CHD) event was only 2.5 percent, those practicing therapeutic lifestyle changes had a 55 percent lower risk of stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-primary-prevention-of-coronary-heart-disease-and-stroke/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>The following major risk factors for CVD are modifiable and should be considered in all adults:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Smoking </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Overweight and obesity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unhealthy diet</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical inactivity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dyslipidemia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypertension</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diabetes mellitus (considered in some guidelines as a CHD risk equivalent)</p><p/><p>The deleterious consequences of multiple risk factors are, at least, additive. In the Framingham Heart Study of over 5000 men and women, those with five risk factors had a 10-year risk of a first CHD event of 25 to 30 percent, which is comparable to the absolute risk of many patients who have survived a prior MI or occlusive stroke (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F55353\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55353 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-primary-prevention-of-coronary-heart-disease-and-stroke/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>In addition, several large-scale primary prevention trials and their meta-analyses demonstrate that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> reduces the risk of a first MI in apparently healthy individuals at low risk for a first event. The use of aspirin for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease is discussed in detail elsewhere.

It is possible that the apparent benefit may be due to specific compounds in vegetables and fruits. It is also likely that people who eat more vegetables and fruits tend to eat less meat and saturated fat. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=healthy-diet-in-adults#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Healthy diet in adults&quot;, section on 'Mediterranean diet'</a>.)</p><p>Basic research has suggested mechanisms of benefit, and observational studies have shown that individuals who self-select for diets high in antioxidant vitamins or supplements have lower risks. Nonetheless, the most reliable data from large-scale randomized trials have not shown significant benefits of antioxidant vitamin supplementation in the primary prevention of CVD.

Overweight and obesity increase several major and modifiable risk factors for CVD, including hypertension, dyslipidemia, and insulin resistance as well as diabetes. Data from large prospective cohort studies have consistently shown that individuals with higher body weights have a linear increase in morbidity and mortality from CHD, after proper adjustment for other risk factors.

In some, but not the majority of analytic studies, individuals who consume red wine tend to have lower risks than those who consume other types of alcohol. This inconsistent finding may be due to other components in red wine or confounding by social class.
