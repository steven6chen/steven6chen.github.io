There, cortisol is reduced, oxidized, or hydroxylated, and the products of these reactions are made water soluble by conjugation with sulfate or glucuronic acid to facilitate their excretion in urine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F79190\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79190 \">figure 1</a>).

The enzyme's substrate specificities suggest a primary role in bile acid synthesis rather than cortisol metabolism but no other gene encoding an enzyme with 5-beta-reductase activity has been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metabolism-of-adrenal-steroids/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] and detailed studies of a 13-year-old patient with a homozygous missense mutation in <em>AKR1D1</em> revealed nearly total absence of 5-beta reduced metabolites of cortisol and cortisone in urine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metabolism-of-adrenal-steroids/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

It is constitutively expressed in liver, adipose tissue, bone, and central nervous system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metabolism-of-adrenal-steroids/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>] but is also inducible in a variety of other tissues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metabolism-of-adrenal-steroids/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. While the enzyme has the capacity to inactivate cortisol by oxidation, the reverse (reductase) reaction (ie, conversion of cortisone to cortisol) normally predominates in the liver in vivo.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The reductase directionality of 11-beta-HSD 1's catalysis is determined by the co-expression of an NADPH-generating system, hexose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, which maintains a reducing environment within the endoplasmic reticulum where 11-beta-HSD 1 is localized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metabolism-of-adrenal-steroids/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. In normal subjects, urinary 11-keto (cortisone) metabolites are slightly more abundant than 11-hydroxy (cortisol) metabolites.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Oxidation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cortisol and its metabolites are also oxidized in the liver. Oxidative removal of the C20, C21 side chain yields a C19 steroid with a 17-ketone group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metabolism-of-adrenal-steroids/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Available evidence indicates that this side chain cleavage is not carried out by CYP17, the enzyme that catalyzes this reaction in androgen biosynthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metabolism-of-adrenal-steroids/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The identity of the gene encoding this side chain cleavage enzyme activity is not known [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metabolism-of-adrenal-steroids/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Hydroxylation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>6-beta hydroxylation of cortisol occurs in the liver by the CYP3A4 enzyme, but only to a minor extent, with 6-beta-hydroxycortisol accounting for less than 3 percent of total urinary glucocorticoid metabolites. When serum cortisol concentrations are high, as in patients with Cushing's syndrome, disproportionately large amounts of 6-beta-hydroxycortisol may be produced and excreted in the urine, possibly because of saturation of the reduction and oxidation pathways but also perhaps because of induction of CYP3A4 by hypercortisolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metabolism-of-adrenal-steroids/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Conjugation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The C19 and C21 metabolites of cortisol are more water soluble when conjugated to glucuronic acid or sulfate, primarily the former. Glucuronidation is catalyzed by one of the uridine diphosphoglucuronosyl transferases, enzymes that catalyze the glucuronidation of xenobiotics, bilirubin, and steroids in the endoplasmic reticulum of the liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metabolism-of-adrenal-steroids/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Specific isoenzymes act on different substrates, even among the steroid hormones [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metabolism-of-adrenal-steroids/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Glucuronide may be conjugated to any hydroxyl group, but the 3-alpha-hydroxyl is preferred. Most tetrahydrocortisol derivatives are excreted in the urine as glucuronides.</p><p>Sulfation is catalyzed by cytosolic sulfotransferases. Only a small fraction of 3-alpha-hydroxysteroid metabolites, but most of the 3 beta-hydroxysteroids (both C19 and C21), are conjugated with sulfate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metabolism-of-adrenal-steroids/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. While these conjugation reactions have generally been considered as Phase II metabolic processes that follow reduction reactions, evidence now suggests that conjugated steroids may, in fact, serve as substrates for some aldo-keto-reductase enzymes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metabolism-of-adrenal-steroids/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Alterations in hepatic metabolism of cortisol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several factors and conditions are associated with altered hepatic metabolism of cortisol, including hormones, age, disease, obesity, and drugs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h4\">Hormones</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thyroid hormone alters cortisol metabolism. In patients with hyperthyroidism, cortisol clearance is accelerated, but serum cortisol concentrations are normal because of a compensatory increase in cortisol secretion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metabolism-of-adrenal-steroids/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Conversely, in patients with hypothyroidism, cortisol clearance is slowed and urinary excretion of cortisol metabolites is decreased, but serum cortisol concentrations still are normal. These changes in the rate of cortisol secretion occur because the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is normal, and changes in serum cortisol concentrations elicit compensatory changes in the secretion of corticotropin (ACTH). The effect of thyroid hormone is due largely to an increase in hepatic 5-alpha- and 5-beta-reductase activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metabolism-of-adrenal-steroids/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are some differences in cortisol metabolism between men and women.

Hormonal changes of the menstrual cycle do not appear to influence cortisol metabolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metabolism-of-adrenal-steroids/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

Glucocorticoids also stimulate hepatic 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase activity, while insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) inhibit it [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metabolism-of-adrenal-steroids/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperinsulinemia accompanying states of insulin resistance is associated with increases in 5-alpha-reductase activity (presumably hepatic) as assessed by urinary excretion of 5-alpha reduced metabolites of cortisol.

With progression to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), 11-beta-HSD 1 activity was increased in comparison with both patients with steatosis and controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metabolism-of-adrenal-steroids/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cortisol metabolism is dramatically altered in critically ill patients with a wide variety of underlying diagnoses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metabolism-of-adrenal-steroids/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. While cortisol levels are increased under the stress of such severe illness, ACTH is only transiently elevated in this setting, and the increase in cortisol levels has been attributed to adrenal stimulation by cytokines released during systemic inflammatory responses. In addition, however, diminished clearance of cortisol through enzymatic inactivation by 5-alpha- and 5-beta-reductases and by 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 appears to contribute to the increase in plasma cortisol.

There, cortisol is converted to cortisone by the high-affinity, NAD-dependent form (type 2) of 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase that is encoded by a gene on chromosome 16q22 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metabolism-of-adrenal-steroids/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>]. This conversion reduces cortisol access to the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metabolism-of-adrenal-steroids/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>], which otherwise binds cortisol and aldosterone with equal affinity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metabolism-of-adrenal-steroids/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Restricting cortisol access to MR therefore allows aldosterone to exert its physiologic effects. Genetic or pharmacologic impairment of 11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 results in cortisol-mediated mineralocorticoid effects.

The uridine diphosphoglucuronosyl transferase enzymes in these tissues metabolize primarily androgens and estrogens, but these and other enzymes that metabolize glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids presumably are found in their target tissue cells and may play an important role in terminating steroid hormone action.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">ALDOSTERONE METABOLISM</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Reduction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aldosterone, like cortisol, is reduced predominantly by a hepatic delta-4,3-ketosteroid-reductase, and a 3-alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F79190\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79190 \">figure 1</a>). The cytosolic delta-4-reductase also has 5-beta-hydroxysteroid reductase activity, so that the major metabolic product is 3-alpha, 5-beta-tetrahydroaldosterone. This metabolite, in the form of tetrahydroaldosterone glucuronide, accounts for 35 to 40 percent of the aldosterone metabolites in urine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metabolism-of-adrenal-steroids/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. A 21-deoxy form of tetrahydroaldosterone is further reduced to the 20-alpha-hydroxy form [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metabolism-of-adrenal-steroids/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. The 20-alpha-hydroxyl group can condense with the hydroxyl of the C18 hemiacetal to form an aldosterone metabolite with hemiacetal rings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metabolism-of-adrenal-steroids/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Conjugation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tetrahydroaldosterone is conjugated to glucuronic acid in the liver at the 3-keto position, and tetrahydroaldosterone glucuronide is the major urinary metabolite of aldosterone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metabolism-of-adrenal-steroids/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. Another conjugate, aldosterone-18-glucuronide, is produced by direct conjugation of unreduced aldosterone and accounts for approximately 10 percent of the aldosterone metabolites excreted in the urine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metabolism-of-adrenal-steroids/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Alterations in aldosterone metabolism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with cirrhosis and ascites, the production rate and serum concentration of aldosterone are often high as a result of increased plasma renin activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metabolism-of-adrenal-steroids/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. The ability of the liver to metabolize aldosterone is impaired, so a greater fraction is metabolized extrahepatically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metabolism-of-adrenal-steroids/abstract/74,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">74,75</a>]. Patients with severe congestive heart failure and impaired perfusion of the liver also have impaired aldosterone metabolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metabolism-of-adrenal-steroids/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. Treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spironolactone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">spironolactone</a> results in inhibition of the enzyme responsible for 18-glucuronidation of aldosterone. The elevated aldosterone levels observed in spironolactone-treated subjects may reflect, at least in part, this inhibition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metabolism-of-adrenal-steroids/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">ADRENAL ANDROGEN METABOLISM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The steroid produced in greatest quantity by the adrenal cortex and its major C19 androgenic product is dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and its sulfate ester (DHEA sulfate [DHEAS]). Most of the DHEA is converted to androstenedione by oxidation of the 3-beta-hydroxyl group and isomerization of the delta-5 double bond to the delta-4 position. Androstenedione is reduced by 5-alpha-reductase to androsterone and by 5-beta-reductase to etiocholanolone, which are then reduced by 17-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase to yield the respective -diol derivatives, followed by conjugation and excretion in the urine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metabolism-of-adrenal-steroids/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>DHEAS can be directly excreted in the urine; the sulfate group can be hydrolyzed to yield free DHEA, which is metabolized as just described, or DHEAS can be metabolized by 16- or 17-hydroxylation or by reversible 17-beta-reduction to yield androstenediol sulfate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metabolism-of-adrenal-steroids/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. DHEAS and its metabolites are cleared more slowly from serum by the kidney than their nonsulfated analogues [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metabolism-of-adrenal-steroids/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. Fecal excretion of DHEA and its metabolites is quantitatively more important than for other steroids; 30 to 45 percent of the metabolites of DHEAS may be excreted via the biliary tract and appear in the feces [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/metabolism-of-adrenal-steroids/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].
