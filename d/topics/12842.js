Hippocrates counseled clinicians not to treat patients who were &ldquo;overmastered by their disease.&rdquo; The idea that doctors should not recommend or provide treatments that could not help a patient has been a part of most codes of medical ethics for centuries.</p><p>Modern controversies about medical futility arise when doctors and patients (or family members) disagree about whether a particular treatment is futile or <span class=\"nowrap\">inappropriate/inadvisable</span> in a particular circumstance. Uncertainty about the appropriateness or benefit of interventions is a product of different perspectives on what constitutes benefit to patients and how individuals <span class=\"nowrap\">(patients/families</span> as well as clinicians) can vary dramatically in how they define value as related to life. Medical interventions can sustain organ function, thereby prolonging life. However, at times, the quality of that life (eg, lack of awareness of surroundings <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> inability to interact with surroundings without anticipated recovery) would lead many to determine that such a life lacks the quality or value warranting continued interventions to sustain it. In short, medical technological capacities collide with deeply ingrained moral and ethical beliefs and frameworks.</p><p>This topic review will cover the concept of medical futility as it applies to palliative care patients. Ethical issues related to futile and potentially inappropriate treatments that are specific to issues that arise in the intensive care unit from a critical care perspective are presented separately, as is a more extensive discussion of ethical issues that arise in palliative care. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethics-in-the-intensive-care-unit-responding-to-requests-for-potentially-inappropriate-therapies-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ethics in the intensive care unit: Responding to requests for potentially inappropriate therapies in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethical-issues-in-palliative-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ethical issues in palliative care&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8199187\"><span class=\"h1\">AUTONOMY AND MEDICAL FUTILITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The concept of patient autonomy emerged in the last half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. Prior to that, doctors would routinely make unilateral decisions about what treatments to offer and what to withhold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-medically-futile-and-potentially-inappropriate-therapies-of-questionable-benefit/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. There was no legal or (perceived) ethical need to discuss such decisions with patients or families. That began to change when the concept of &ldquo;informed consent&rdquo; became embedded in the law governing doctor-patient communication. To ensure informed consent, the doctor was required to explain the risks and benefits of treatment to patients and family members. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethical-issues-in-palliative-care#H1151880021\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ethical issues in palliative care&quot;, section on 'Framework for ethical reasoning'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=informed-procedural-consent\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Informed procedural consent&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The late 20<sup>th</sup> century also saw the invention and promulgation of life-sustaining medical technologies that enabled the prolongation of life in patients who were far too sick to survive without such technologies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-medically-futile-and-potentially-inappropriate-therapies-of-questionable-benefit/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. These technological developments were synergistic with the legal and ethical changes in medical practice described above in changing the landscape of medical ethics. There were more choices to be made, and there was more of a need to include patients and families in the decision-making process. </p><p>However, this had advantages and disadvantages. While patients and families were now allowed to discontinue treatment they deemed to be at odds with their goals, they were also allowed to request treatments that clinicians believed to be inappropriate or futile. In the 1980s and 1990s, reports began to be published of patients and families insisting on medical interventions that would not be able to achieve the ends of reversing death and sustaining meaningful life. Many began to argue that clinicians should be allowed to unilaterally withhold treatments that they considered futile or potentially inappropriate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-medically-futile-and-potentially-inappropriate-therapies-of-questionable-benefit/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Decisions in many of the early cases were made by courts of law.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8199193\"><span class=\"h2\">Representative cases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following three cases highlight the ways in which controversies about medical futility arose and were played out in the courts:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Helga Wanglie</strong> &ndash; Helga Wanglie was 86 years old when, in December 1989, she fell at home and broke her hip. After receiving care at the county hospital, she was discharged to a nursing home for rehabilitative care. There, she developed respiratory distress and was transferred back to the hospital where she was subsequently intubated and ventilated. She was unable to breathe on her own and remained on the ventilator for many months. She was transferred to another long-term care facility for chronic respiratory failure. During this time, she was conscious and aware of her environment. Ultimately, during attempts at weaning and separating from ventilation, she suffered a cardiopulmonary arrest with severe anoxic brain injury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">She was diagnosed as being in a persistent vegetative state (PVS). She underwent months of ongoing support with mechanical ventilation, gastrostomy feeds, and antibiotics for multiple recurrent infections. Her husband and children acknowledged the severity of her brain injury and recognized the medical view that this was irreversible.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The medical staff believed further care to not be in the best interest of Mrs. Wanglie. Her family believed that the medical staff should not &ldquo;play God&rdquo; and that stopping medical care would be against their religious views. Multiple family conferences were convened, and an ethics consult was obtained. The family eventually agreed to placement of a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order but did not want her removed from the ventilator or other treatments withheld. Medical staff and administration were in agreement about the ethics committee recommendation to stop interventions. The hospital and family sought another hospital to take over Mrs. Wanglie&rsquo;s care, which could not be achieved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-medically-futile-and-potentially-inappropriate-therapies-of-questionable-benefit/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The hospital requested that the family obtain a court order to continue care. When the family did not, the hospital filed a petition with the court. The court appointed Mr. Wanglie as his wife&rsquo;s guardian and supported his decision to continue care. The decision came three days before Mrs. Wanglie's death on July 4, 1991 at the age of 88 from sepsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-medically-futile-and-potentially-inappropriate-therapies-of-questionable-benefit/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Baby K</strong> &ndash; Stephanie Keene, referred to as Baby K during the ethical debates that surrounded her life, was an infant with the prenatal diagnosis of anencephaly, with a brainstem to maintain heart rate, blood pressure, and some respiratory effort, but no higher cognitive abilities. Her mother refused the recommendation to terminate the pregnancy on religious grounds, and Baby K was born on October 13, 1992.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Consistent with her underlying pathology, Baby K had significant respiratory insufficiency at birth and throughout her life. Her mother refused to place a DNR order as advised by medical staff. Baby K was on mechanical ventilator support for the first six weeks of life, during which time attempts were made to transfer her to another hospital, but no other facility would accept her. She was eventually weaned from the ventilator and transferred to a long-term care facility for other medical needs. However, she had continual episodes of respiratory distress for which she was frequently transferred back to the hospital for ventilator support. Baby K&rsquo;s mother insisted upon continued resuscitation and intubation. Baby K&rsquo;s father, who was not married to the mother, supported the hospital in its objections to ongoing resuscitation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The hospital filed a petition with the courts to appoint a guardian and to allow the hospital to provide only palliative care. The American Academy of Pediatrics wrote a brief in support of the hospital. The court gave a sweeping decision that in providing only palliative care against the wishes of the mother, the hospital would be in violation of multiple federal laws, including the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the Rehabilitation Act, as well as the mother&rsquo;s constitutional rights as protected by the 14<sup>th</sup> Amendment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-medically-futile-and-potentially-inappropriate-therapies-of-questionable-benefit/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The decision was affirmed by the federal court of appeals on only the basis of EMTALA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-medically-futile-and-potentially-inappropriate-therapies-of-questionable-benefit/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There was clear disagreement within the medical ethics community, with Dr. Michael Grodin, a pediatrician and head of the Program on Medical Ethics at the Boston University School of Medicine and Public Health, stating, &ldquo;For a baby that has no brain and is born dying, life for just another minute or another day is not an appropriate goal. It&rsquo;s saying that it&rsquo;s the technology that has life, not the patient.&rdquo; On the other hand, Dr. Robert M. Veatch, director of the Kennedy Institute of Ethics at Georgetown University, stated that the mother&rsquo;s and court&rsquo;s decision &ldquo;is well within the range of parental discretion.&rdquo; The discrepant opinions that surrounded this case reveal the heated debate over the concept of medical futility and how it is defined and applied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-medically-futile-and-potentially-inappropriate-therapies-of-questionable-benefit/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p>Notably, in both cases, the courts ruled in favor of family members advocating for continued medical intervention and against the medical providers who were arguing that such intervention was &lsquo;futile&rsquo; or not warranted due to the compromised state of the lives of the individual patients in question. On the other hand, the procedural posture in these cases was unique. Since almost all of these treatment conflicts concern inpatients, EMTALA is almost never as relevant as it was for Baby K. In Wanglie, the hospital asked the court to rule on the propriety of the surrogate instead of the propriety of the treatment itself.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Charlie Gard</strong> &ndash; Charlie Gard was born on August 6, 2016. At two months of age, he became lethargic and developed respiratory failure. He was admitted to the intensive care unit at Great Ormond Street Hospital (GOSH) in London and started on mechanical ventilation. He was eventually diagnosed with a mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome (MDDS), a rare clinically and genetically heterogeneous condition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-medically-futile-and-potentially-inappropriate-therapies-of-questionable-benefit/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. &#160; </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Through their own research, Charlie&rsquo;s parents discovered an experimental therapy called &ldquo;nucleoside therapy.&rdquo; They asked the doctors at GOSH to consider a trial of nucleoside therapy, and the physicians agreed, but then Charlie developed status epilepticus, suffering further brain damage; the doctors then concluded that nucleoside therapy would thus be futile, and they recommended withdrawal of life support. The parents requested instead that Charlie be transferred to the United States and to the care of a doctor who was willing to try nucleoside therapy. The doctors at GOSH thought that the treatment would be futile and thus transfer would not be in Charlie&rsquo;s best interest, and GOSH petitioned the United Kingdom High Court of Justice to allow Charlie&rsquo;s mechanical ventilation to be discontinued over the parents&rsquo; objections.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The High Court concluded that Charlie was suffering and therefore it was in his best interests to have life support withdrawn. The High Court judge also stressed that the decision was not based in any way on the cost of treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-medically-futile-and-potentially-inappropriate-therapies-of-questionable-benefit/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The parents appealed. Charlie&rsquo;s lawyers argued that even a small chance of benefit from a trial of therapy outweighed the potential harms. More importantly, they argued that the well-informed and caring parents, in collaboration with a doctor of their choice, should make the judgment about the balance of harms and benefits. The Court of Appeals upheld the High Court&rsquo;s opinion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-medically-futile-and-potentially-inappropriate-therapies-of-questionable-benefit/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The United Kingdom Supreme Court decided not to hear an appeal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-medically-futile-and-potentially-inappropriate-therapies-of-questionable-benefit/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. As a last resort, the parents appealed to the European Union Court of Human Rights. That court concluded that the decision to withdraw life support did not violate Charlie&rsquo;s human rights [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-medically-futile-and-potentially-inappropriate-therapies-of-questionable-benefit/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Eventually, the outside consultant came to agree that Charlie&rsquo;s disease had progressed to the point where therapy would no longer be beneficial. The parents gave up their fight, and Charlie was transferred to hospice, where he died.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">This case has implications for the process of shared decision making in such circumstances. Generally, when physicians disagree about the care of a child, we defer to parents and allow them to choose which physician&rsquo;s recommendations to follow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-medically-futile-and-potentially-inappropriate-therapies-of-questionable-benefit/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In the United States, this is true even in states such as Texas that permit unilateral physician decisions to withdraw life support [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-medically-futile-and-potentially-inappropriate-therapies-of-questionable-benefit/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Under Texas law, when doctors determine that further life support is inappropriate, parents are given 10 days to find another physician. If they do, their child will be transferred to the care of that physician [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-medically-futile-and-potentially-inappropriate-therapies-of-questionable-benefit/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In California, this was even true for a child who was declared brain dead [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-medically-futile-and-potentially-inappropriate-therapies-of-questionable-benefit/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The precedent in the Gard case suggests that, instead, courts may make an independent evaluation of which medically endorsed treatment is best.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8199211\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H582800934\"><span class=\"h2\">Futility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medical futility has proven difficult to define. In the Oxford English Dictionary, the word futility is defined as &ldquo;leaky, vain, falling out of the desired end through intrinsic defect.&rdquo; The word is derived from the Latin <em>futtilis</em>, meaning a vessel wide at the top and narrow at the bottom that tipped over and poured out its contents whenever it was filled. These definitions and word origins invoke the images of the Danaides from Greek mythology, eternally filling an unfillable vessel to atone for their sins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-medically-futile-and-potentially-inappropriate-therapies-of-questionable-benefit/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Doctors and nurses caring for extremely ill patients could resonate with the feeling of carrying water in a leaky bucket, continually working towards a goal that could not be achieved.</p><p>Attempts to provide clarity to the definition of futility have led to multiple qualifiers of the term, including physiological futility, quantitative futility, qualitative futility, and potentially inappropriate or inadvisable therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8199217\"><span class=\"h3\">Physiological futility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Physiological futility describes medical interventions that could not possibly result in a physiological goal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-medically-futile-and-potentially-inappropriate-therapies-of-questionable-benefit/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Using a specific antimicrobial, for instance, for a bacterial infection that is resistant to that antimicrobial is physiologically futile. Another example is performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) on a patient with a ruptured myocardium.</p><p>This definition carries the assumption that each medical intervention has a specific physiological goal, and that the clinician is able to determine if achieving that goal is at all possible. An action or treatment cannot be considered futile unless its goal is clearly stated. Critics of the use of the term &ldquo;physiological futility&rdquo; argue two points:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Goals may exist other than the perceived physiological goal. For example, in performing CPR on a terminally-ill patient, perhaps the true goal is not to restore a spontaneous heartbeat, but rather to give the family a measure of certainty that everything has been attempted. In this instance, CPR could be considered &ldquo;physiologically futile,&rdquo; but not necessarily futile if we were to apply other definitions.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The term &ldquo;physiological futility&rdquo; implies that a clinician knows with certainty the likelihood that an intervention cannot reach a physiological goal. However, the clinician&rsquo;s predictive abilities may not be that absolute.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8199223\"><span class=\"h3\">Quantitative futility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term quantitative futility focuses on the numeric probability of achieving the intended goal of therapy, which is generally presumed to be cure and survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-medically-futile-and-potentially-inappropriate-therapies-of-questionable-benefit/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. It is used interchangeably with physiological futility by some, although some argue that quantitative futility, the likelihood or chance that a treatment will benefit a patient, differs from physiologic futility, which measures the outcome achieved, whether likely or not, by the effect on the patient&rsquo;s physiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-medically-futile-and-potentially-inappropriate-therapies-of-questionable-benefit/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Properly understood, physiological futility is quantitative futility with a probability of zero. &#160;</p><p>Those who advocate the use of this term recognize that a possibility of death or survival is not absolute and that some probability threshold should be established. This approach utilizes published data on medical outcomes incorporated with personal clinician experience to determine a probability of survival following a given treatment.</p><p>While this mechanism of applying data attempts to make decisions more straightforward, it requires a judgment call on what level of likelihood should be the threshold for making a decision. Some recommend that clinicians use empiric evidence, including personal experience or published data, to assess the likelihood of a treatment being successful. One proposal is that if the last 100 cases experienced or reported indicate that the treatment did not achieve the desired end, then it could be regarded as futile [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-medically-futile-and-potentially-inappropriate-therapies-of-questionable-benefit/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. However, is &le;1 percent possibility of survival an appropriate threshold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-medically-futile-and-potentially-inappropriate-therapies-of-questionable-benefit/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]? What if another clinician or family member believes that a 0.5 percent chance of survival warrants aggressive therapeutic interventions? Whose threshold should be used for making the decision? Investigators have shown wide variations in the threshold of judging quantitative futility when physicians and laypeople are compared [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-medically-futile-and-potentially-inappropriate-therapies-of-questionable-benefit/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>Another problem is that most published studies that purport to guide determinations of futility are based on insufficient data to provide statistical confidence for clinical decision-making [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-medically-futile-and-potentially-inappropriate-therapies-of-questionable-benefit/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In addition, available published data on survivability may already be skewed by health care perceptions on futility. Published mortality rates for a specific patient demographic may be 100 percent or close to it because attempts at improving this outcome are not made because of the poor prognosis, thus creating a self-fulfilling prophecy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8199229\"><span class=\"h3\">Qualitative futility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Viewing futility from a qualitative viewpoint shifts the focus from achieving a level of certainty to a focus on the quality of the potential benefits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-medically-futile-and-potentially-inappropriate-therapies-of-questionable-benefit/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In other words, there is a distinction made between an effect of treatment that is limited to some part of the patient&rsquo;s body and a benefit that improves the patient as a whole that can be perceived and appreciated by that patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-medically-futile-and-potentially-inappropriate-therapies-of-questionable-benefit/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>If a therapeutic intervention might prolong survival even a small amount, with minimal suffering and an improvement in quality of life, one could refute its futility. On the other hand, if an intervention would cause significant suffering while offering only a brief (or possibility of brief) extension to the length of life, the opposite could be argued. This means of determining futility, however, is subjective and requires individuals to make judgment calls on what constitutes quality, and a decision on what is &ldquo;good enough.&rdquo; This may lead to disagreements between clinicians, patients, and family members, who may view the balance of benefit and harm from certain therapeutic options quite differently.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3472075001\"><span class=\"h3\">Combined and other definitions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some argue that both quantitative and qualitative futility must be considered in any assessment of the overall futility of a treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-medically-futile-and-potentially-inappropriate-therapies-of-questionable-benefit/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. As either variable approaches a likelihood of no possible positive outcomes, the power of continued intervention is diminished.</p><p>Other ways to define futility include &ldquo;lethal condition futility&rdquo; and &ldquo;imminent demise futility&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-medically-futile-and-potentially-inappropriate-therapies-of-questionable-benefit/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In both of these situations, the underlying condition is terminal in the short term (days, weeks, or months) and cannot be reversed or impacted by treatment. While an intervention may have a physiological impact upon the patient, such as CPR restoring a spontaneous heartbeat, they argue that the intervention will not alter the trajectory of the underlying illness and is therefore futile.</p><p>Two states have implemented this concept of futility in their Physician Orders for Life-sustaining Treatment (POLST) laws. Vermont permits a physician to write a do-not-resuscitate (DNR) order without consent when CPR would not prevent &ldquo;imminent death&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-medically-futile-and-potentially-inappropriate-therapies-of-questionable-benefit/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Similarly, Maryland permits a physician to write a DNR order without consent when CPR would be &ldquo;medically ineffective,&rdquo; which means that it would not prevent &ldquo;impending death&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-medically-futile-and-potentially-inappropriate-therapies-of-questionable-benefit/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. &#160; </p><p>Because of the multiple difficulties in creating a clear definition and criteria for futility, some have argued that the term is so value-laden that it is impossible to apply in an objective manner. These critics suggest that the term be abandoned altogether [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-medically-futile-and-potentially-inappropriate-therapies-of-questionable-benefit/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H915520555\"><span class=\"h3\">Futility versus cost-effectiveness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some believe that the issue of futility will inevitably be submerged in the debate about health care reform and utilization of limited resources, and the need for society to determine where resources are appropriately spent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-medically-futile-and-potentially-inappropriate-therapies-of-questionable-benefit/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Societies with nationalized health care have certainly made decisions about how money and resources should be allocated based upon cost-effectiveness.</p><p>However, there is a clear distinction between cost-effectiveness and futility, and between futile and rationed treatments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-medically-futile-and-potentially-inappropriate-therapies-of-questionable-benefit/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Clinicians should not label interventions as futile simply because they believe the treatment is not cost-effective.

The more common and much more difficult circumstance occurs when treatment offers some small prospect of benefit at a great burden of suffering, but the patient or family nevertheless desires it. If the physician and patient (or appropriate surrogate) cannot agree on how to proceed, there is no easy, automatic solution. Consultation with learned colleagues or an ethics consultation may be helpful in ascertaining what interventions have a reasonable balance of burden and benefit. Timely transfer of care to another clinician who is willing to pursue the patient&rsquo;s preference may resolve the problem. Infrequently, resort to the courts may be necessary.

It provides definitions of &ldquo;irreversible conditions,&rdquo; &ldquo;terminal conditions,&rdquo; and &ldquo;life-sustaining treatment.&rdquo; It delineates steps for approaching disagreements, including first having the case reviewed by an ethics or medical committee [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-medically-futile-and-potentially-inappropriate-therapies-of-questionable-benefit/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>]. The results from this meeting are then presented to the patient or patient surrogate, and they can be asked for in written form. If the clinician and the patient or surrogate continue to disagree, the clinician will attempt to transfer the patient to another clinician or facility. Life-sustaining support will be maintained during any pending transfer and up to 10 days following the written decision. If an accepting clinician or facility cannot be found within those 10 days, the clinician and facility are not required to continue support [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-medically-futile-and-potentially-inappropriate-therapies-of-questionable-benefit/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p>The directive also provides legal support to the health care team and guarantees that a patient will be supported for a period of time while alternative treatment facilities are considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-medically-futile-and-potentially-inappropriate-therapies-of-questionable-benefit/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>].

This statute mandates that health care &ldquo;may not be withdrawn or denied if its provision is directed&rdquo; by the patient&rsquo;s surrogate. Oklahoma enacted similar legislation, the Nondiscrimination in Treatment Act, in 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-medically-futile-and-potentially-inappropriate-therapies-of-questionable-benefit/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1051353688\"><span class=\"h2\">DNR consent laws</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>More recently, states have enacted laws prohibiting clinicians from writing do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders without consent. For example, in 2017 several states considered nearly identical versions of a bill called &ldquo;Simon&rsquo;s Law.&rdquo; The law is named after Simon Crosier, a baby with Trisomy 18 for whom physicians instituted a DNR order without either his parents&rsquo; consent or knowledge. Kansas enacted the law, which is directed at prohibiting unilateral DNR orders for minors, in 2017 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-medically-futile-and-potentially-inappropriate-therapies-of-questionable-benefit/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>Simon&rsquo;s Law imposes three mandates on Kansas providers. First, it requires hospitals and medical facilities with policies about withholding life-sustaining treatment to disclose those policies upon request. Second, the law prohibits physicians from instituting a DNR order on a minor patient unless at least one parent has first been informed both orally and in writing. Third, Simon&rsquo;s Law prohibits physicians from instituting a DNR order if either parent refuses consent.</p><p>Similarly, but going beyond the pediatric context, in a special 2017 legislative session, Texas enacted a statute that requires that clinicians must obtain patient or surrogate consent for DNR orders, except in one situation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-medically-futile-and-potentially-inappropriate-therapies-of-questionable-benefit/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. That exception is when in the reasonable medical judgment of the patient&rsquo;s attending physician, both 1) the patient&rsquo;s death is imminent, regardless of the provision of cardiopulmonary resuscitation; and 2) the DNR order is medically appropriate. Still, even in that situation, clinicians may not write a DNR order if that would be &ldquo;contrary to the directions of a patient who was competent at the time the patient conveyed the directions.&rdquo;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8199307\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL SCENARIOS IN PALLIATIVE CARE SETTINGS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8199315\"><span class=\"h2\">Prematurity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The limit of viability is defined as the stage of fetal maturity that ensures a reasonable chance of survival. Determining the limit of viability is desirable so that futile, costly, and painful interventions can be avoided in the infant who does not have a chance of survival.

While it is generally accepted that &lt;22-week estimated gestational age infants are non-viable, there is a &ldquo;grey zone&rdquo; in regards to which neonates born at 22 to 23 weeks gestation should be aggressively resuscitated. Furthermore, there is a significant margin of error (eg, a few days to two weeks) in the estimation of gestational age using either prenatal or postnatal assessment tools.

The treatment of babies with trisomy 13 and 18 is one example. The available data suggest that these patients have an extremely low likelihood of survival past one year of age, and those that survive beyond one year of age have severe intellectual disability, with a poor quality of life and significant utilization of health care resources [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-medically-futile-and-potentially-inappropriate-therapies-of-questionable-benefit/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. The resuscitation of these infants has been generally regarded as futile. Because of the lethality of the diagnosis, clinicians have routinely recommended pregnancy termination (if diagnosed prenatally) or limitation of aggressive interventions after birth, although this noninterventional paradigm is not universal. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-cytogenetic-abnormalities#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital cytogenetic abnormalities&quot;, section on 'Trisomy 18 syndrome'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=congenital-cytogenetic-abnormalities#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Congenital cytogenetic abnormalities&quot;, section on 'Trisomy 13 syndrome'</a>.)</p><p>Published data on survival rates have been used to justify the lethality of the disease, and some have begun to argue that this creates a &ldquo;self-fulfilling prophecy&rdquo; on these children&rsquo;s likelihood of survival. Survival beyond infancy is possible, especially in those who receive intensive treatment. Families that have begun to demand full medical intervention report a different quality of life and length of survival than is reported in medical literature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-medically-futile-and-potentially-inappropriate-therapies-of-questionable-benefit/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>], and they advocate against unilateral decisions that limit the use of aggressive interventions. Others still argue that aggressive treatment for these infants gives too much weight to parental autonomy, and they believe that aggressive treatment may not be in the best interest of the patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-medically-futile-and-potentially-inappropriate-therapies-of-questionable-benefit/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].

Obtundation or coma is frequent early on, followed by recovery or evolution to brain death or persistent vegetative state (PVS). On the basis of available clinical data, PVS is judged to be permanent after three months if induced non-traumatically. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypoxic-ischemic-brain-injury-in-adults-evaluation-and-prognosis#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in adults: Evaluation and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Persistent vegetative state'</a>.)</p><p>PVS results in complete unawareness of oneself and one&rsquo;s environment. These patients are incapable of interacting with others; they have no sustained, reproducible, purposeful, or voluntary behavioral responses to stimuli; and they have no evidence of language comprehension or expression. They have the presence of sleep-wake cycles with the preservation of hypothalamic and brainstem function. Because the patient is unaware of <span class=\"nowrap\">him/herself</span> or their environment, they are not able to suffer or experience pain, despite what may appear as grimaces, crying, or other expressions of discomfort. The perception of pain and suffering is a conscious experience governed by the cerebral cortex, while the expression of pain may be elicited at any level of the nervous system, including the <span class=\"nowrap\">motor/behavioral,</span> endocrinologic, and autonomic responses that may occur as reflexes in the absence of consciousness. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypoxic-ischemic-brain-injury-in-adults-evaluation-and-prognosis#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypoxic-ischemic brain injury in adults: Evaluation and prognosis&quot;, section on 'Family counseling'</a>.)</p><p>While aggressive treatments for individuals with PVS would not qualify as physiologically futile, as treatment might be able to maintain cardiopulmonary function, they may be considered qualitatively futile because of the lack of benefit in terms of quality of life. Common ethical challenges in these patients revolve around the pursuit of surgically placed feeding tubes and tracheotomies with chronic ventilator support. While the patient may not be considered to either suffer or benefit from any of these aggressive treatments because they are in a PVS, there is clearly an impact on the family, health care team, and society.

In the absence of known wishes or directives, decision-makers should focus on whether ongoing treatments are consistent with the patient&rsquo;s known values and goals. In the absence of either stated preferences or known wishes, families must make treatment decisions that are in the patient&rsquo;s best interest. But these decisions can be very difficult. Some families, given time and information, can agree that pursuit of these treatments is not beneficial. However, some families and patients possess religious or cultural beliefs that support continuation of life even if the patient is unaware [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-medically-futile-and-potentially-inappropriate-therapies-of-questionable-benefit/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8199333\"><span class=\"h2\">Brain death (death using neurologic criteria)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Brain death (death by neurologic criteria) is defined as the irreversible cessation of cerebral and brainstem function. There is no respiratory drive, and thus there are no spontaneous breaths regardless of hypercarbia or hypoxemia. There are no responses arising from the brain (including cranial nerve reflexes and motor responses) to stimuli, although spinal reflexes may persist. One is legally dead in the United States when neurologic criteria for death have been demonstrated. However, vital organ function may be maintained in these patients, sometimes for long periods, through artificial ventilatory support. Requirements for the declaration of brain death are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-brain-death\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of brain death&quot;</a>.) </p><p>The diagnosis of death using neurologic criteria is an area where, until recently, the meaning of futility was very clear. The concept first came into the literature in the 1950s, and in 1968 the Harvard criteria for brain death were published, putting forth an agreed-upon definition of the term and recommendations for its use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-medically-futile-and-potentially-inappropriate-therapies-of-questionable-benefit/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. The committee stated: &ldquo;Death is to be declared and <em>then</em> the respirator turned off. The decision to do this and the responsibility for it are to be taken by the physician-in-charge, in consultation with one or more physicians who have been directly involved in the case. It is unsound and undesirable to force the family to make the decision.&rdquo; Therefore, since the conception of this definition of death, it was deemed appropriate for clinicians to stop medical intervention following the declaration of death by neurologic criteria. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-brain-death\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of brain death&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Since then, declaring death by neurologic criteria has legally been accepted as a means of declaring death (the other being cardiopulmonary death), although New Jersey allows for religious exemptions (ie, nonacceptance of neurologic criteria as a final verdict for death). Three other states require brief reasonable accommodation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-medically-futile-and-potentially-inappropriate-therapies-of-questionable-benefit/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. While cases have been brought to court challenging a clinician&rsquo;s ability to declare a patient dead by these criteria and to stop futile medical intervention, courts have generally honored the legal acceptance of brain death.</p><p>However, these issues once again came to the forefront with the case of Jahi McMath, a 13-year-old girl who suffered a cardiopulmonary arrest in the wake of surgery for sleep apnea, with anoxic brain injury progressing to death as defined by neurologic criteria. Following this declaration of death, the family requested and was granted a restraining order preventing the hospital from disconnecting Jahi from the ventilator, on religious grounds. Although the diagnosis of death by neurologic criteria was confirmed by consulting clinicians, the court order was extended, providing the McMath family time to find an accepting health care facility in New Jersey. She has subsequently received a surgically placed feeding tube and is maintained through a tracheostomy on a ventilator. Those who support the family state that only patients and their surrogates should have the right to decide when medical treatment stops, not medical personnel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-medically-futile-and-potentially-inappropriate-therapies-of-questionable-benefit/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8199339\"><span class=\"h2\">Slow or short codes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the 1970s and 1980s, the practice of unilateral, undisclosed do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders and &ldquo;slow codes&rdquo; was discovered. Clinicians were independently deciding either not to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) or to deliberately provide inadequate or half-hearted CPR (a &ldquo;slow code&rdquo;), knowing that it would not be effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-medically-futile-and-potentially-inappropriate-therapies-of-questionable-benefit/abstract/1,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,63</a>].

The American College of Physicians Ethics Manual states, &ldquo;Because it is deceptive, physicians or nurses should not perform half-hearted resuscitation efforts&rdquo; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-medically-futile-and-potentially-inappropriate-therapies-of-questionable-benefit/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. </p><p>Some distinguish three related concepts: &ldquo;slow codes,&rdquo; which refer to how timely CPR is administered, &ldquo;show codes&rdquo; or &ldquo;Hollywood codes,&rdquo; which refer to inadequate or half-hearted CPR, and &ldquo;short codes,&rdquo; which refer to the duration of CPR. While slow codes and show codes are condemned, the potential role of a &ldquo;short code&rdquo; continues to be debated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-medically-futile-and-potentially-inappropriate-therapies-of-questionable-benefit/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. When a family member refuses to consent to a DNR order in the instance of a patient with certain imminent mortality, the clinician is faced with either placing a unilateral DNR order or performing futile CPR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-medically-futile-and-potentially-inappropriate-therapies-of-questionable-benefit/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. If it is known that the CPR will be futile, it may be argued that adjusting the length or extent of the CPR might meet the family&rsquo;s need (seeing that everything has been done) while limiting the suffering of or battery to the patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-medically-futile-and-potentially-inappropriate-therapies-of-questionable-benefit/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].

And they are followed by treating health care professionals once the patient has been transported to a health care facility. In short, seriously ill patients can materially reduce the chance of unwanted treatments by completing a POLST [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-medically-futile-and-potentially-inappropriate-therapies-of-questionable-benefit/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].

Do-not-escalate-treatment (DNET) orders may prolong the dying process as compared with immediate withdrawal of support, providing the family more time with their loved one.

The intervention included providing the patients&rsquo; clinicians with frequent prognostic data, obtaining and updating the chart with patient and family care preferences, and providing skilled nursing to organize and help conduct family meetings. The phase I observational study revealed significant shortcomings in communication, knowledge of patients&rsquo; wishes regarding cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and an overall high frequency of aggressive treatments. The hope was that the improved availability of prognostic information and communication with patients and families would improve these shortcomings. However, the investigators found that the intervention failed to improve care or patient outcomes, and it did not reduce use of hospital resources.</p><p>Fins and Solomon, in their studies of communication to resolve futility disputes, found that, in addition to good communication, other needed elements were: a) clinicians&rsquo; self-awareness, b) early recognition of impending disputes, c) psychological insight into the cause of the dispute, and d) an institutional culture that promotes good communication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-medically-futile-and-potentially-inappropriate-therapies-of-questionable-benefit/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>].

This may be beneficial in scenarios where treatment may be considered futile or <span class=\"nowrap\">inappropriate/inadvisable</span> therapies and disagreement exists between parties. The goal of the trial should be determined and agreed upon between the health care team and the patient or surrogate. A specific timeframe should be determined, although the specific duration may depend, in part, on the underlying illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-medically-futile-and-potentially-inappropriate-therapies-of-questionable-benefit/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. It is advised that a written contract be used. During the trial, all parties will have the opportunity to get a better sense of prognosis and efficacy of treatment and to adjust to illness realities.

Uncertainty about the appropriateness or benefit of interventions is a product of different perspectives on what constitutes benefit to patients and how individuals <span class=\"nowrap\">(patients/families</span> as well as clinicians) can vary dramatically in how they define value as related to life. (See <a href=\"#H8199179\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">While the legal and moral acceptability of treatment limitation is well established, clarity in establishing goals of care, timing of the transition from cure to palliation, and communication of specific decisions to withhold further aggressive interventions remain problematic for both patients and clinicians. (See <a href=\"#H8199187\" class=\"local\">'Autonomy and medical futility'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In 2015, five critical care societies, the American Thoracic Society (ATS), the Association of Critical-Care Nurses (AACN), the American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP), the European Society of Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM), and the Society of Critical Care Medicine (SCCM) officially endorsed new and specific terminology that should be used when discussing and categorizing treatments of questionable benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/palliative-care-medically-futile-and-potentially-inappropriate-therapies-of-questionable-benefit/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>] (see <a href=\"#H8199211\" class=\"local\">'Definitions'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The five-society statement maintains that the term &ldquo;futile&rdquo; should be used only in the rare circumstance that an intervention definitely cannot accomplish the intended physiological goal. The statement provides the example of performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation on a patient with a ruptured myocardium. (See <a href=\"#H8199217\" class=\"local\">'Physiological futility'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The term &ldquo;inappropriate&rdquo; should be used, rather than &ldquo;futile,&rdquo; to describe the more common situation in which treatments have at least some chance of accomplishing the effect sought by the patient, but clinicians believe that competing ethical considerations justify not providing them. In contrast to &ldquo;futile&rdquo; treatment, disagreements over a &ldquo;potentially inappropriate&rdquo; treatment are value based. (See <a href=\"#H10069373\" class=\"local\">'Futile versus potentially inappropriate treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>&ldquo;Legally proscribed&rdquo; treatments are those that are prohibited by applicable laws, judicial precedent, or widely accepted public policies. The statement offers the example of circumventing organ allocation policies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>&ldquo;Legally discretionary&rdquo; treatments are those for which there are specific laws, judicial precedent, or policies that give physicians permission to refuse to administer them.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We agree with these definitions. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One of the major barriers to the definition and acceptance of the concept of medical futility and potentially inappropriate treatment is the uncertainty that often exists when prognosis is delivered to patients and their families. A high degree of certainty is required for the application of futility. (See <a href=\"#H8199247\" class=\"local\">'The complexity of prognostication'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having an advance directive (AD) clearly decreases the use of life-sustaining treatment and increases the use of hospice or palliative care. However, concerns from clinicians that an AD may not always reflect the patient&rsquo;s wishes in the exact clinical scenario may limit their utility. (See <a href=\"#H8199351\" class=\"local\">'Advance directives'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Seriously ill patients can materially reduce the chance of unwanted treatments by completing a Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining treatments (POLST) form. POLST forms are immediately actionable and transportable. (See <a href=\"#H21523703\" class=\"local\">'Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment (POLST)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most disagreements about futile or potentially inappropriate treatments can be resolved with time and continued efforts to come to consensus. Some surrogate decision-makers remain uncomfortable with being asked to withdraw or withhold treatments but may understand that certain limits of therapeutic intervention have been reached. Reframing the conversation to identifying where limits should be set (ie, do-not-escalate-treatment [DNET] orders), rather than asking for agreement to stop treatments altogether, may help to resolve conflicts. (See <a href=\"#H10069466\" class=\"local\">'Do-not-escalate-treatment orders'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In some cases, it may also be appropriate for clinicians to make a recommendation about limiting treatment without specifically asking surrogates to explicitly verbalize agreement. The surrogates&rsquo; &ldquo;non-dissent&rdquo; may be a way of accepting limits of therapeutic intervention without necessarily explicitly endorsing those limits. (See <a href=\"#H2321457453\" class=\"local\">'The nudge/assent model'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We specifically recommend against unilateral, undisclosed do-not-resuscitate (DNR) orders and the use of &ldquo;slow codes&rdquo; (ie, deliberately inadequate or half-hearted cardiopulmonary resuscitation [CPR]). (See <a href=\"#H8199339\" class=\"local\">'Slow or short codes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Policy statements on dealing with futile and potentially inappropriate therapies are available from several groups. (See <a href=\"#H8199259\" class=\"local\">'Major policy statements'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In addition, a number of states have passed laws mandating consent for withdrawal of treatment and DNR orders. (See <a href=\"#H3265629224\" class=\"local\">'Notable state laws'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An algorithmic approach to managing disputed treatment requests in the intensive care unit, as recommended by five joint critical care societies, is provided in the algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F113810\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef113810 \">algorithm 2</a>); this approach may also apply to other health care settings. (See <a href=\"#H3185925943\" class=\"local\">'ATS/AACN/ACCP/ESICM/SCCM (2015)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A framework approach for clinicians to use in resolving conflict regarding potentially inappropriate treatments, also as suggested by the five joint critical care societies, is provided in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PALC%2F113819\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef113819 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H8199369\" class=\"local\">'Framework for clinicians to use in resolving conflict'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A time-limited therapeutic trial may be beneficial in scenarios where treatment may be considered futile or <span class=\"nowrap\">inappropriate/inadvisable</span> and disagreement exists between parties. The goal of the trial should be determined and agreed upon between the health care team and the patient or surrogate prior to the trial. (See <a href=\"#H8199375\" class=\"local\">'Time-limited trials'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For non-palliative-care-trained clinicians struggling with communication and consensus with patients and families around end of life issues, obtaining a palliative care consult can provide benefit. (See <a href=\"#H8199381\" class=\"local\">'Palliative care consultations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If conflicts over the aggressiveness of care cannot be resolved, then the courts can be a last resort.
