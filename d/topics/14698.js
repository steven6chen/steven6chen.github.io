It is the second most common RBC enzyme defect but is the commonest cause of hemolytic anemia from an RBC enzyme deficiency.</p><p>This topic reviews the pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of PK deficiency. General approaches to evaluating the cause of hemolytic anemia are presented separately:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Children</strong> &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hemolytic-anemias-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hemolytic anemias in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Adults</strong> &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-hemolytic-anemia-in-the-adult\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of hemolytic anemia in the adult&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3391742163\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PK deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder; affected individuals are either homozygous for a single pathogenic mutation or compound heterozygous for two different pathogenic mutations affecting the function of the PK enzyme in red blood cells (RBCs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyruvate-kinase-deficiency/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Individuals who are heterozygous for PK deficiency have intermediate enzyme levels and are not affected clinically.</p><p>PK enzymes consist of several isoforms. They are products of two distinct genes, both encoding enzymes that catalyze the transphosphorylation of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) into pyruvate and ATP. Clinical PK deficiency with hemolytic anemia is limited to mutations of the <em>PKLR</em> gene:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong><em>PKLR</em></strong> &ndash; The <em>PKLR</em> gene encodes the L (liver) and R (RBC) isoenzymes. The R isoform, unique to RBCs, is 33 amino acids larger than the L isoform, which is unique to hepatocytes. Expression in RBCs versus liver is due to differential use of tissue-specific promoters, which drive expression as well as exon usage. The <em>PKLR</em> gene is located on chromosome 1q21.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong><em>PKM</em></strong> &ndash; The <em>PKM</em> gene encodes the M (muscle) enzyme. This form is expressed in muscle, brain, white blood cells (WBCs), and platelets. There are two isoforms, M1 and M2, which result from differential processing of a single transcript. The M2 isoform is dominant during fetal development. After birth, the M2 isoform persists in WBCs and platelets. In RBC progenitor cells, the M2 isoform is progressively replaced with the R form during fetal development. The <em>PKM</em> gene is located on chromosome 15q22.</p><p/><p>Well over 100 pathogenic variants and eight polymorphic sites have been reported on the <em>PKLR</em> gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyruvate-kinase-deficiency/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. The variants include single nucleotide substitutions as well as intronic and exonic deletions and insertions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyruvate-kinase-deficiency/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Known variants are listed in a publicly available <a href=\"https://grenada.lumc.nl/LOVD2/mendelian_genes/home.php?select_db=PKLR&amp;token=4YQ9Z5FUp70OHSrvIBc62i6d/wOHHZJM2uIBPyJ0yLJ4qaPHdypQ3cA8RtguYoAJRNnWc1LCQNeQLREa3k4fcZ36W8VekwbLsNsmc4nZ1xk=&amp;TOPIC_ID=7129\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">database</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyruvate-kinase-deficiency/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. The C1151T mutation, which results in substitution of threonine for methionine at amino acid 384, is especially common, even among unrelated families of different ethnicities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyruvate-kinase-deficiency/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>The frequency of pathogenic <em>PKLR</em> gene mutations is far lower than that of the mutations affecting glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), which cause G6PD deficiency. However, unlike G6PD deficiency, which may only manifest hemolysis under certain circumstances such as exposure to oxidant drugs, in PK deficiency, the hemolysis is chronic. Thus, PK deficiency is the most common RBC enzyme defect causing chronic congenital non-spherocytic hemolytic anemia.</p><p>Mutations of genes other than <em>PKLR</em> have been shown to reduce PK enzymatic activity, although these are rare. As an example, compound heterozygous mutations in the gene that encodes Kruppel-like factor 1 (KLF1), the hematopoietic-specific transcription factor essential for induction of expression of adult beta globin and other erythroid genes, have been associated with severe transfusion-dependent hemolytic anemia and PK enzyme deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyruvate-kinase-deficiency/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fetal-hemoglobin-hemoglobin-f-in-health-and-disease#H6141716\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fetal hemoglobin (hemoglobin F) in health and disease&quot;, section on 'Kruppel-like factor 1 (KLF1)'</a>.)</p><p>Genes that <strong>increase</strong> PK activity have also been postulated, although no specific genes causing PK hyperactivity have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyruvate-kinase-deficiency/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2590114074\"><span class=\"h2\">PK enzymatic function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RBCs use several enzyme systems to maintain their viability and function. Two of the major processes under enzymatic control are the production of energy, in the form of ATP, and protection from oxidative injury, by compounds that act as reducing agents. The PK enzyme functions in the energy-producing glycolytic pathway, which metabolizes glucose to generate ATP for the cell.</p><p>As shown in the figure, PK catalyzes the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate by removal of a phosphate group (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F83968\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83968 \">figure 1</a>). The phosphate group from PEP is transferred to ADP to create one molecule of ATP.</p><p>The PK enzyme is a homotetramer that contains four molecules of the PK protein. Thus, in an individual who is heterozygous for two different <em>PKLR</em> mutations, five different tetramer compositions will be present (eg, tetramers containing 0, 25, 50, 75, and 100 percent of each of the two abnormal protein subunits).</p><p>PK is an allosteric enzyme (an enzyme for which binding of an effector to one region of the enzyme results in altered conformation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> altered enzymatic activity towards a substrate that binds to another region of the enzyme). The substrate for PK is PEP and the allosteric regulator is fructose 1,6-diphosphate (FDP); binding to FDP changes the conformational structure of PK and its enzymatic activity towards PEP.</p><p>As noted above, there are two different genes that encode different PK isoforms (see <a href=\"#H3391742163\" class=\"local\">'Genetics'</a> above). Individuals with PK deficiency have mutations in the <em>PKLR</em> gene that cause reduced PK activity in RBCs. However, the PK activity in other cell types such as WBCs, platelets, and other tissues is normal because the enzyme expressed in these cells is encoded on a separate gene.</p><p>Pathogenic mutations in the <em>PKLR</em> gene may affect any of the following properties of the PK enzyme [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyruvate-kinase-deficiency/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Altered affinity for PEP (its substrate)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Altered affinity for FDP (its allosteric activator)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Altered enzymatic stability</p><p/><p>Genotype-phenotype correlations have been examined for several of the common mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyruvate-kinase-deficiency/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The most severe clinical phenotypes are generally associated with mutations that cause premature stop codons, frameshifts, or large deletions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanism of hemolysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mechanism for hemolysis in PK deficiency is not clear. Although the defect in ATP generation contributes to hemolysis, it is not a sufficient explanation; this conclusion is based on observations that ATP deficiency is difficult to demonstrate in some of the affected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyruvate-kinase-deficiency/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In addition, other disorders with more severe degrees of ATP deficiency are not associated with significant hemolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyruvate-kinase-deficiency/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>Hemolysis in PK deficiency is mainly extravascular (ie, due to phagocytosis of cells by reticuloendothelial macrophages); however, if the hemolysis is severe, there may be spillover to intravascular hemolysis.</p><p>It has been proposed that the mechanism of hemolysis in PK deficiency is similar to the as yet unexplained destruction of young RBCs described in individuals descending from high altitude, a process termed &quot;neocytolysis.&quot; It is possible that the process may involve impaired mitochondrial autophagy, resulting in increased mitochondrial mass, in turn leading to increased production of reactive oxygen species (ROS); however, this remains speculative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyruvate-kinase-deficiency/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>].</p><p>Patients with hemolytic anemia who undergo splenectomy, with a resultant decrease in the hemolytic process and improvement of anemia, have a higher number of reticulocytes than they did before the splenectomy. This perplexing observation indicates that knowledge of the regulation of erythropoiesis and reticulocyte kinetics remains incomplete. A significant interaction may occur between the spleen and PK-deficient, young RBCs, through an as yet unknown mechanism that influences premature splenic destruction of reticulocytes and young RBCs, especially in patients with more severe PK deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyruvate-kinase-deficiency/abstract/19-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-23</a>].</p><p>The metabolic disturbances in PK deficiency affect the survival of RBCs as well as the maturation of erythroid progenitor cells in the spleen, which results in their apoptosis (referred to as ineffective erythropoiesis). Ineffective erythropoiesis in the spleen has been demonstrated in a four-year-old PK-deficient patient who underwent splenectomy, as well as in a mouse model of PK deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyruvate-kinase-deficiency/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. However, it remains to be established whether apoptosis of erythroid progenitor cells in the bone marrow plays a role in the anemia of PK deficiency, as well as whether PK activity has a more general role in apoptotic pathways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyruvate-kinase-deficiency/abstract/13,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,25</a>].</p><p>The severity of hemolysis is hypothesized to be determined by the degree of enzyme disruption conferred by the specific combination of <em>PKLR</em> gene mutations, as well as a possible compensatory increase in the expression of the M2 PK isoform, which is expressed from the unaffected <em>PKM</em> gene, although this has not been definitively demonstrated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyruvate-kinase-deficiency/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8012941\"><span class=\"h2\">Increased oxygen delivery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PK-deficient RBCs show enhanced oxygen delivery for a given partial pressure of oxygen in the bloodstream. This is because the block in glycolysis in PK deficiency is downstream of the Rappaport-Luebering shunt, which results in formation of the metabolic intermediate 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG; previously called 2,3-diphosphoglycerate [2,3-DPG]). An accumulation of 2,3-BPG has been noted in PK deficiency, in contrast to a low concentration in hexokinase deficiency, which is upstream from the shunt. This increased 2,3-BPG leads to a &quot;rightward&quot; shift of the oxygen dissociation curve for hemoglobin in patients with PK deficiency (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F83968\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83968 \">figure 1</a>), resulting in better oxygen delivery to the tissues. As a result, individuals with PK deficiency may tolerate anemia better than those with defects upstream to the Rappaport-Luebering shunt that do not cause a rightward shift in the hemoglobin oxygen curve, such as hexokinase deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyruvate-kinase-deficiency/abstract/13,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,19</a>].

This pathway is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=regulation-of-iron-balance\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Regulation of iron balance&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2985888609\"><span class=\"h2\">Possible protection from malaria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is not clear whether PK deficiency protects against any form of malaria.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Evidence supporting a protective role</strong> &ndash; In vitro, RBCs from individuals with PK deficiency show reduced invasion by <em>Plasmodium falciparum</em>, and RBCs from individuals with PK deficiency as well as heterozygous carriers show a preferential macrophage clearance of ring-stage-infected RBCs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyruvate-kinase-deficiency/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In a mouse model, PK deficiency confers protection against malaria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyruvate-kinase-deficiency/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Evidence against a protective role</strong> &ndash; The geographic distribution of PK deficiency does not show any indication of a positive selection pressure from malaria as there is for other inherited RBC gene variants such as the sickle mutation, thalassemia mutations, the Duffy blood group system, and certain forms of hereditary elliptocytosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=protection-against-malaria-in-the-hemoglobinopathies\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Protection against malaria in the hemoglobinopathies&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=protection-against-malaria-by-abnormalities-in-red-cell-surface-antigens-and-cytoskeletal-proteins\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Protection against malaria by abnormalities in red cell surface antigens and cytoskeletal proteins&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3152087279\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PK deficiency is extremely rare, but its true prevalence is unknown. Based on the gene frequency of the <em>PKLR</em> 1529A mutation in whites and its relative abundance in patients with hemolytic anemia, a prevalence of approximately 51 cases per million has been estimated in European populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyruvate-kinase-deficiency/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. However, in the experience of this author, the true prevalence of PK-deficient patients encountered by hematologists to whom rare RBC disorders are referred is much lower. There are over 200 individuals with PK deficiency enrolled in an ongoing natural history study (<a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02053480&amp;token=nbsXe3i4qfUea5RCPRHtOS7yhoEzH+MCpwZ1/1ekxPOVepr49aDMPIOGytYRMYkWYM2UZnv8zv9zHqi7F56lfQ==&amp;TOPIC_ID=7129\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">NCT02053480</a>).</p><p>PK deficiency has a worldwide distribution, but it is more common among people of northern European and perhaps Chinese ancestry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyruvate-kinase-deficiency/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p>As with any autosomal recessive disorder, PK deficiency can be more common in groups with a history of inbreeding or consanguinity. As an example, a high frequency of PK deficiency has been documented in Pennsylvanian Amish communities and in a fundamentalist branch of the Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter-day saints (FLDS Church) at the <span class=\"nowrap\">Utah/Arizona</span> border [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyruvate-kinase-deficiency/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. In such isolated populations, a &quot;founder&quot; effect can be implicated readily. In these populations, the frequency of heterozygosity may exceed 1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyruvate-kinase-deficiency/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>PK deficiency has also been described in an inbred mouse strain and in the Basenji dog [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyruvate-kinase-deficiency/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3471078367\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPICAL PRESENTATION AND CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2425296682\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview of presenting findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>PK deficiency is a lifelong condition, but the age of presentation is not predictable and may vary widely due to significant heterogeneity in the severity of hemolysis and anemia, even among individuals who share the same genotype. However, in most cases, members of a family with the same genetic defect tend to have a similar degree of disease severity. The disease has been reported to be particularly severe among the Amish of Pennsylvania, with occasional lethal outcomes in children unless splenectomy is performed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyruvate-kinase-deficiency/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3391742163\" class=\"local\">'Genetics'</a> above.)</p><p>The rarity of the condition and variability of presentation make diagnostic delays common, and affected individuals may carry a diagnosis of unexplained anemia or may be misdiagnosed as having other causes of anemia. In a series of 61 patients with PK deficiency referred to a single center, the median age of diagnosis was 16 years (range, 1 day to 65 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyruvate-kinase-deficiency/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The frequency of findings in this cohort was as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anemia &ndash; 90 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Splenomegaly &ndash; 81 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Jaundice &ndash; 70 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neonatal jaundice &ndash; 59 percent</p><p/><p>The severity of presenting findings is highly variable, from death in utero or shortly after birth due to hydrops fetalis, to transfusion-dependent anemia, to a mild, compensated hemolysis that does not require transfusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyruvate-kinase-deficiency/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The three major types of presentations are <span class=\"nowrap\">kernicterus/neonatal</span> jaundice soon after birth; anemia (during childhood or adulthood), which may be discovered incidentally, based on a positive family history, or due to typical anemia symptoms; or complications such as iron overload caused by ineffective erythropoiesis and increased iron absorption, pigment gallstones, or transient anemia due to a bone marrow insult (eg, in the setting of parvovirus infection). These presentations are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H211241972\" class=\"local\">'Chronic hemolytic anemia from birth'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2083407837\" class=\"local\">'Complications of chronic hemolysis'</a> below.)</p><p>The findings on the complete blood count (CBC) include normocytic anemia, an increased reticulocyte count, and an absence of specific red blood cell (RBC) morphologic abnormalities on the peripheral blood smear. Other laboratory testing is consistent with a Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia. (See <a href=\"#H2936550265\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory findings'</a> below.)</p><p>Unlike glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency, PK deficiency is not associated with increased susceptibility to hemolysis after exposure to oxidant agents.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H211241972\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic hemolytic anemia from birth</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An illustrative case involves a 19-year-old woman who presented with anemia (hemoglobin 7.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL),</span> profound reticulocytosis (46 percent), and progressive liver failure. She had kernicterus as a neonate and was found to have hemolytic anemia without any specific morphologic RBC abnormalities on the peripheral blood smear. She required weekly blood transfusions. A diagnosis of PK deficiency was made based on the typical presentation, absence of positive findings on testing for other inherited hemolytic anemias, and positive testing for PK deficiency on enzymatic testing performed by a reference laboratory. (See <a href=\"#H3513861703\" class=\"local\">'Biochemical testing'</a> below.)</p><p>Management included splenectomy at the age of five months. No transfusions were administered after splenectomy; however, she was moderately anemic (hemoglobin 7.5 to 9 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span> and had laboratory evidence of iron overload (ferritin &gt;3000 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL,</span> transferrin saturation [TSAT] close to 100 percent). She was treated with iron chelation and judicious phlebotomies (starting with volumes of approximately 50 mL and progressively increasing volumes up to 250 mL), and after two years of therapy, her liver function improved and normalized. During this time, her hemoglobin ranged from 8.2 to 9.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> and her iron markers improved (ferritin decreased to 420 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL;</span> transferrin saturation [TSAT] decreased to 62 percent). This case illustrates the combination of clinical features that can develop, their contribution to overall health, and the importance of treating iron overload.

This is done by measuring the reticulocyte count and serum markers of hemolysis such as the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), indirect bilirubin, or haptoglobin. Hemolytic anemia is characterized by an increased reticulocyte count, increased LDH, increased indirect bilirubin, and decreased haptoglobin. Not all affected individuals have anemia, however, as some may have compensated hemolysis without anemia. In some cases, these individuals come to medical attention when they develop an aplastic crisis (eg, in the setting of parvovirus infection) or when they present with complications of hemolysis such as pigment gallstones.</p><p>The next step is to determine whether the hemolysis is chronic and present since birth versus acquired, following a period of normal findings (absence of anemia and hemolysis). If hemolysis has been present throughout life, or if this information is inferred (eg, due to family history) or not verifiable, the peripheral blood smear is examined, with a focus on red blood cell (RBC) morphology (eg, schistocytes, elliptocytes, echinocytes, spherocytes, acanthocytes, sickle cells, RBC inclusions). This may allow elimination of other possible causes of inherited hemolytic anemia with highly characteristic findings on the blood smear (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F72394\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72394 \">table 2</a>), such as hemoglobinopathies (eg, sickle cell disease, thalassemia) and membrane disorders (eg, hereditary spherocytosis, hereditary elliptocytosis). PK deficiency should be considered after these obvious alternative diagnoses have been eliminated. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>In many cases, the presence of chronic lifelong anemia and characteristic RBC morphologies are strongly suggestive of specific inherited disorders of the RBC membrane, hemoglobinopathies, or enzyme deficiencies, and specific diagnostic testing can be obtained. The pace of the evaluation and whether testing is ordered sequentially or simultaneously depends on the severity of the anemia, patient symptoms, and other considerations such as the ease of additional blood draws and follow-up testing.</p><p>If PK deficiency is suspected based on the family history <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> initial evaluation, subsequent testing can be done using a biochemical assay <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> genetic testing, as discussed below.

However, genetic testing may be appropriate in selected cases (eg, family member of a known affected individual for whom the pathogenic PKLR variant[s] have been identified). Another exception may be a patient who has had a recent transfusion; the PK in the transfused RBCs will have normal activity and can make the patient's results appear normal. In the author's experience, two infants with PK deficiency who were receiving monthly blood transfusions had PK enzyme activity only slightly below the normal range; however, after splenectomy and no transfusions for five months, PK activity was markedly deficient.</p><p>Thus, biochemical testing should optimally be deferred for two to three months following the last transfusion; unfortunately, this may not always be possible in severely anemic, transfusion-requiring individuals. In a patient who requires chronic transfusions, DNA testing (ie, <em>PKLR</em> gene sequencing) may be preferable.

FDP is removed by filtration of blood using a cellulose column and dialyzing the hemolysate; the enzyme activity is measured in filtered, dialyzed hemolysate tested at different concentrations of the substrate phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP), with and without FDP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyruvate-kinase-deficiency/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. As noted above, transfused RBCs cannot be removed, and biochemical testing may be affected (eg, falsely normalized) by recent transfusion. In a series of 61 patients with PK deficiency, the median PK activity was 35 percent of normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyruvate-kinase-deficiency/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>However, the gold standard assay in which WBCs, platelets, and FDP are removed is not available at commercial laboratories, and most of the research laboratories capable of this analysis have closed. The author is aware of the laboratory of Richard van Wijk at University Medical Center Utrecht, Netherlands that performs this analysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyruvate-kinase-deficiency/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. The mutant PK enzyme may also be analyzed via kinetic and electrophoretic studies of the partially purified enzyme, although these are also not widely available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyruvate-kinase-deficiency/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>An alternative to the gold standard biochemical assay is to use a rapid screening assay that is widely available in many commercial laboratories. In this assay, the activity of PK is measured in an RBC hemolysate, without the initial steps for removing platelets, WBCs, and FDP. This rapid assay identifies most but not all PK-deficient patients, and, if positive for PK deficiency, it is sufficient to confirm the diagnosis (see <a href=\"#H24330432\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic confirmation'</a> below). However, a negative assay cannot be used to eliminate the possibility of PK deficiency, because the contribution of WBC and platelet PK may make the RBC PK activity appear normal when in fact it is not. A similar issue arises in a patient who has recently received an RBC transfusion because PK activity in the transfused RBCs may cause the assay to appear negative.</p><p>In addition to performing a potentially less sensitive assay, routine commercial laboratories typically cannot perform the appropriate quantitative analyses with varying concentrations of the PEP substrate, which is helpful for screening for high Km (low affinity) mutants or to remove FDP, to detect mutations with altered FDP interaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyruvate-kinase-deficiency/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>Thus, if a screening assay is negative and the suspicion for PK deficiency is high (eg, due to Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia, negative testing for other common intrinsic RBC disorders, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a family history of PK deficiency), additional testing is required. Options are to use testing from a specialized laboratory such as the one in Utrecht or to perform genetic testing. (See <a href=\"#H37330985\" class=\"local\">'Genetic testing'</a> below.)</p><p>Of note, other biochemical testing such as measuring the level of the glycolytic intermediate 2,3-bisphosphoglycerate (2,3-BPG) is not used.

It is important that the RBC PK gene (<em>PKLR</em>) and not the <em>PKM</em> gene is analyzed.

Additional testing may be indicated depending on the details of the presentation. Iron studies are monitored periodically with ferritin levels and additional testing as appropriate.

The level of hemoglobin should not be the sole criterion, and the need for transfusions should be individualized. As noted above, RBCs in individuals with PK deficiency have a right-shifted hemoglobin oxygen dissociation curve, which means that they may be less symptomatic than other individuals with a similar degree of anemia; this is the reason that the hemoglobin level alone should not be used to guide transfusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyruvate-kinase-deficiency/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. In a series of patients with PK deficiency referred to a single center, 38 of 59 (64 percent) received blood transfusions (median number, 15; range, 1 to &gt;100), and 19 (32 percent) were transfusion-dependent during childhood or until they underwent splenectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyruvate-kinase-deficiency/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>For those receiving chronic transfusions, chelation therapy should be instituted early, before iron overload develops.

For individuals who place a high value on avoiding folate deficiency, which could cause worsening anemia, taking daily <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> (typical dose, 1 to 2 mg daily) is safe and inexpensive, and there are essentially no side effects or contraindications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Splenectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Splenectomy improves hemolytic anemia, but there are several risks, including surgical complications, the possibility of sepsis due to encapsulated organisms, and the increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Thus, splenectomy is typically reserved for individuals with severe transfusion-dependent anemia, and the decision of whether to pursue splenectomy must be made on a case-by-case basis. We generally raise the possibility of splenectomy in all individuals who are dependent on chronic transfusions; we also evaluate the possibility of splenectomy in individuals who do not require chronic transfusions but who have a significant decrease in daily activities due to anemia.</p><p>In a series of patients with PK deficiency, 18 of 61 (30 percent) underwent splenectomy (11 before diagnosis and seven after diagnosis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyruvate-kinase-deficiency/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The median hemoglobin level was 7.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> in those who underwent splenectomy; this increased by approximately 1.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> (range, 0.4 to 3.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span> increase) after the procedure. In comparison, those who were not treated with splenectomy had a median hemoglobin level of 9.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span>.</p><p>For additional decision support, it is reasonable to assume that an individual is likely to have a similar benefit as other affected family members and to follow guidelines for splenectomy used in more common congenital hemolytic anemias such as hereditary spherocytosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-spherocytosis#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary spherocytosis&quot;, section on 'Splenectomy'</a>.)</p><p>For individuals who require cholecystectomy for pigment gallstone disease, the option of concomitant splenectomy should be discussed, and if the patient is considering splenectomy, the option of combining the procedures should be strongly encouraged because these procedures can at times be performed simultaneously using laparoscopic techniques. Likewise, any splenectomy candidate should be evaluated for gallstones to consider cholecystectomy at the same time.</p><p>For those who elect to pursue splenectomy, especially children, we try to delay the procedure as long as possible (eg, until after the age of three years or after age six years if possible). Young children who undergo splenectomy should be treated with penicillin until they reach the age of three years. Evidence to guide the optimal age of splenectomy comes mainly from observational data in other conditions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hereditary-spherocytosis#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hereditary spherocytosis&quot;, section on 'Splenectomy'</a>.)</p><p>We also make sure to provide pre-splenectomy vaccinations against encapsulated organisms, similar to individuals undergoing splenectomy for other hematologic conditions such as immune thrombocytopenia (ITP).

In some individuals, it may be possible to perform partial splenectomy. A single report indicates failure of partial splenectomy (80 percent) to reduce the transfusion requirement of a four-year-old patient with PK deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pyruvate-kinase-deficiency/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Six months later, she successfully underwent total splenectomy and became transfusion independent.</p><p>The beneficial effect of splenectomy on hemolysis has been well documented. Typically, hemolysis and anemia are ameliorated but not entirely abated. In severe cases, the transfusion requirement is generally, but not invariably, abolished. Results of splenectomy in other family members may also be of major guidance in this matter.

Affected individuals are either homozygous for a single pathogenic variant or compound heterozygous for two different pathogenic variants. PK generates a molecule of ATP during glycolysis, and reduced ATP may contribute to hemolysis, although the exact mechanism for hemolysis remains unclear. PK-deficient RBCs show enhanced oxygen delivery for a given partial pressure of oxygen in the bloodstream; thus, anemia may be better tolerated than in other inherited hemolytic anemias. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PK deficiency is rare, with a prevalence estimated at &lt;51 cases per million population.

The three major presentations are with neonatal jaundice, chronic non-immune, non-spherocytic hemolytic anemia, and, rarely, symptoms of iron overload. The severity of the anemia is variable, and the findings on the peripheral blood smear are nonspecific. (See <a href=\"#H3471078367\" class=\"local\">'Typical presentation and clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Testing for PK deficiency is appropriate in any sibling of a patient with PK deficiency who has unexplained anemia, or any individual with Coombs-negative hemolytic anemia and absence of morphologic abnormalities suggestive of other conditions (eg, absence of profound microcytosis, sickle cells, spherocytes, basophilic stippling, Heinz bodies) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F116947\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef116947 \">table 1</a>). Prenatal testing should be offered to parents who have had a child with hydrops fetalis or severe transfusion-dependent anemia not abrogated by splenectomy.

We prefer biochemical testing if possible because it is the most direct evidence of functional PK deficiency; genetic testing may be appropriate in selected cases. The gold standard biochemical test measures PK activity and estimates enzyme kinetics from RBCs free of contaminating white blood cells (WBCs), platelets, and the allosteric activator of PK activity, fructose 1,6-diphosphate (FDP); however, availability of this testing is very limited. An alternative is to use a rapid screening assay that is widely available in many commercial laboratories; this testing is reasonable with certain caveats.
