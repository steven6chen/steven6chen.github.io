The condition puts you at risk of stroke, heart attack, and other problems. Another term for atrial fibrillation is &quot;A-fib.&quot; If you have A-fib, you might:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feel as though your heart is racing, pounding, skipping beats, or beating out of sync</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have mild chest &quot;tightness,&quot; pain, or discomfort</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feel lightheaded, dizzy, or like you might pass out</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have trouble breathing, especially when you exercise</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H551670829\"><span class=\"h1\">Why do I need medicines to treat atrial fibrillation?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Having atrial fibrillation puts you at risk for a stroke and other problems. The medicines your doctor or nurse prescribes to treat atrial fibrillation can help lower the risk of these problems. They can also help reduce your symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H551670844\"><span class=\"h1\">Which medicines might I need?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are 3 main types of medicines for treating atrial fibrillation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F86624\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86624 \">table 1</a>). They include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Heart rate control medicines</strong> &ndash; These medicines include &quot;beta blockers&quot; like <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoprolol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">metoprolol</a> (brand names: Lopressor, Toprol XL) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carvedilol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">carvedilol</a> (Brand name: Coreg), and &quot;calcium channel blockers&quot; like <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diltiazem-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">diltiazem</a> (brand name: Cardizem). They work by slowing down the speed of your heartbeat.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Heart rhythm control medicines</strong> &ndash; These medicines include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">amiodarone</a> (brand names: Cordarone, Pacerone) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sotalol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">sotalol</a> (brand name: Betapace). They work by helping the heart switch back to and stay in a normal rhythm.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Anti-clotting medicines</strong> &ndash; These medicines make the blood less likely to clot. The oldest and most commonly used medicine is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">warfarin</a> (brand name: Coumadin). If you take warfarin, you'll need regular blood tests to monitor warfarin's effects.</p><p/><p>There are 4 newer anti-clotting medicines, too. They are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dabigatran-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">dabigatran</a> (brand name: Pradaxa), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=apixaban-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">apixaban</a> (brand name: Eliquis), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rivaroxaban-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">rivaroxaban</a> (brand name: Xarelto), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=edoxaban-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">edoxaban</a> (brand names: Savaysa, Lixiana). These medicines work as well as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">warfarin</a>, but they do not require regular blood tests (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F99882\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef99882 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>Most doctors prescribe heart rate control medicines for people with atrial fibrillation. Other people take rhythm control medicines instead. These medicines can be a better choice for people who still have symptoms when taking heart rate control medicines. Some people take both kinds of medicines.</p><p>Many people with atrial fibrillation take anti-clotting medicines to prevent a stroke. Doing this can prevent about 6 out of 10 strokes. There is a small risk of having a bleeding problem when taking an anti-clotting medicine.</p><p>Your doctor or nurse will decide which medicines are best for you depending on:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your age</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your symptoms and how often they occur</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Your other health problems, if you have any</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you already had a stroke</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How long you have had atrial fibrillation</p><p/><p>Your doctor will probably need to adjust the doses of your medicines a few times. Sometimes, people need to try several different medicines to find one that works best for them.</p><p>If your medicines cause troublesome side effects, or if you can't afford your medicines, talk to your doctor or nurse. There are often ways to deal with these problems. The first step is to let your doctor or nurse know.</p><p>For more detailed information about your medicines, ask your doctor or nurse for the patient hand-out from Lexicomp available through UpToDate. The Lexicomp hand-outs explain how to use and store your medicines. They also list possible side effects and warn you if your medicines should not be taken with certain other medicines or foods.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H551670876\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-fibrillation-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Atrial fibrillation (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-failure-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Heart failure (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=stroke-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Stroke (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=reducing-the-costs-of-medicines-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Reducing the costs of medicines (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=anti-clotting-medicines-warfarin-coumadin-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Anti-clotting medicines: Warfarin (Coumadin) (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=anti-clotting-medicines-direct-oral-anticoagulants-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Anti-clotting medicines: Direct oral anticoagulants (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=atrial-fibrillation-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Atrial fibrillation (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=stroke-symptoms-and-diagnosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Stroke symptoms and diagnosis (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=reducing-the-costs-of-medicines-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Reducing the costs of medicines (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
