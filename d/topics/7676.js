In the largest study, which involved over 120,000 women, increasing age was associated with the following treatment trends [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-on-the-treatment-of-early-stage-and-locally-advanced-breast-cancer-in-older-women/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased surgical rates &ndash; While over 93 percent of women &lt;80 years underwent surgery, the surgical rates were 83, 65, and 41 percent for women 80 to 84, 85 to 89, and &ge;90 years, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Less frequent use of adjuvant radiation therapy (RT) following breast conservation surgery &ndash; RT was administered in &gt;90, 86, 71, 36, and 15 percent of women &lt;75 years, 75 to 79, 80 to 84, 85 to 89, and &ge;90 years.

This ranged from &lt;1 percent among women less than 65 years to 47 percent among women 90 years or older.</p><p/><p>Variations in treatment patterns among older and younger women may be due to differences in breast cancer features, presence of competing comorbidities, and the general health status of women. There may be different treatment options for patients who are medically fit versus frail. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Factors that may affect treatment decisions'</a> below and <a href=\"#H184391652\" class=\"local\">'Medically fit'</a> below and <a href=\"#H184391833\" class=\"local\">'Medically frail'</a> below.)</p><p>In addition, older women have generally not participated in clinical trials evaluating the treatment of breast cancer, partially due to eligibility criteria that may have excluded elderly patients, but also because historically, they were systematically excluded from trials (eg, presence of comorbidities) and because they tend to be treated in centers where clinical trials are not available. As a result, there is a lack of evidence-based guidelines to inform the treatment of breast cancer in this population.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT TREATMENT DECISIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The higher prevalence of indolent tumor types among older women with breast cancer <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the presence of other comorbid (and potentially life-threatening) medical conditions may explain treatment trends in which standard components of breast cancer treatment are omitted. These include:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H518871776\"><span class=\"h2\">Tumor biology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most studies, the prevalence of tumors with more indolent features is higher in older compared with younger women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-on-the-treatment-of-early-stage-and-locally-advanced-breast-cancer-in-older-women/abstract/7-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-11</a>]. As an example, in a combined series of women aged 55 or older with breast cancer derived from the San Antonio Breast Cancer Database (n = 35,154) and the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) registry (n = 171,424), breast cancers diagnosed in older women had lower proliferative indices, normal p53 expression, and diploid DNA, compared with the cancers diagnosed in younger women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-on-the-treatment-of-early-stage-and-locally-advanced-breast-cancer-in-older-women/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Other differences include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Higher rates of hormone receptor expression &ndash; Breast cancers in older women express estrogen (ER) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> progesterone (PR) receptors more often than those of younger women (85 versus 70 percent in women &ge;65 versus &lt;50 years, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-on-the-treatment-of-early-stage-and-locally-advanced-breast-cancer-in-older-women/abstract/7-9,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9,12</a>].

In general, advancing age is associated with reduced tolerance to physiologic stress, higher prevalence of comorbidity, reduced social support (eg, access to transportation), cognitive impairment, and frailty [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-on-the-treatment-of-early-stage-and-locally-advanced-breast-cancer-in-older-women/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

Therefore, the life expectancy of a woman should be considered when formulating treatment plans. An online tool called <a href=\"http://eprognosis.ucsf.edu/&amp;token=FEE6F0JlRVF1b9TeuaII9KQd7CLxTAQWAQ1djW/ZYbXIC4LkjJFTXUWC0NEtoVA7&amp;TOPIC_ID=757\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">ePrognosis</a> estimates life expectancy based on medical history, and therefore may help frame treatment decisions; however, ePrognosis should be used with caution given lack of proven validity in cancer patients. </p><p>The impact of a breast cancer diagnosis on life expectancy was addressed in a study that used the linked SEER-Medicare dataset to compare the survival of 66,000 women 67 years of age and older who were diagnosed with breast cancer, with that of controls without breast cancer matched for age, comorbidity, prior mammography use, and social demographics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-on-the-treatment-of-early-stage-and-locally-advanced-breast-cancer-in-older-women/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The main results with a median follow-up of eight years were:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) or stage I invasive breast cancer had a lower risk of death compared with controls (adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.7, 95% CI 0.7-0.7 for DCIS; HR 0.8, 95% CI 0.8-0.8 for stage I breast cancer). Cardiovascular disease was the most common cause of death in these women.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women diagnosed with stage II disease or higher had an increased risk of death compared with controls (HR 1.2, 95% CI 1.2-1.2), regardless of age.

Comorbidity is characterized as the number and effect of an individual's other physical and psychological diseases in addition to the condition for which he or she is seeking treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-on-the-treatment-of-early-stage-and-locally-advanced-breast-cancer-in-older-women/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The presence of comorbidity is independently associated with decreased life expectancy and plays a major role in determining survival in older patients with cancer. (See <a href=\"#H19475397\" class=\"local\">'Functional status'</a> below.) </p><p>Comorbid conditions that impose functional limitations are associated with higher mortality (from breast cancer and non-breast-cancer causes), particularly if they are expected to worsen over time (eg, diabetes with end-organ damage, steroid- or oxygen-dependent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or dementia) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-on-the-treatment-of-early-stage-and-locally-advanced-breast-cancer-in-older-women/abstract/22-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22-24</a>]. In one study of over 64,000 women with breast cancer (median age, 75), the adjusted HR of death (from all causes) increased as the severity of comorbidity increased (measured using the Charlson Comorbidity Index Score (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F72047\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72047 \">table 2</a>)) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-on-the-treatment-of-early-stage-and-locally-advanced-breast-cancer-in-older-women/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>] compared with patients with no comorbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-on-the-treatment-of-early-stage-and-locally-advanced-breast-cancer-in-older-women/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Index score 1 &ndash; HR 1.45 (95% CI 1.41-1.48)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Index score 2 &ndash; HR 2.12 (95% CI 2.05-2.20) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Index score &ge;3 &ndash; HR 3.19 (95% CI 3.06-3.32)</p><p/><p>These data emphasize the importance of comorbidity in the treatment of older women with breast cancer. Therefore, all older women should undergo a pretreatment evaluation including an assessment of organ function and comorbidity, which may impact the ability of patients to tolerate surgery or anti-cancer therapies, and in particular, chemotherapy. A discussion on organ function in older women is covered separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=systemic-chemotherapy-for-cancer-in-elderly-persons\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Systemic chemotherapy for cancer in elderly persons&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other examples of brief comorbidity assessment tools include the Cumulative Index Rating Scale-Geriatric (CIRS-G) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-on-the-treatment-of-early-stage-and-locally-advanced-breast-cancer-in-older-women/abstract/25-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">25-36</a>] and the physical health section of the Older American Resources and Services (OARS) survey [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-on-the-treatment-of-early-stage-and-locally-advanced-breast-cancer-in-older-women/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19475397\"><span class=\"h3\">Functional status</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with a poor functional status may be at greater risk of death from a cause other than breast cancer, which suggests that such patients may not benefit from breast cancer treatment, especially adjuvant systemic therapy.</p><p>Functional status refers to one's ability to perform routine daily tasks. As with comorbidity, the presence of functional limitations is independently associated with worse life expectancy (from any cause) and plays a major role in determining overall survival in older patients, although it does not necessarily impact breast cancer-specific survival. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Comorbidity'</a> above.) </p><p>The impact of functional status was shown in a study of 2202 women with breast cancer who had completed adjuvant treatment and provided information on endurance, muscular range of motion, and dexterity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-on-the-treatment-of-early-stage-and-locally-advanced-breast-cancer-in-older-women/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. The presence of functional limitations was significantly associated with older age, less education, and obesity. With a median follow-up of nine years, patients with functional limitations had an increased risk of death from all causes (HR 1.40, 95% CI 1.03-1.92) and competing causes (HR 2.60, 95% CI 1.69-3.98), but not from breast cancer (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.64-1.26).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H518874633\"><span class=\"h3\">Frailty</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among older patients with breast cancer, frailty is associated with an increased risk of treatment-related complications, including a higher likelihood of requiring hospitalization and decreased overall survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-on-the-treatment-of-early-stage-and-locally-advanced-breast-cancer-in-older-women/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Frailty is characterized by decreased reserve and diminished resistance to stressors, which results from cumulative declines across multiple physiologic systems and can lead to increased susceptibility to adverse outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-on-the-treatment-of-early-stage-and-locally-advanced-breast-cancer-in-older-women/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

Online and PREDICT provide information on the survival benefit provided by adjuvant therapy. A clinician can use both prediction models, with the knowledge of the limitations in both. PREDICT (<a href=\"http://www.predict.nhs.uk/predict_v2.0.html&amp;token=nQSguVzTjd5giRWjBYiQc+bzNrGo30TgN5IYWEhvUqoVpQV1TZxvo3zGylMy4t+x&amp;TOPIC_ID=757\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">http://www.predict.nhs.uk/predict_v2.0.html</a>) tool results could be used as a starting point for overall survival estimates, with the knowledge that older women were included in model building. Adjuvant! Online may then be used to compare overall survival prediction results and incorporate breast cancer-specific mortality or recurrence in the treatment discussion. </p><p>Adjuvant! Online provides estimates of cancer recurrence and survival based on individual and tumor-specific characteristics, including comorbidity. In one study, the validity of Adjuvant! Online was evaluated using a population-based cohort that included over 2000 women (median age = 74 years) diagnosed with breast cancer between 1997 and 2004 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-on-the-treatment-of-early-stage-and-locally-advanced-breast-cancer-in-older-women/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. Adjuvant! Online predictions for 10-year overall survival (OS) and cumulative recurrence were compared with observed survival and recurrence rates in two models, one using comorbidity as &quot;average for age&quot; across the group (model 1), and another having comorbidity category determined by an &quot;expert panel&quot; (model 2). With a median follow-up of 9.0 years for OS and 6.6 years for patients without recurrence, the major findings were as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When comorbidity was set as &quot;average for age&quot; across the group, Adjuvant! Online overestimated 10-year recurrence risk by about 10 percent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When comorbidity level was assigned by an &quot;expert panel&quot;, Adjuvant! Online underestimated 10-year OS by 17 percent but accurately predicted 10-year cumulative recurrence.</p><p/><p>One potential flaw in this analysis is the confounding of treatment. Eight hundred and twenty seven (44 percent) received hormonal therapy, chemotherapy, or both. Therefore, the administration of systemic treatment could be a surrogate indicator of better health status or clinically determined more aggressive disease, thus influencing mortality and recurrence outcomes. Since most statistical and genomic tools used to estimate recurrence and survival are derived from clinical trials and cohorts that do not include large numbers of older patients, we recommend caution with using them as the only means by which to recommend additional therapy.</p><p>A newer tool has been created that included women 65 years and older in its development. PREDICT was developed using a cohort of women with early breast cancer in the United Kingdom (UK), with 32 percent of the exploratory cohort older than 65 years. The model was validated with another UK cohort that included 32 percent older women as well. The model is similar to Adjuvant! Online but, interestingly, does not include an input on comorbidity status, but incorporates mode of detection, HER2 status, and Ki67 level in its model.

In addition, we advocate a two-step approach using a brief screening tool for geriatric syndromes (including frailty) in all patients. Based on the results of the screening, a Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F71535\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71535 \">table 3</a>) may help clinicians develop a coordinated plan for breast cancer treatment.</p><p>In practice, the vast majority of elderly oncology care is performed in the community, not in regional or academic centers. As a result, the workload related to performance of a CGA may be overwhelming. Thus, a screening test would be useful, especially if it could identify the best (fit) and the worst (frail) patients immediately, and those in whom treatment decisions could be readily made (ie, fit patients could proceed directly to anticancer treatment; frail patients could proceed to palliative or supportive care). For those who are in the middle, CGA may identify potentially correctable issues where interventions are available. However, it is unknown how or whether tailored geriatric interventions influence outcome.

Because of their length and construct (which may require self-report and interviewer-obtained measures to complete), they have not been widely adopted into clinical oncology practice. Instead, their use is more often limited to multidisciplinary centers where geriatrician support is also present.

At a median follow-up of 2.4 years, standard chemotherapy was associated with higher rates of relapse-free survival (85 versus 68 percent) and overall survival (91 versus 86 percent) at three years. These results are in line with the ICE study, which randomly assigned 1380 women aged 65 years or older with node-positive or high-risk, node-negative breast cancer to capecitabine or no capecitabine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-on-the-treatment-of-early-stage-and-locally-advanced-breast-cancer-in-older-women/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>].

At three years, there was no statistical difference for the primary endpoint of disease-free survival with the addition of capecitabine (85 versus 84 percent) or at five years (79 percent versus 75 percent).

For example, in one study that included 348 elderly cancer patients, increased toxicity to chemotherapy was predicted by low nutritional status (as evaluated using the Mini Nutritional Assessment [MNA]) and decreased mobility (evaluated using the timed Up and Go test) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/general-principles-on-the-treatment-of-early-stage-and-locally-advanced-breast-cancer-in-older-women/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

The model on which CRASH was based used clinical and laboratory data and information derived from the Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment (CGA) plus a mathematical score (called Chemotox) derived based on the average of the two highest-frequency grade 4 hematologic and grade &ge;3 non-hematologic toxicities using data from published clinical trials.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The investigators reported that separate factors predicted hematologic and non-hematologic toxicities:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For hematologic toxicity, the Instrumental Activities of Daily Living (IADL) score, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, diastolic blood pressure, and the Chemotox score were predictive.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For non-hematologic toxicity, risk was predicted by Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, Mini-Mental Status exam score, MNA score, and Chemotox.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">These factors were used to inform the subscores of CRASH, which were then combined into a total score &ge;3, which predicted greater than 50 percent of patients experiencing grade 4 hematologic or grade <span class=\"nowrap\">3/4</span> non-hematologic toxicity. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although promising, one of the limitations is that the CRASH score requires estimation of the Chemotox score for each specific chemotherapy regimen under consideration.
