In many instances, an ectopic ureter is not detected because the affected individual is asymptomatic. In other cases, especially in females, an ectopic ureter commonly presents with urinary incontinence; in both sexes, it may present as an antenatal diagnosis, urinary tract infection (UTI), or, rarely, urinary obstruction.</p><p>Ectopic ureter, including its pathophysiology, clinical presentation, diagnosis, evaluation, and management will be reviewed here.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An ectopic ureter forms when the origin of the ureteral bud from the mesonephric duct is abnormally high, and separation of the bud from the duct is delayed or does not occur (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F68944\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68944 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-ureter/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Ectopic ureters are commonly associated with a double (duplex) collecting system. In these cases, the double collecting system is thought to result from duplication of the ureteric bud. The cranial or superior ureteral bud is associated with the lower renal pole, and the caudal or inferior ureteral bud with the upper renal pole (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F68944\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef68944 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F86773\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86773 \">picture 1</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-congenital-anomalies-of-the-kidney-and-urinary-tract-cakut#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT)&quot;, section on 'Anomalies of the collecting system'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Ureteral orifice site</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The ectopic orifice is always found along the pathway of the developing mesonephric system.</p><p>In the male, the most common site is the posterior urethra, occurring in approximately 50 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-ureter/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Other sites include the seminal vesicle (approximately one-third), vas deferens, bladder neck, prostate to the level of the ejaculatory duct orifice, and epididymis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78218\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78218 \">figure 2</a>). The ectopic ureter is always above the external urinary sphincter. Therefore, males with an ectopic ureter do not have urinary incontinence, but typically present secondary to a prenatal diagnosis of hydroureteronephrosis or symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI).</p><p>In contrast, females (not detected by prenatal sonogram) present postnatally with a history of urinary incontinence, because their ectopic ureters terminate at sites that bypass the urethral external sphincter. The incontinence is typically characterized by persistent spotting or moisture, requiring the use of a pad within their underwear. Since the upper pole renal unit subtending the ectopic ureter is often dysplastic or poorly functioning, the amount of urine draining ectopically past the urinary sphincter is not voluminous. In addition, these patients void normally, since the ipsilateral lower pole unit drains normally into the bladder as well as the contralateral kidney. Some patients are unaware that they have an abnormality, and think that the constant low-level moisture from the urinary incontinence is normal.</p><p>The following are the most common terminal sites of female ureteric ectopy, including their relative frequency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-ureter/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F65413\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65413 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bladder neck and upper urethra &ndash; 33 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vaginal vestibule between the urethra and vaginal opening &ndash; 33 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61532\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61532 \">picture 2</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vagina &ndash; 25 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F95227\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef95227 \">image 1</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cervix and uterus &ndash; Less than 5 percent</p><p/><p>Only girls with a ureteral orifice site at or above the bladder neck and upper urethra will be continent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Single versus duplex system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In published case series from the United States and Great Britain, the majority of ectopic ureters are associated with a duplex kidney, with rates that vary from 75 to 90 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F50628\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50628 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-ureter/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. In these reports, ectopic ureters in duplex kidneys occur eight to nine times more frequently in girls than in boys.</p><p>In contrast, ectopic ureters associated with a single-kidney system appear to be more common in India and Japan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-ureter/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. In one study from India, 75 percent of the ectopic ureters were associated with a single-kidney system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-ureter/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In these case series, there was a strong female predominance. However, in reports from the United States and Great Britain, single-system ectopia is either equally or more likely to occur in males than in females [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-ureter/abstract/1,3,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,7,8</a>]. It remains unknown why there is this geographical difference in the incidence of single-system ectopia and the gender variation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-ureter/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. It may be related to genetic differences in the study population.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of ectopic ureters may be underestimated because many affected individuals are asymptomatic. The condition is found in autopsy series in 1 in 1900 cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-ureter/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Ectopic ureters occur approximately six times more commonly in females than in males. Approximately 10 percent of ectopic ureters are bilateral.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Prenatal presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ectopic ureter is increasingly being diagnosed by antenatal ultrasonography. In these cases, hydronephrosis is the usual presenting finding, most likely due to obstructed flow from narrowing of the ureter or bladder neck obstruction as the ectopic ureter passes through the muscle of the genitourinary diaphragm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-ureter/abstract/3,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Postnatal presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ectopic ureters present differently in toilet-trained males and females, primarily because in two-thirds of affected females, they bypass the external sphincter, resulting in incontinence, whereas the orifice of ectopic ureters in males is always proximal to the urinary sphincter.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Males</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In males, an ectopic ureter usually is detected during an evaluation for anatomic abnormalities following a urinary tract infection (UTI). Rarely, if the ureter enters the genital ducts, patients may present with epididymoorchitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-ureter/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Males never present with incontinence because the ectopic ureter is always proximal to the external urethral sphincter (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78218\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78218 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>Other presentations for boys with ectopic ureters include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-ureter/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flank pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sense of urgency or frequency in patients with ureteric termination in the posterior urethra</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In rare cases, newborn males with bladder outlet obstruction due to a dilated prostatic ectopic ureter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-ureter/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Females</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In infancy, girls usually present with UTI. However, after toilet training, girls generally present with incontinence because, in most cases, the site of insertion of the ectopic ureter is distal to or bypasses the external sphincter, usually ending in the vaginal vestibule or vagina (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F65413\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65413 \">figure 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F95227\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef95227 \">image 1</a>). The parents typically report that the girl has normal voiding habits, but is always wet. She may become wetter when she is sitting on the parent's lap because of urine pooling in the dilated ureter or vagina. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Ureteral orifice site'</a> above.)</p><p>Some older girls may present with pyelonephritis, which more likely occurs in patients with a dysplastic kidney and dilated ectopic ureter. Infection results from urinary stasis and obstruction.

These abnormalities often present during puberty with an ectopic ureter from a minimally functioning hypoplastic renal nubbin, which is associated with obstructed hemivagina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-ureter/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. This constellation of findings has been referred to as obstructed hemivagina and ipsilateral renal agenesis (OHVIRA) syndrome. However, cases from our center have demonstrated an ipsilateral dysplastic and atrophic kidney rather than renal agenesis, which was confirmed by the persistent excretion of dilute urine after resection of the obstructing vaginal septum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F86776\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86776 \">figure 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-ureter/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Atrophic kidneys may not be detected by a <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dimercaptosuccinic-acid-succimer-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">dimercaptosuccinic acid</a> (DMSA) renal scan and can also be difficult to localize on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). As a result, increased clinical awareness of possible M&uuml;llerian abnormalities is needed in female patients with alleged renal agenesis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS AND EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnostic tests</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis is made by imaging studies that identify the ectopic ureter.</p><p>Renal ultrasound is the initial diagnostic test (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F86775\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef86775 \">image 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F95227\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef95227 \">image 1</a>). The ureter is often dilated down to its abnormally low position. In many cases, the ureter may be followed proximally to a dysplastic or normal upper segment moiety of a duplex system. In single-system ectopia, the kidney may be dysplastic and difficult to visualize.</p><p>Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with contrast is helpful (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F95227\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef95227 \">image 1</a>), especially in suspected cases of ectopic ureters and a normal ultrasound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-ureter/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. For example, a nondilated ectopic ureter associated with the upper pole of a duplex renal system may not be visible on renal ultrasound. In this case, the only ultrasound finding may be a discrepancy in renal length. In these patients, MRI and CT generally will pinpoint the location of the ureter, and confirm the diagnosis of a nondilated upper pole ureter draining ectopically.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Further evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A voiding cystourethrogram (VCUG) should be performed when the diagnosis of an ectopic ureter is considered. We recommend the use of cyclic VCUG, which more reliably detects reflux into the ectopic ureter compared with a standard VCUG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-ureter/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>A renal scan is used to assess renal function prior to surgery, as the function of the renal moiety associated with the ectopic ureter will impact surgical decisions. In patients with dysplastic kidneys that have little function, a static renal scan that uses the isotope <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dimercaptosuccinic-acid-succimer-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">dimercaptosuccinic acid</a> (DMSA) (when available) may be more helpful to locate a poorly functioning ectopic kidney than the dynamic scan that uses technetium-99m-mercaptoacetyltriglycine (Tc99mMAG3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-ureter/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. In patients with hydronephrosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dilated ureter, diuretic renography (renal scan and the administration of a diuretic) is performed to diagnose urinary obstruction. Diuretic renography is described in detail separately.

Excision of this segment along with the proximal ureter is usually curative. When the upper pole has good function, the ectopic ureter is reimplanted into the bladder or anastomosed outside the bladder to the normal pole ureter (ureteroureterostomy).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Single system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with an ectopic ureter in a single system, the affected kidney is usually small and poorly functional, and the base of the bladder (hemitrigone) is poorly developed. Management usually consists of nephrourecterectomy. If the kidney is functional, the treatment is resection of the distal ectopic ureter and reimplantation into the bladder.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In children with ectopic ureters, long-term surgical outcome is excellent, with resolution of incontinence in almost all affected patients, and decreased rates of urinary tract infection (UTI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-ureter/abstract/2,4,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,8</a>]. However, patients with either bladder outlet obstruction or bilateral single-system ectopic ureter may have voiding dysfunction <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> small bladders with inadequate capacity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ectopic-ureter/abstract/8,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,17,18</a>].
