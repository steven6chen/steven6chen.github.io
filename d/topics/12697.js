During episodes of acute respiratory failure, patients are generally ventilated through an endotracheal tube. Changing to a tracheostomy tube is often considered when the need for mechanical ventilation is expected to be prolonged. An overview of clinical issues related to tracheostomy will be discussed here. General issues regarding endotracheal intubation and prolonged ventilation are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-the-endotracheal-tube-following-initial-placement-prevention-and-management-in-adult-intensive-care-unit-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of the endotracheal tube following initial placement: Prevention and management in adult intensive care unit patients&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-difficult-to-wean-adult-patient-in-the-intensive-care-unit\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the difficult-to-wean adult patient in the intensive care unit&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-prognosis-of-patients-requiring-prolonged-mechanical-ventilation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and prognosis of patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TRACHEOSTOMY VERSUS INTUBATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The relative advantages and disadvantages of tracheostomy and endotracheal intubation are outlined in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F76699\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76699 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Work of breathing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data from small studies suggest that work of breathing, pressure-time product, airway resistance, peak inspiratory pressures, and intrinsic positive end-expiratory pressure (ie, auto-PEEP) decrease after tracheostomy in both ventilated and spontaneously breathing patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tracheostomy/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. As a result, standard weaning parameters such as the rapid shallow breathing index improve in difficult to wean patients following the conversion from endotracheal tube to tracheostomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tracheostomy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In addition, ventilator synchrony and triggering may be enhanced, although tidal volume, respiratory rate, and dead space ventilation remain unchanged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tracheostomy/abstract/1,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6</a>]. These changes &ndash; along with other variables such as secretion, clearance, and patient comfort &ndash; may facilitate weaning from mechanical ventilation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Aspiration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aspiration of oropharyngeal contents is common with both tracheostomy and endotracheal intubation. It is a result of both pharyngeal pooling of secretions above the airway cuff and delayed triggering of the swallow response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tracheostomy/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. The risk of aspiration is directly related to the amount of oropharyngeal secretions.</p><p>Videofluoroscopic studies have failed to demonstrate an alteration in swallowing mechanics just prior to decannulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tracheostomy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, in patients who have a tracheostomy, aspiration occurs in 30 to 50 percent and is clinically silent in 75 to 82 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tracheostomy/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. Occlusion of the tracheostomy with a cap or finger for phonation does not significantly increase the frequency of aspiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tracheostomy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The likelihood of aspiration may decrease somewhat after a tracheostomy has been present for three weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tracheostomy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>In patients who are intubated, the type of endotracheal tube cuff affects the ability of fluid to leak around the endotracheal tube into the lower airway from the posterior pharynx. Polyurethane cuffs reduce the amount of leakage compared with polyvinyl chloride endotracheal tubes, although the clinical importance of this is unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tracheostomy/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. PEEP may also reduce the amount of fluid leakage. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-factors-and-prevention-of-hospital-acquired-and-ventilator-associated-pneumonia-in-adults#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk factors and prevention of hospital-acquired and ventilator-associated pneumonia in adults&quot;, section on 'Subglottic drainage'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Detection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several methods have been used to detect aspiration in patients with tracheal tubes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylene-blue-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Methylene blue</a> &ndash; During the methylene blue test, dye is added to enteral feedings and then sought in tracheal secretions. Detection of the dye in tracheal secretions is suggestive of aspiration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tracheostomy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. However, the accuracy of the methylene blue test for identifying aspiration is uncertain. One study found a sensitivity of 100 percent in mechanically ventilated patients and 82 percent in all patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tracheostomy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Another study reported a 50 percent false negative rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tracheostomy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glucose oxidase testing &ndash; The glucose oxidase test uses test strips and a calibrated glucose meter to measure glucose in tracheal secretions (elevated glucose in the tracheal secretions is considered suggestive of aspiration). Aspiration can be more easily detected by glucose oxidase testing than by the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylene-blue-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylene blue</a> test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tracheostomy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Direct visualization &ndash; Direct visualization methods remain the gold standard for detecting aspiration of oropharyngeal contents in patients with tracheostomies.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient communication</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonverbal communication can prove frustrating for patients with prolonged respiratory failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tracheostomy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Patient communication can be greatly enhanced following tracheostomy by use of specialized appliances, such as the Portex &quot;Talk&quot; tube and the Communitrach I. These utilize an additional small diameter tube that expels gas above the cuff of the tracheostomy tube when the proximal end has been manually occluded (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F60668\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60668 \">figure 1</a>). Limitations of this device include the requirement for manual occlusion and the frequent inability to speak in complete sentences. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-difficult-to-wean-adult-patient-in-the-intensive-care-unit\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the difficult-to-wean adult patient in the intensive care unit&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Passy-Muir one-way valves can also be employed to facilitate audible phonation, although the tracheostomy cuff must be deflated to permit this to occur (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F61596\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61596 \">figure 2</a>). One series showed that tidal volume must be increased an average of 50 percent when using a Passy-Muir valve to achieve the same peak airway pressure obtained before the tracheostomy cuff was deflated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tracheostomy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, increasing the tidal volume by less than this amount usually permits both adequate ventilation and phonation. Alternatively, bilevel positive airway pressure can be provided using PEEP in conjunction with pressure support ventilation (PSV). This pressure-limited approach to ventilation avoids the need to adjust tidal volumes prior to speaking, and may result in improved phonation, particularly for patients with neuromuscular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tracheostomy/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].</p><p>A novel voice tracheostomy tube has been developed for use by patients on mechanical ventilation who require low levels of PEEP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tracheostomy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The cuff is constructed to inflate during inspiration and deflate on expiration, allowing phonation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Nosocomial pneumonia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among patients who have undergone tracheostomy, several factors may predict nosocomial pneumonia following tracheostomy. In a retrospective study of 137 patients who underwent tracheostomy, early nosocomial pneumonia (occurring within 5 days of tracheostomy) was associated with significant bacterial colonization (&gt;100,000 <span class=\"nowrap\">cfu/mL),</span> fever on the day of tracheostomy, and the need for sedation beyond 24 hours after tracheostomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tracheostomy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. There was a 26 percent incidence of pneumonia in the study population, occurring at a mean of nine days after the tracheostomy.</p><p>It is unclear whether tracheostomy alters the rate of nosocomial pneumonia because there are conflicting data:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suggesting that tracheostomy is associated with a higher rate of nosocomial pneumonia, a prospective cohort study of over 800 mechanically ventilated patients found that tracheostomy was independently associated with a six-fold increase in the risk of nosocomial pneumonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tracheostomy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suggesting that tracheostomy is associated with a lower rate of nosocomial pneumonia, a case-control study of 354 patients who were mechanically ventilated for more than seven days found a lower rate of nosocomial pneumonia following tracheostomy (4.8 versus 9.2 episodes per 1000 ventilator days in patients ventilated for an equivalent duration who did not undergo tracheostomy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tracheostomy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. These findings were supported by a retrospective cohort study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tracheostomy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p>The timing of tracheostomy (early versus late) does not appear to impact the rate of nosocomial pneumonia following tracheostomy, according to a randomized trial and two observational studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tracheostomy/abstract/26-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">TIMING OF TRACHEOSTOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients who are unable to wean from invasive ventilation within one to three weeks of intubation, tracheostomy and transfer to a long-term assisted care (LTAC) facility is often considered. There is no optimal time for this transition with practice-pattern variation among physicians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tracheostomy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. The decision should be individualized according to the clinical circumstances and the patient's preference such that daily assessment of a patient's progress, readiness to wean, and need for tracheostomy is warranted. The evidence regarding optimal timing for tracheostomy is reviewed here. The advantages and disadvantages of tracheostomy are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Tracheostomy versus intubation'</a> above.)</p><p>Many clinicians believe that patients should not be ventilated via an endotracheal tube for longer than three weeks unless they are either unstable or unlikely to benefit from tracheostomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tracheostomy/abstract/31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">31-33</a>]. This view is based upon the observation that tracheostomy enhances nursing care, improves patient comfort, reduces the need for sedation, and improves patient communication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tracheostomy/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. An international multicenter study of 1638 patients suggested that this view is widespread, finding that tracheostomy was performed after a median of only 11 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tracheostomy/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Late tracheostomy was traditionally defined as a tracheostomy performed at three weeks, but more recent studies have defined late tracheostomy as that performed as early as one or two weeks. Not supported by data, there has been a paradigm shift in practice toward early tracheostomy, the timing of which is equally as poorly defined (2 to 14 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tracheostomy/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. However, data from observational series, randomized trials, and meta-analyses have been unhelpful in determining a benefit from early tracheostomy in terms of mortality, length of stay and mechanical ventilation days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tracheostomy/abstract/28,29,36-45\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29,36-45</a>]. In a multicenter trial, 1032 adult patients on mechanical ventilation for up to four days were randomly assigned to either early tracheostomy (within four days of admission) or late tracheostomy (10 or more days after randomization) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tracheostomy/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. The timing of tracheostomy did not appear to impact 30 day or 2 year mortality or intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay. In addition, over half of the subjects randomized to the late tracheostomy arm never received the intervention. This suggests that postponing tracheostomy allows a subset of patients to avoid the intervention and that investigators were unable to identify those likely to require long term ventilation. Thus, data remains insufficient to show clear benefit to early tracheostomy (within four days) for mechanically ventilated patients in the ICU. </p><p>Nevertheless, some evidence suggests that tracheostomy performed at seven days may improve some short-term clinical outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tracheostomy/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. These findings were illustrated by a multicenter trial that randomly assigned 419 mechanically ventilated patients to undergo either early or late tracheostomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tracheostomy/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. When compared with late tracheostomy (mean 14 days), early tracheostomy (mean 7 days) was associated with the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A higher likelihood of weaning from the ventilator (77 versus 68 percent) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A higher likelihood of being discharged from the ICU within 28 days (48 versus 39 percent) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A trend towards a lower rate of pneumonia (14 versus 21 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar survival at one month </p><p/><p>Adverse events occurred in 39 percent of patients who underwent tracheostomy, most frequently hypoxemia, stoma inflammation, stoma infection, and bleeding. Finally, early tracheostomy did not change any outcomes at one year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tracheostomy/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The major limitation of this trial was that many patients (31 and 43 percent in the early and late tracheostomy groups, respectively) did not undergo tracheostomy.</p><p>Presently the question of early versus late tracheostomy remains unresolved in the medical literature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tracheostomy/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Although a recent meta-analysis demonstrated better outcomes with earlier tracheostomy, it also demonstrated that early tracheostomy studies are associated with higher rates of tracheostomy, suggesting that better outcomes may be influenced by the better outcomes of patients who might otherwise have avoided a tracheostomy altogether [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tracheostomy/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Although no optimal time has been identified, we typically do not perform a tracheostomy before seven to ten days of mechanical ventilation. This preference is based on the rationale that early tracheostomy is of no proven benefit, and may lead to unnecessary surgery and prolonged mechanical ventilation in patients that may otherwise be extubated.</p><p>The decision of when to perform tracheostomy is a collaborative one and should be part of the overall approach to patient and family centered care rendered in the intensive care unit. The value of tracheostomy can be discussed with the patient and family (or care-giver) in the context of the likelihood of weaning, patient preferences, and expected outcomes, together with the alternatives of continued care or palliation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tracheostomy/abstract/47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">47,48</a>].

It appears to be safe when performed by surgeons or well-trained critical care clinicians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tracheostomy/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].

The snugly fitting stomal tissue tract around the tracheostomy tube may be less prone to stomal infection. In addition, there is the potential for less postoperative hemorrhage, because blood vessels are compressed rather than ligated or cauterized. However, one prospective, nonrandomized case series found that the conical dilator technique resulted in a greater number of bronchoscopically evident tracheal ring fractures than stepwise dilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tracheostomy/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>].</p><p>A second single-dilator set, PercuTwist (Rusch International), which employs a screw-like dilator using a rotational technique, was inferior to the Ciaglia technique using the Blue Rhino device in a small randomized, observational trial of 70 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tracheostomy/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. The overall complication rate was the same in both groups, however, two cases of posterior tracheal wall injury occurred with the PercuTwist technique. All 35 tracheostomies performed using the Blue Rhino device and Cigalia technique were successful, but 8 of 35 attempts using the PercuTwist device failed to cannulate the trachea.</p><p>Endoscopic guidance can be utilized to help ensure proper partial withdrawal of the endotracheal tube and placement of the tracheostomy tube [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tracheostomy/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. This may be particularly relevant in situations of limited operator experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tracheostomy/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. Even so, endoscopic guidance is no guarantee of proper tracheostomy placement. Examination of patients following percutaneous tracheostomy using the Griggs approach and endoscopic guidance found that only 6 of 19 patients had their tracheostomy located between the first and second tracheal rings; five patients had tracheostomies between the cricoid cartilage and the first tracheal ring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tracheostomy/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>]. Tracheal ring fractures causing subclinical tracheal deformities and low-grade tracheal stenosis were also noted in this study.</p><p>Following percutaneous tracheostomy, a routine chest radiograph is probably unnecessary, provided the procedure had been uncomplicated. In a retrospective review of 60 patients undergoing tracheostomy with bronchoscopic guidance, a post-procedure chest radiograph was only useful in detecting complications following procedures deemed difficult by an experienced operator [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tracheostomy/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">OUTCOME FOLLOWING TRACHEOSTOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patient comfort is an immediate benefit of tracheostomy.

There was also no difference in ICU mortality when early tracheostomy was compared to late tracheostomy. Post-ICU mortality was higher among those who underwent tracheostomy, particularly those in whom the tracheostomy tube was left in position. This finding may be due to the comorbidities that are more common among patients who cannot be decannulated and that predispose to a poor outcome, rather than the tracheostomy itself.</p><p/><p>The ability to wean from mechanical ventilation following tracheostomy may be predictive of mortality. In a retrospective series of 429 patients who underwent tracheostomy for respiratory failure, mortality was low at one year (8 percent) in patients liberated from mechanical ventilation and decannulated, but remained high in patients who required ongoing mechanical ventilation (57 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tracheostomy/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. Among the 191 patients who were weaned but still had a tracheostomy tube in place at discharge, subsequent successful decannulation was associated with the absence of hypertension, the ability to walk in the hospital hallway, and the ability to eat without tube feedings prior to discharge.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H859319765\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common acute (eg, first few days) complications include obstruction and pneumothorax as well as postoperative hemorrhage and infection. &#160;</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Obstruction</strong> &ndash; Percutaneous tracheostomy tubes can become partially obstructed by the posterior membranous trachea following initial placement, although symptomatic obstruction is uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-tracheostomy/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>].

Tracheoarterial fistulas are due to erosion from the tube tip or cuff into the anterior wall of the trachea resulting in a fistulous communication with the innominate artery as it passes anteriorly across the trachea. Patients may develop a &quot;sentinel&quot; bleed followed by massive hemoptysis. Diagnosis is dependent upon a high index of suspicion and when suspected, immediate action should be undertaken to stop the bleeding since diagnostic modalities such as angiography or bronchoscopy may lead to delay and death.

It allows mechanical ventilation via a tracheostomy tube instead of an endotracheal tube. Tracheostomy is generally considered when the duration of mechanical ventilation is expected to be prolonged. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tracheostomy decreases the work of breathing and improves patient comfort when compared to an endotracheal tube. However, there is no conclusive proof that tracheostomy decreases the risk of aspiration or nosocomial pneumonia. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Tracheostomy versus intubation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The timing of tracheostomy should be individualized according to the clinical circumstances and the patient's preference such that daily assessment of a patient's progress, readiness to wean, and need for tracheostomy is warranted. In our practice, we typically do not perform a tracheostomy before seven to ten days of mechanical ventilation. This preference is based on the rationale that early tracheostomy is of no proven benefit, and may lead to unnecessary surgery and prolonged mechanical ventilation in patients that may otherwise be extubated. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Timing of tracheostomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Factors that increase the likelihood that a tracheostomy will be required include poor prehospitalization functional status, poor nutritional status, poor pulmonary function, advanced age, nosocomial pneumonia, administration of aerosol treatments, a witnessed aspiration event, or reintubation. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Timing of tracheostomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy is an alternative to surgical tracheostomy. Both techniques have a low risk of complications when performed by an experienced operator. Percutaneous tracheostomy is usually a shorter procedure, does not require an operating room, and may yield a better cosmetic result. However, the results vary according to the dilator that is used. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Tracheostomy Techniques'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tracheoinnominate fistula formation and massive hemorrhage occur in less than 1 percent of tracheostomies, but can be life-threatening. Other complications are also uncommon, including subcutaneous emphysema, pneumothorax, tracheal stenosis, and tracheal ring rupture. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decannulation can be performed when mechanical ventilation is no longer required, the cough is adequate, secretions are well controlled, and upper airway obstruction is absent. Readiness for decannulation can be assessed by progressively decreasing the size of the tracheostomy tube or by capping a fenestrated tube for progressively longer periods of time.
