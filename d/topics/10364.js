Day-to-day care is mostly directed towards improving symptoms, with many common interventions having little impact on long-term outcome. Most patients with BPD gradually improve as healing occurs and lung growth continues, but the time required for improvement varies widely. Management is also directed at minimizing further injury, providing an optimal environment to support growth and recovery, and detecting complications associated with BPD.</p><p>The management of BPD is reviewed here. Pathogenesis and clinical features, prognosis, and potential strategies to prevent BPD are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and clinical features of bronchopulmonary dysplasia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=outcome-of-infants-with-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Outcome of infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of bronchopulmonary dysplasia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">RESPIRATORY SUPPORT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Respiratory care is supportive and should minimize additional injury.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanical ventilation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with established bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) who require mechanical ventilation, small tidal volumes are preferable to avoid additional mechanical injury. However, airway dilation and dead space to tidal volume ratio increase with chronic mechanical ventilation in extremely low birth weight (ELBW) infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], and infants with severe BPD may require higher tidal volumes to maintain effective ventilation. In particular, infants with bronchomalacia may require prolonged use, as well as higher levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) to splint open large airways. In general, based on our clinical experience, maintaining a PEEP of 5 to 7 cm H<sub>2</sub>O minimizes atelectasis, and counters the development of pulmonary edema in infants with BPD. A slightly prolonged inspiratory duration of 0.4 to 0.5 seconds sometimes is needed to promote uniform lung inflation in patients who develop uneven airway obstruction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and clinical features of bronchopulmonary dysplasia&quot;, section on 'Mechanical ventilation'</a>.)</p><p>Ongoing assessment of ventilator-dependent infants includes continuous pulse oximetry to monitor oxygenation, and intermittent blood gas sampling to monitor pH and PaCO<sub>2</sub>. The frequency of monitoring depends on the clinical condition of the patient. PaCO<sub>2</sub> levels between 55 and 65 mmHg are tolerated as long as pH remains in the normal range (7.3 to 7.4). In patients with severe disease, PaCO<sub>2</sub> values up to 70 mmHg may be tolerated on occasion to avoid further escalation of ventilator support.</p><p>With growth and improving clinical condition, periodic attempts should be made to slowly wean ventilator support as tolerated. Infants who can maintain acceptable PaCO<sub>2</sub> levels with minimal ventilator support and without increased respiratory effort or tachypnea can be weaned to continuous positive airway pressure and then to supplemental oxygen alone.</p><p>Suctioning is associated with tracheal and bronchial injury. Suctioning is limited to only when it is needed, and ensuring that the passage of the suction catheter does not go beyond the distal tip of the endotracheal tube (&quot;calibrated suctioning&quot;) is recommended to avoid injury and protect the airway mucosa.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H42406315\"><span class=\"h3\">Prolonged ventilation and tracheostomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to ongoing lung injury, prolonged ventilation and intubation may be associated with acquired subglottic stenosis and laryngeal injury, especially in infants who require multiple intubations. The appropriate timing and indications of tracheostomy placement in infants requiring chronic ventilation remains poorly defined, as information is based on retrospective data [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>In a multicenter cohort study of 8683 infants born at &lt;30 weeks gestation and surviving to at least 36 weeks, tracheostomy was performed in 3.5 percent (n = 304) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. After adjustment for potential confounders, primary outcome of death or neurodevelopmental impairment (NDI) occurred more frequently among those receiving tracheostomy (odds ratio [OR] 3.3, 95% CI 2.4-4.6). However, the risk of death alone was lower in the group of infants who underwent tracheostomy (OR 0.4, 95% CI 0.3-0.7). The composite outcome of death or NDI before 120 days of life was lower in the tracheostomy group (OR 0.5, 95% CI 0.3-0.9).</p><p>Predictors for tracheostomy were noted in a smaller multicenter study of 868 infants (mean gestational age 26 weeks) with severe BPD, in which 12 percent of the cohort underwent tracheostomy (n = 104) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. These included the presence of clinical pulmonary <span class=\"nowrap\">hypertension/cor</span> pulmonale, ongoing mechanical ventilation, age at the time of referral, and increasing gestational age at birth. The unexpected finding of increased gestational age as a predictor may reflect death before referral for tracheostomy of the most immature infants or different underlying physiology in later gestation infants with severe disease.</p><p>These results suggest that earlier tracheostomy in patients who require prolonged ventilation may be beneficial. In our practice we typically begin to consider tracheostomy in infants who are 40 to 42 weeks postmenstrual age and are expected to need continued ventilator support. However, it is clear more information is needed to determine the optimal timing and indications of tracheostomy in infants with BPD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Oxygen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Supplemental oxygen is used to ensure adequate tissue oxygenation and avoid alveolar hypoxia, which increases pulmonary vascular resistance, potentially leading to the development of cor pulmonale [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Hypoxemia also may increase airway resistance in infants with BPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>However, increases in inspired oxygen concentrations, even small changes, may have a negative impact on the clinical course, such as increasing the risk of retinopathy of prematurity or exacerbating pulmonary inflammation or pulmonary edema.</p><p>Thus, the use of supplemental oxygen is challenging in preterm infants with BPD, because of the competing needs of avoiding both hypoxia and exposure to excess oxygen. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-clinical-features-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and clinical features of bronchopulmonary dysplasia&quot;, section on 'Oxygen toxicity'</a>.)</p><p>Determining the optimal range of oxygen saturation for preterm infants who receive supplemental oxygen is an ongoing active area of research. Guidelines for targeted oxygen saturation goals continue to evolve with the accumulation of new evidence. The challenges including a description of the available data in determining oxygen target levels are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-target-oxygen-levels-for-preterm-infants#H3158632412\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal target oxygen levels for preterm infants&quot;, section on 'Oxygen target levels'</a>.)</p><p>Based upon the evidence, we recommend an oxygen saturation target range of 90 to 95 percent for preterm infants. Once an infant with BPD reaches term and achieves mature retinal vascularization (as documented by ophthalmologic examination), we recommend supplemental oxygen to maintain SpO<sub>2</sub> values of 95 percent or greater [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Further discussion of oxygen use and the impact on pulmonary artery hypertension is included below. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Pulmonary artery hypertension'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">NUTRITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nutrition is provided to meet the increased total energy needs of infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and ensure appropriate growth. Total energy needs in some infants may increase to 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/kg</span> per day, and protein intake of 3.5 to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg</span> per day is needed. Because fluid intake is often restricted, the desired nutrients may need to be contained in a reduced volume of feeding. (See <a href=\"#H116889602\" class=\"local\">'Growth'</a> below and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Fluid restriction'</a> below.)</p><p>We recommend infants with BPD receive fortified human milk that is supplemented to meet their needs for adequate growth because of the intrinsic benefits of human milk. If fluid restriction below 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> is needed, commercially available human milk fortifier can be added to increase caloric density to 24, 27, or 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/oz</span>. An alternative option that we consider is to alternate feeds between fortified human milk and preterm formula with a higher nutrient density.</p><p>In the nutritional management of infants with BPD, regular consultation with a pediatric nutritionist experienced in the management of these chronically ill infants is helpful. Consultation with an experienced clinician (occupational <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> speech therapist) is useful to assess and manage feeding difficulties often present in these infants. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=growth-management-in-preterm-infants#H2936310875\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Growth management in preterm infants&quot;, section on 'Bronchopulmonary dysplasia'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-milk-feeding-and-fortification-of-human-milk-for-premature-infants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human milk feeding and fortification of human milk for premature infants&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infant-benefits-of-breastfeeding\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infant benefits of breastfeeding&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neonatal-oral-feeding-difficulties-due-to-sucking-and-swallowing-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neonatal oral feeding difficulties due to sucking and swallowing disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">FLUID RESTRICTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based upon clinical experience, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) management restricts fluid intake to avoid pulmonary edema and improve pulmonary function. Although data based upon clinical trials comparing restrictive versus liberal intake are limited, there appears to be a trend towards better outcome with a more restrictive approach in the postnatal period in reducing the risk of BPD and decreasing mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. However, data are insufficient to show that fluid restriction is beneficial for infants with established BPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Adequate nutrition must be provided to ensure proper growth regardless of the decision to restrict fluid intake. As a result, caloric density of feeds may need to be increased in patients who are managed with a more restrictive fluid intake.</p><p>Most infants can be managed with modest fluid restriction of 140 to 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per day. Human milk with added fortifier or a commercial premature formula typically is used in preterm infants. Additional calories <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> protein may be added as needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-milk-feeding-and-fortification-of-human-milk-for-premature-infants#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human milk feeding and fortification of human milk for premature infants&quot;, section on 'Fortification of human milk'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=growth-management-in-preterm-infants#H2936310875\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Growth management in preterm infants&quot;, section on 'Bronchopulmonary dysplasia'</a>.)</p><p>In severely affected infants, fluid restriction to 110 to 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per day may be necessary. In this case, formula or human milk should be supplemented to 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">cal/oz</span> to include all major and trace nutrients. Consultation with a pediatric nutritionist is recommended to assist in preparation of these complex mixtures. Infants receiving restricted amounts of special formulas require supplemental iron and vitamins. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Nutrition'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DIURETICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although diuretic therapy has been shown to improve short-term pulmonary mechanics, there is little evidence that the long-term use of diuretics improves clinical outcome of infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The two classes of diuretic agents used in infants with BPD are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thiazide diuretics &ndash; Acute and chronic administration of diuretics that act on the distal renal tubule (thiazide <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spironolactone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">spironolactone</a>) produce short-term improvement in lung mechanics in preterm infants with BPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, in a systematic review, data were inadequate to show that distal diuretic administration improved long-term clinical outcome in infants with established or developing BPD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Further clinical trials are needed to determine whether there is a role for chronic use of thiazide diuretics.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loop diuretics &ndash; The loop diuretic most commonly used and best studied in the management of BPD is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">furosemide</a>. In a systematic review, chronic administration of furosemide either enterally or intravenously to infants with BPD older than three weeks of age improved pulmonary mechanics and oxygenation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Pulmonary mechanics were also improved after a single intravenous dose of furosemide (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg)</span>. However, no benefit was demonstrated in clinical outcomes, including need for ventilator support, length of hospital stay, survival, or long-term outcome. No consistent effects were found when intravenous furosemide was given to preterm infants younger than three weeks of age with developing BPD.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diuretic use causes urinary loss of sodium, potassium, and chloride, and often results in serum electrolyte abnormalities, especially hyponatremia and hypokalemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Hypochloremic alkalosis is a frequent complication. Dietary supplementation with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=potassium-chloride-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">potassium chloride</a> usually is needed to prevent these abnormalities. Little data are available regarding effect of diuretics on long-term bone growth and mineralization.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Furosemide</a> increases calcium excretion, sometimes leading to nephrocalcinosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> nephrolithiasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Furosemide is potentially ototoxic, especially with rapid intravenous administration. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Our approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Despite the lack of evidence for long-term benefit, we use diuretics in infants with BPD to improve pulmonary function in patients who remain ventilator-dependent or require positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) despite modest fluid restriction. Diuretic therapy also may reduce the need for severe fluid restriction and, thus, facilitate optimal nutrition, although this has not been studied.</p><p>The use of chronic diuretic therapy is considered for infants approximately three to four weeks of age who remain ventilator-dependent or require PEEP despite modest fluid restriction (140 to 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> per day). In these cases, we generally begin with a thiazide diuretic agent, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorothiazide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">chlorothiazide</a> (oral dose of 20 to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day divided into two doses). The published oral maximum dose is 375 mg; however, in our experience, we have never approached this maximum dose. In addition, intravenous administration of chlorothiazide can be given as a dose of 2 to 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day in two divided doses). Alternatively, we use hydrochlorthiazide (oral dose of 3 to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day divided into two doses [maximum dose of 37.7 mg per day]. We do not routinely use a combination of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spironolactone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">spironolactone</a> with chlorothiazide. In a small controlled trial, 33 infants were randomized to receive chlorothiazide alone or combination therapy with chlorothiazide plus spironolactone for two weeks. Intake of sodium and potassium was similar. Lung mechanics, serum electrolytes, and FiO<sub>2</sub> did not differ significantly between the two groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>In our practice, intermittent or single dosing of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">furosemide</a> (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per dose intravenously or 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per dose orally) is used to treat acute pulmonary exacerbation attributed to pulmonary edema. In infants with more severe respiratory decompensation, a trial of furosemide may be continued for two to three days. Furosemide is often given during or following packed red blood cell transfusion. We do <strong>not</strong> recommend combination therapy of furosemide and a thiazide diuretic. </p><p>We reserve a longer course of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">furosemide</a> for ventilator-dependent infants with severe BPD who had a short-term positive response to furosemide during an acute exacerbation, or as a trial in infants who remain unstable after modest fluid restriction and the administration of daily thiazide diuretics. The duration of furosemide therapy is dependent on the individual's response. However, we avoid the chronic use of furosemide, if possible, because of its potential complications of ototoxicity and nephrocalcinosis.</p><p>Serum electrolytes should be measured one to two days after initiating diuretic therapy, with an increase in diuretic dosing, and at least weekly with chronic use. Electrolyte supplements should be administered to compensate for increased urinary loss. We usually start with 2 to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/kg</span> per day of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=potassium-chloride-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">potassium chloride</a>, and adjust as needed.</p><p>We typically continue diuretic therapy until infants are no longer dependent on continuous PEEP and have a minimal supplemental oxygen requirement. Weaning strategies include decreasing the daily diuretic dose in a step-wise fashion every 3 to 4 days, or not adjusting the dose for growth. Serum electrolytes should be followed as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=potassium-chloride-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">potassium chloride</a> supplements are decreased.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">BRONCHODILATORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Inhaled or subcutaneous administration of beta-2 agonists (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albuterol-salbutamol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">albuterol</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levalbuterol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">levalbuterol</a>) acutely decreases airway resistance and increases compliance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/17,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,19,20</a>]. Changes in neonatal management (ie, use of surfactant, antenatal glucocorticoid therapy, and less aggressive mechanical ventilation), however, have reduced the risk of airway injury, resulting in fewer clinical episodes of reactive airway disease in young infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) and reduced use of beta-2 agonists during the early hospital course. These agents also have known adverse effects of tachycardia and hypertension, and possibly arrhythmias. As a result, we do <strong>not</strong> recommend <strong>routine or chronic</strong> use of inhaled B2 bronchodilators in infants with BPD because of lack of evidence of long-term efficacy and their known adverse effects.</p><p>In the one available trial that examined clinical outcomes, inhaled bronchodilators did not affect the course of BPD. In this study, 173 infants born at less than 31 weeks gestation and ventilator-dependent at 10 days of age were randomly assigned to receive treatment for 28 days in one of four groups: placebo and placebo, salbutamol and placebo, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=beclomethasone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">beclomethasone</a> and placebo, or salbutamol and beclomethasone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. There were no significant differences among the groups in regards to survival, developing and severity of BPD, or duration of ventilator support or oxygen therapy.</p><p>However, in some infants with severe BPD (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64789\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64789 \">table 1</a>), especially older infants who remain ventilator-dependent, acute episodes of bronchoconstriction can occur. In this setting, inhaled beta-2 agonists (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=albuterol-salbutamol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">albuterol</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=levalbuterol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">levalbuterol</a>) may improve short-term function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/20,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,22</a>]. An initial trial of beta-2 agonists is administered through a metered-dose inhaler with a spacer. The infant should be observed for clinical benefit, as evidenced by improved gas exchange (improved SpO<sub>2</sub> values <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> decrease in PaCO<sub>2</sub>), decreased respiratory effort, or fewer episodes of respiratory decompensation. If beneficial, the beta-2 agents can be used up to a 48-hour period, then progressively weaned. If no benefit is seen, treatment should be discontinued. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Acute exacerbations'</a> below.)</p><p>Bronchomalacia with large airway collapse is also seen in infants with BPD, although the reported incidence varies widely [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. It is important to differentiate these episodes of acute airway collapse from inflammatory airway edema or true reactive airways, because use of bronchodilators may worsen the airway stability of bronchomalacia.

Episodes of bronchoconstriction may be manifested by wheezing or decrease air movement. Rhonchi or decreased breath sounds are suggestive of a consolidated process, such as pneumonia. Rales may indicate pulmonary edema. Absent breath sounds may be due to pneumothorax, or displaced endotracheal tube in ventilator-dependent infants. Evaluation should also include assessing for prolonged expiratory phase and increased work of breathing during both inspiration and expiration.

The following discussion is based upon our approach to managing infants with BPD, and includes the care and monitoring that is provided during hospitalization and after discharge.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H116889800\"><span class=\"h2\">In-hospital care</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H116889602\"><span class=\"h3\">Growth</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients should be weighed two to three times per week while in the hospital, and length and head circumference should be measured weekly (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F70389\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef70389 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F90267\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90267 \">figure 2</a>).

In ventilator-dependent infants, acceptable PaCO<sub>2</sub> levels are between 55 and 65 mmHg as long as the pH is in the normal range (ie, 7.3 to 7.4); higher values (up to 70 mmHg) are occasionally tolerated depending on the extent of ventilator support, although the long-term effects of this strategy are uncertain. We initially obtain daily or every other day blood gas samples to monitor PaCO<sub>2</sub> and pH. Frequency of sampling decreases as the clinical condition stabilizes with few ventilator changes. Blood gas sample and chest radiograph are obtained to evaluate any episode of respiratory decompensation.

It is important to try to minimize the adverse impact of prolonged hospitalization upon infant development. An appropriate environment that minimizes noise, discomfort, and exposure to bright light should be identified for each patient. Primary nursing should be encouraged to allow the infant to be cared for by a small group of individuals. The clinical team should work closely with parents to promote infant-parent bonding, and provide a friendly, play-oriented environment using the infant's own toys and possessions.</p><p>Prior to discharge, parents and other potential caregivers should learn cardiopulmonary resuscitation.</p><p>The transition from hospital to home may require substantial preparation.
