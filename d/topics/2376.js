The bursae are fluid-filled sacs around joints and tendons, which decrease friction from movement and provide a cushion between bones, tendons, muscles, and skin.</p><p>Bursitis can be rapid in onset (acute) or build up slowly over time (chronic). Acute bursitis is often the result of an injury, infection, or inflammatory condition. Chronic bursitis often follows a long period of repetitive use or motion. Bursitis can involve almost any joint in the body, although some areas are more commonly affected than others.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">BURSITIS CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Causes of bursitis include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Injury, such as from a fall or hit</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infection resulting from bacteria entering the body through a cut or scrape in the skin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gout or other crystal diseases</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Certain types of arthritis, like rheumatoid arthritis or psoriatic arthritis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prolonged pressure, which can result from kneeling, sitting, or leaning on a particular joint for a long period</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Strain or overuse from repeating the same motion many times</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Joint stress from an abnormal gait; for example, walking unevenly because one leg is shorter than the other</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">BURSITIS SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Common symptoms of bursitis include pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> swelling at the affected site. Visible swelling is more common in superficial bursae that are closer to the surface of the skin, such as those around the elbows, kneecaps, and heels. Swelling is less commonly a feature of bursitis that affects structures, such as the bursae of the shoulders, hips, and inner knees.</p><p>In acute bursitis, there is often pain directly over the affected bursa; active motion (when the patient moves or bends the joint) also causes pain if the motion stretches the affected bursa. People with chronic bursitis are more likely to have swelling of superficial bursae, but pain varies in intensity. These patients may have limited range of motion because pain from the bursitis restricts motion of the nearby joint and surrounding muscles.</p><p>Bursitis caused by an infection is called &quot;septic bursitis.&quot; Symptoms may include pain, swelling, warmth, and redness around the affected joint. Fever may also be present. This is a potentially serious condition since infection can spread to nearby joints, bone, or the blood. Bursitis caused by gout is not infection-related but can mimic septic bursitis in the intensity of inflammation.</p><p>Specific symptoms of bursitis vary depending on the area that is affected. (See <a href=\"#H261587221\" class=\"local\">'Types of bursitis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H174077937\"><span class=\"h1\">BURSITIS DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnosing bursitis involves a physical examination, a review of your symptoms, and sometimes tests.</p><p>If infection or crystal disease (for example, gout) is suspected, your doctor may use a syringe and needle to remove a sample of fluid from the affected bursa. This is called &quot;aspiration.&quot; The fluid can then be examined under a microscope for crystals, bacteria, and white blood cells.</p><p>Imaging (such as X-ray, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], or ultrasound) is not usually needed to diagnose bursitis. However, it can help in some situations, such as when other problems need to be ruled out (for example, a tear in the cartilage or ligament). It can also be useful if your doctor needs to remove fluid from a bursa near other areas that could be injured, such as nerves or blood vessels. Imaging can allow the doctor to visualize where the needle is going.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H261587221\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF BURSITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bursitis can affect many different areas of the body. The exact symptoms and preferred treatments depend on the location as well as the cause.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H261587276\"><span class=\"h2\">Shoulder (subacromial bursitis)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Shoulder bursitis causes pain in the shoulder and often extends to the upper arm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F60661\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60661 \">figure 1</a>). Pain is often present at rest but increases with movement of the arm, especially with lifting the arms above the head; it also often interrupts sleep. It can be difficult to differentiate shoulder bursitis from other issues such as a rotator cuff tear or tendinitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H261587282\"><span class=\"h2\">Upper back (scapulothoracic bursitis)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Upper back bursitis affects the space between the scapula (shoulder blade) and ribs and can cause pain or a popping sensation. Reaching the arms overhead or doing pushups can make pain worse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H261587288\"><span class=\"h2\">Elbow (olecranon bursitis)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Elbow bursitis usually causes a visible swelling at the tip of the elbow, like a golf ball. It can result from injury (bleeding into the bursa), infection, crystals (gout), or rheumatoid arthritis. It usually causes pain when the elbow is flexed, but not extended. The elbow often extends fully without discomfort.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H261587294\"><span class=\"h2\">Pelvis (ischial bursitis)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pelvic bursitis has also been referred to as &quot;weaver's bottom&quot; or &quot;tailor's bottom&quot; since it is often caused by prolonged sitting on hard surfaces. It causes pain in the lower buttocks that is aggravated by sitting (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F65477\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65477 \">figure 2</a>); pain may disappear when the person stands.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H261587300\"><span class=\"h2\">Hip</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H533313249\"><span class=\"h3\">Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (formerly called trochanteric bursitis)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The greater trochanteric bursa is located in the upper outer part of the femur (thigh bone) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F65477\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65477 \">figure 2</a>). Bursitis in this area is usually associated with inflammation of nearby tendons and can cause pain while lying or sleeping on the affected side of the body. People with greater trochanteric pain syndrome also tend to have pain when extending the leg to walk, but not while standing still. Symptoms can be aggravated by an abnormal gait, due to uneven stress on the hips. There are many contributing factors, including chronic back pain, contralateral knee pain (knee pain on the opposite side of the body from the bursitis), different leg lengths, and being overweight.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H533313261\"><span class=\"h3\">Iliopsoas bursitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The psoas muscle runs from the spine to the femur and is used to flex the hip. The iliopsoas bursa abuts the psoas muscle deep in the front of the hip. This type of bursitis causes pain in the groin area, particularly when the hip is flexed against resistance or when climbing stairs. It can result from arthritis in the area, overuse (for example, excessive running), or injury. Because symptoms are similar to those of other hip problems (for example, problems with the bone or cartilage), imaging tests are often required to confirm the diagnosis. Infection in the psoas muscle (psoas abscess) can have similar symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H261587306\"><span class=\"h2\">Knee</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H533313274\"><span class=\"h3\">Prepatellar and infrapatellar bursitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prepatellar bursa is located in front of the patella (kneecap) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F59257\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59257 \">figure 3</a>); the infrapatellar bursa is below this. Bursitis in these areas can result from recurrent injury to the knee and is often seen in people who frequently kneel. Prepatellar bursitis has been referred to as &quot;housemaid's knee&quot; or &quot;nun's knee.&quot; It can also happen as a result of infection, gout, or rheumatoid arthritis. Swelling occurs within the bursa, not in the knee joint itself. People with prepatellar and infrapatellar bursitis usually feel more comfortable lying down with the knee extended, while people with swelling within the true knee joint tend to feel better lying down with the knee partially bent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H533313281\"><span class=\"h3\">MCL bursitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The medial collateral ligament (MCL) is located on the inner side of the knee, and connects the femur (thigh bone) to the tibia (shin bone) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F77293\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77293 \">figure 4</a>). Bursitis in this area can cause pain and tenderness, but doesn't usually involve swelling. It must be differentiated from an injury or tear to the MCL or meniscus (the cartilage in the knee).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H533313288\"><span class=\"h3\">Pes anserinus pain syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The anserine bursa is located about two inches below the top of the tibia (shin bone), on the inner side of the knee. Pes anserinus pain syndrome (formerly referred to as anserine bursitis) causes pain on the inner side of the knee, which tends to come on abruptly, often during the night. It is more common in people with osteoarthritis of the knee, obesity, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> with genu valgum (when the knees point inward, also called knock-knee deformity).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H261587312\"><span class=\"h2\">Heel (retrocalcaneal bursitis)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The retrocalcaneal bursa is between the heel bone and the Achilles tendon, which connects the heel to the calf muscle. It normally serves as a cushion to absorb impact when walking. Retrocalcaneal bursitis can cause pain and swelling in the area. It can be easily confused with Achilles tendinitis (inflammation of the Achilles tendon).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">BURSITIS TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bursitis treatment focuses on relieving inflammation and pain, treating infection (if present), and preventing complications and future recurrence.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H174077944\"><span class=\"h2\">Medication</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In most cases, nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can help relieve pain and inflammation. NSAIDs include ibuprofen (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin) and naproxen (sample brand name: Aleve); other NSAIDs, as well as higher doses, are also available by prescription. Topical NSAIDs (for example, diclofenac gel) may be an appropriate option for patients who cannot tolerate oral NSAIDs. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A glucocorticoid (steroid) injection can also help with pain and inflammation from bursitis. Steroid injection is indicated for some types of bursitis but not others. This is more often used when the affected area is deep under the skin (see <a href=\"#H261587276\" class=\"local\">'Shoulder (subacromial bursitis)'</a> above and <a href=\"#H533313249\" class=\"local\">'Greater trochanteric pain syndrome (formerly called trochanteric bursitis)'</a> above and <a href=\"#H533313281\" class=\"local\">'MCL bursitis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H533313288\" class=\"local\">'Pes anserinus pain syndrome'</a> above). It is not usually helpful (and can even be harmful) for more superficial types of bursitis, for example, in the olecranon bursa of the elbow, prepatellar bursa of the knee, or retrocalcaneal bursa of the heel.</p><p>Septic bursitis requires drainage of the infected fluid and antibiotics to treat the underlying infection (see <a href=\"#H174077958\" class=\"local\">'Treating infection'</a> below). Rarely, surgery is indicated in cases where drainage and antibiotics cannot cure the infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H174077951\"><span class=\"h2\">Protecting the joints</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is important to protect the affected joints in order to rest the affected area and help the bursae to heal. Bursal protection can also prevent the bursitis from getting worse or recurring. Examples of joint protection include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoiding or modifying activities that cause pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of pads or cushions for people who have to kneel or sit frequently</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Modifying footwear to reduce pressure on the back of the heel (eg, cutting a &quot;V&quot;-shaped groove into the back of a shoe; using a pad inside the shoe to lift the heel)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Custom-fitted devices worn over the elbows to protect them and prevent fluid from building up again</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H174078085\"><span class=\"h2\">Other measures</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ice can help relieve pain, particularly for bursitis affecting superficial areas like the elbow, kneecap, and heel. Heat (eg, a heating pad) may be more effective for deeper forms of bursitis, such as the hip, shoulder, or inner knee.</p><p>In many cases, physical therapy can help treat symptoms of bursitis and prevent future recurrence. The optimal exercises depend on the type and severity of bursitis, but may involve stretching, strengthening, or working to improve (and maintain) range of motion.</p><p>Rarely, surgery is required to remove all or part of the affected bursa.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H174077958\"><span class=\"h2\">Treating infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Septic bursitis is treated with antibiotics. The choice of which antibiotic to use, and for how long, is based on the type and severity of infection. For mild cases, a few weeks of oral antibiotics may be enough; for more severe infection, intravenous (IV) antibiotics (given in the hospital) may be required.</p><p>It is also often necessary to drain infected fluid using a needle. This is done in a doctor's office, usually several times, until the infection has resolved.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your healthcare provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your medical problem.</p><p>This article will be updated as needed on our web site (<a href=\"http://www.uptodate.com/patients&amp;token=nygaOTnDuGxGrKiuwLIxjMIsa91xyzRx3QvmgfDh4FTTVfpiGy3XGWFyzaLmJXXU&amp;TOPIC_ID=9171\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.uptodate.com/patients</a>).
