Determining the location of the pregnancy is the first priority in the evaluation of these women, with the exception of hemodynamic stability. Whether the pregnancy is intrauterine or ectopic (and the precise extrauterine location) guides the remainder of the evaluation and management. Early diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy is important to avoid adverse sequelae of this potentially life-threatening condition. Pelvic ultrasonography is the most useful imaging modality for these patients.</p><p>Sonography of women with pregnancy of unknown location will be reviewed here. General principles of the diagnosis and management of ectopic pregnancy and of obstetric ultrasound are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ectopic-pregnancy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ectopic pregnancy: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ultrasound-examination-in-obstetrics-and-gynecology\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ultrasound examination in obstetrics and gynecology&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-assessment-of-gestational-age-date-of-delivery-and-fetal-weight\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prenatal assessment of gestational age, date of delivery, and fetal weight&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ULTRASOUND VERSUS OTHER IMAGING MODALITIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultrasonography (US) is the <span class=\"nowrap\">pelvic/abdominal</span> imaging modality of choice for pregnant women. It does not require the use of potentially harmful ionizing radiation, is readily available, and allows real-time imaging. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-imaging-procedures-during-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic imaging procedures during pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Magnetic resonance imaging is useful if US is not able to elucidate the location of a pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasonography-of-pregnancy-of-unknown-location/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Examples of this include differentiating an intrauterine pregnancy (IUP) from a cervical or interstitial pregnancy or elucidating the anatomic relationships of an abdominal pregnancy.</p><p>Computed tomography generally has no role in the evaluation of pregnancy of unknown location, due both to its limited resolution of tissue planes and use of radiation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ULTRASOUND TECHNIQUE</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Transabdominal versus transvaginal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) is the principle approach used for sonographic evaluation of pregnancy of unknown location. TVUS allows for earlier and more reliable detection of an intrauterine or ectopic pregnancy (abdominal pregnancies are an exception) and for more reliable detection of a fetal heartbeat compared with transabdominal ultrasound (TAUS) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F56290\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef56290 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F65128\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef65128 \">image 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasonography-of-pregnancy-of-unknown-location/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. For the remainder of this review, the term US refers to TVUS if not otherwise specified.</p><p>TAUS is useful as an initial study since it allows for a larger field of view than transvaginal scanning. We start with a TAUS to get a general overview of the pelvic anatomy and also scan the upper abdomen. A low frequency transducer (typically 2 to 5 MHz) is used, which allows penetration through the anterior soft tissues. Imaging of the upper abdomen is used primarily to check for free fluid.</p><p>The next step is a TVUS, performed with a higher frequency transducer (typically 5 to 12 MHz). Since the area of interest is closer to the probe, less penetration is needed.</p><p>Principles of ultrasound transducers and probes are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ultrasound-examination-in-obstetrics-and-gynecology#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ultrasound examination in obstetrics and gynecology&quot;, section on 'Transducers'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Doppler ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doppler color flow ultrasound is of limited value in the diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy. Trophoblastic tissue has high velocity systolic flow and low impedance diastolic flow, characteristics that are highlighted with Doppler. However, the absence of a finding of color flow Doppler in a complex adnexal mass does not exclude an ectopic pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasonography-of-pregnancy-of-unknown-location/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In addition, color flow Doppler does not differentiate a tubal pregnancy from a corpus luteum, since a &quot;ring of fire&quot; appearance can be seen for either entity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F68980\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef68980 \">image 3</a>)&nbsp;(see <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Fallopian tubes'</a> below).</p><p>The primary contribution of Doppler in women with pregnancy of unknown location is that it occasionally identifies an adnexal mass that was not detected on grey scale US (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F57420\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef57420 \">image 4</a>). In addition, Doppler ultrasound may aid in determining placental patterns of blood flow at ectopic sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasonography-of-pregnancy-of-unknown-location/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Three-dimensional ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Three-dimensional US is typically not needed for diagnosis of ectopic pregnancy. However, it may be useful if the precise location of a pregnancy is unclear, such as in interstitial pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasonography-of-pregnancy-of-unknown-location/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">ABSENCE OF FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When a pregnant patient with pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bleeding has an US, particularly a TAUS, that has no findings (ie, no IUP, adnexal mass, or echogenic fluid), the differential diagnosis is normal early IUP, nonviable IUP, or ectopic pregnancy. Approximately 15 to 26 percent of women with ectopic pregnancy will have a &quot;normal&quot; initial US [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasonography-of-pregnancy-of-unknown-location/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>].</p><p>In a hemodynamically stable patient, an US with no findings should be repeated when the human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) reaches the discriminatory zone for endometrial findings or in three to four days, since the gestational sac of an IUP grows approximately 1 mm per day and is visible on US when it reaches 3 mm or greater. In 11 to 16 percent of cases with an indeterminate initial scan, ectopic pregnancy is evident on follow-up US [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasonography-of-pregnancy-of-unknown-location/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">hCG discriminatory zone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diagnosis of pregnancy is made by measuring the serum or urine hCG. The hCG is often positive before US can detect a pregnancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-early-pregnancy#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of early pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Detection of hCG'</a>.)</p><p>The discriminatory zone for hCG is the serum level above which a gestational sac should be visualized by ultrasound examination if an IUP is present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasonography-of-pregnancy-of-unknown-location/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. While many pregnancies can be visualized at relatively low hCG levels (&lt;2000 <span class=\"nowrap\">mIU/mL),</span> setting a threshold for visualization of a definitive IUP is problematic. As an example, one study found a 99 percent predicted probability of visualization of a gestational sac was at an hCG level of 3510 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/L</span>.</p><p>However, if an IUP is not seen in a patient with positive hCG and the patient is stable and has a desired pregnancy, hCG testing and US should be repeated within 48 hours. Since factors such as the margin of error of hCG measurement, multiple gestation, or recent pregnancy may elevate the hCG, and the quality of US is variable, there is no established maximum hCG at which a patient with no IUP on US should be treated for ectopic pregnancy without further evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasonography-of-pregnancy-of-unknown-location/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. As an example, in a retrospective series of 51 women with an hCG greater than 2000 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/L</span> and no IUP on US, 15 were treated for ectopic pregnancy and 35 were managed expectantly. Of those who were managed expectantly, all had an IUP at follow-up US (viable IUP: 16; spontaneous abortion: 19) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasonography-of-pregnancy-of-unknown-location/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p>The typical pattern of hCG concentration in early pregnancy is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ectopic-pregnancy-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ectopic pregnancy: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">EARLY ENDOMETRIAL FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During the first three to five weeks of pregnancy (conceptus phase), the endometrium has a &quot;trilaminar&quot; appearance. The first sonographic finding of either a normal or abnormal pregnancy is an endometrial fluid collection. As a pregnancy progresses, a yolk sac and embryo should eventually be visualized, which confirm the location of the pregnancy (see <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Endometrial findings diagnostic of intrauterine pregnancy'</a> below).</p><p>Sonographic measurement of endometrial thickness has also been studied as a diagnostic test for ectopic pregnancy, but most investigators have not found it to be clinically useful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasonography-of-pregnancy-of-unknown-location/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>].</p><p>Many women develop pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bleeding during early gestation, thus, it is important to identify characteristics of endometrial fluid collections associated with either IUP or ectopic pregnancy. Depending upon patient symptoms and hemodynamic status, management decisions often must be based upon this early information.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Intrauterine pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Findings consistent with a gestational sac are suggestive, but not diagnostic, of an IUP.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Gestational sac</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The gestational sac of an early pregnancy may be distinguished from other intrauterine fluid collections (including an endometrial pseudosac) by the presence of the intradecidual sign and the double decidual sign. However, these signs were defined with use of transabdominal ultrasound. With transvaginal ultrasound, the intradecidual sign or double decidual sign are absent in at least 35 percent of gestational sacs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasonography-of-pregnancy-of-unknown-location/abstract/14,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,19</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Pseudosac'</a> below and <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Decidual cyst'</a> below.)</p><p>The presence of a gestational sac without a yolk sac <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> embryo at specific sac size thresholds is diagnostic of a missed abortion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F77246\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef77246 \">image 5</a>).

It is eccentrically located within the endometrial cavity and should deviate the endometrial lining. This structure and its echogenic rim represent the chorionic cavity, implanting chorionic villi, and associated decidual tissue. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-assessment-of-gestational-age-date-of-delivery-and-fetal-weight#H2581016212\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prenatal assessment of gestational age, date of delivery, and fetal weight&quot;, section on 'Gestational sac'</a>.)</p><p>Detection of the intradecidual sign in a woman with first trimester bleeding <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pain is only partially reassuring, since its sensitivity for detecting an IUP is 48 to 68 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasonography-of-pregnancy-of-unknown-location/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. Further evaluation is needed to ensure an IUP and appropriate growth of the pregnancy.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Double decidual sac sign &ndash; The double decidual sign is visible at 4 to 6 weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasonography-of-pregnancy-of-unknown-location/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>] until up to 9 weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasonography-of-pregnancy-of-unknown-location/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. It is most helpful prior to 6 to 6.5 weeks of gestation, as an embryo is typically seen after that time. It consists of two concentric echogenic rings of tissue surrounding an intrauterine gestational sac (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F56970\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef56970 \">image 7</a>). This sign is mostly useful for identifying an IUP using TAUS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasonography-of-pregnancy-of-unknown-location/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. When the double decidual sac sign is seen on TAUS, a yolk sac can typically already be seen using TVUS.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Ectopic pregnancy</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Pseudosac</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A pseudosac can be seen in up to 20 percent of women with an ectopic pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasonography-of-pregnancy-of-unknown-location/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

The presence of a yolk sac within the gestational sac is diagnostic of an IUP, but does not confirm viability. On TVUS, the yolk sac is typically seen by approximately 5.5 weeks of gestation and should always be visible before the embryo is visible (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F65128\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef65128 \">image 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasonography-of-pregnancy-of-unknown-location/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>Thus, when a yolk sac is not seen and an embryo is identified, an abnormal intrauterine pregnancy is present.

An embryo is typically seen at approximately 6 to 6.5 weeks of gestation. A commonly used discriminatory criterion for visualization of an embryo on TVUS is a mean gestational sac diameter of 25 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasonography-of-pregnancy-of-unknown-location/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. It should be noted that an embryo is typically seen in sacs smaller than 25 mm. The 25 mm threshold is used in order to ensure that a normal pregnancy is not missed.</p><p>Embryonic cardiac activity is generally detected by the time the embryonic crown-rump length is 2 to 3 mm in size; if the crown-rump length is 7 mm or greater in size, without cardiac activity, it is a non-viable pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasonography-of-pregnancy-of-unknown-location/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. As with gestational sac size, the 7 mm threshold is set high to avoid missing a normal pregnancy. Since cardiac activity is typically seen prior to this size, it is not a reassuring findings to see, for example, a 5 mm embryo without cardiac activity. Therefore counseling of these patients should include the concern for a nonviable pregnancy, but the desire to give the pregnancy every chance to continue as long as this is safe for the patient, and thus a follow-up ultrasound is typically performed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">ADNEXAL FINDINGS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An extraovarian adnexal mass, seen in 89 to 100 percent of women with ectopic pregnancy, is the most common US finding in tubal pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasonography-of-pregnancy-of-unknown-location/abstract/11,26,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,26,30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Ovaries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a woman with a pregnancy of unknown location, US of the ovaries is performed to differentiate the normal corpus luteum of pregnancy from a tubal or ovarian pregnancy. This distinction is simple when the corpus luteum has a thin, almost imperceptible wall and is clearly located within the ovary. However, when the corpus luteum is hemorrhagic with a thick wall or is exophytic, it can mimic the appearance of an ectopic pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasonography-of-pregnancy-of-unknown-location/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p>In challenging cases, the degree of echogenicity of an adnexal mass may help distinguish the tubal ring of an ectopic pregnancy from a corpus luteum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F72660\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef72660 \">image 10</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasonography-of-pregnancy-of-unknown-location/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].

To perform this technique, one hand is on the TVUS probe and the other hand applies gentle suprapubic pressure to move the uterus and adnexa.

A meta-analysis of 565 women in 10 studies reported that using a sonographic finding of an adnexal mass other than a simple cyst or an intraovarian lesion for the diagnosis of a tubal pregnancy had a sensitivity of 84 percent and specificity of 99 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasonography-of-pregnancy-of-unknown-location/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>Since some types of adnexal masses are long standing, an US with a nonspecific adnexal mass may be compared with prior studies to assess whether the mass was visualized previously and whether it has changed in appearance. In a woman without evidence of an IUP, any type of new adnexal mass should be further evaluated until the location and status of the pregnancy have been confirmed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h1\">PERITONEAL FREE FLUID</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Echogenic peritoneal free fluid in a woman with a pregnancy of unknown location is associated with ectopic pregnancy.</p><p>A small amount of clear free fluid in the pelvis is a normal sonographic finding. There is no established threshold for the volume of fluid that is physiologic and the volume is difficult to measure sonographically. However, fluid that is anechoic and isolated to the pelvic cul-de-sac and adjacent recesses is likely physiologic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasonography-of-pregnancy-of-unknown-location/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Larger quantities of simple fluid are typically reflective of pathology, even if due to a ruptured simple ovarian cyst.</p><p>Echogenic or complex fluid is never physiologic, even when present in small quantities, and almost always represents hemoperitoneum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F61836\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef61836 \">image 15</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasonography-of-pregnancy-of-unknown-location/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Alternatively, echogenic fluid may also be purulent. For example, patients with ruptured appendicitis with secondary abscess formation or tuboovarian abscess, can have focal, &quot;walled-off&quot; areas of echogenic complex fluid. This fluid appears more contained (rather than free intraperitoneal, as in the case of hemoperitoneum) and the clinical presentations of these patients are different from those with positive pregnancy test presenting for assessment for ectopic pregnancy. When echogenic fluid is seen in the pelvis, it is important to scan the upper abdomen around the liver, kidneys, and spleen, to assess for additional fluid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F81382\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef81382 \">image 16</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-tubo-ovarian-abscess\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of tubo-ovarian abscess&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-appendicitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-differential-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute appendicitis in adults: Clinical manifestations and differential diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Echogenic fluid in a pregnant woman with no evidence of an IUP is worrisome for ectopic pregnancy. In a prospective study, the finding of echogenic fluid in pregnant women with a pregnancy of unknown location had a sensitivity of 56 percent and specificity of 96 percent for predicting an ectopic pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasonography-of-pregnancy-of-unknown-location/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The main differential diagnosis for this finding is a ruptured hemorrhagic corpus luteal cyst. The presence of an adnexal mass with characteristics consistent with an ectopic gestation helps to clarify the diagnosis (see <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Fallopian tubes'</a> above).</p><p>The presence or absence of peritoneal free fluid is not a reliable indicator of whether an ectopic pregnancy has ruptured [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasonography-of-pregnancy-of-unknown-location/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. This was illustrated in a retrospective study of 132 women with tubal pregnancy who underwent TVUS prior to surgery. Among women found to have tubal rupture at time of surgery, 21 percent had no fluid or trace peritoneal fluid on US. On the other hand, 37 percent of patients with large amounts of free fluid (defined as fluid present in the upper abdomen) on US had intact fallopian tubes at time of surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasonography-of-pregnancy-of-unknown-location/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>Severe bleeding from either an ectopic pregnancy or a ruptured corpus luteal cyst requires immediate evaluation and treatment. If there is a large volume of echogenic fluid (&gt;300 mL), the patient should be assessed for ongoing bleeding and hemodynamic instability. An unstable patient needs immediate surgical intervention. If the patient is hemodynamically stable, follow-up with serial hCG <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> US may be performed until the evaluation for ectopic pregnancy is complete.

Interstitial pregnancies may be misdiagnosed as intrauterine because they are partially implanted in the endometrium and also may be discovered at an advanced gestational age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasonography-of-pregnancy-of-unknown-location/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>].

This refers to a pregnancy that extends beyond the interstitium into the lateral &quot;angle&quot; of the uterine cavity. This distinction is important since angular pregnancies, unlike interstitial pregnancies, are more likely to miscarry than rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasonography-of-pregnancy-of-unknown-location/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Ovarian pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The sonographic diagnosis of an ovarian pregnancy is difficult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasonography-of-pregnancy-of-unknown-location/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. An ovarian ectopic pregnancy can be mistaken for a corpus luteum, unless the gestational sac of an embryo is visualized surrounded by ovarian tissue. Laparoscopy and pathologic analysis are often necessary to make the diagnosis. Ovarian pregnancies can be confused for hemorrhagic cysts even at laparoscopy. Pathologic criteria developed by Spiegelberg to distinguish primary ovarian pregnancies from other ectopic pregnancies with secondary involvement of the ovary are as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/ultrasonography-of-pregnancy-of-unknown-location/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(1) The fallopian tube on the involved side is intact and separate from the ovary.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(2) The gestational sac is in the normal position of the ovary.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(3) The ovary with the gestational sac is connected to the uterus by the ovarian ligament.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(4) The specimen has ovarian tissue attached to, and in, the wall of the gestation sac.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h2\">Heterotopic pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women who undergo in vitro fertilization (IVF) are at increased risk of heterotopic pregnancy compared with other pregnant women. The risk of multiple gestations in women who undergo IVF is such that if an intrauterine pregnancy is seen in a woman with pain and bleeding who has undergone IVF, her risk of ectopic (approximately 1 percent) is the same as a woman who has not had IVF without an intrauterine pregnancy who has pain and bleeding. Thus, even when US identifies an IUP in an IVF pregnancy, it is important to carefully survey potential ectopic gestation sites (eg, tube, ovary, cervix).</p><p>Sonographic signs suggestive of heterotopic pregnancy are the same as for any ectopic pregnancies (eg, complex adnexal mass, peritoneal free fluid).</p><p>The diagnosis and management of heterotopic pregnancy are discussed in detail separately.
