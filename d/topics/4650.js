The cryopyrinopathies are rare, with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 360,000 in a French study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryopyrin-associated-periodic-syndromes-and-related-disorders/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. A related but distinct autoinflammatory disorder is due to deficiency of the IL-1 receptor antagonist (DIRA).</p><p>There are a number of other periodic autoinflammatory disorders that often present with periodic fever. These disorders are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=periodic-fever-syndromes-and-other-autoinflammatory-diseases-an-overview\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Periodic fever syndromes and other autoinflammatory diseases: An overview&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CRYOPYRIN-ASSOCIATED PERIODIC SYNDROMES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All three cryopyrinopathies arise from mutations in a single gene, <em>NLRP3</em>, at chromosome 1q44, encoding a protein called cryopyrin (also known as NALP3 [nacht domain-, leucine-rich repeat- and pyrin domain-containing protein 3] or PYPAF1 [pyrin domain-containing apoptotic protease activating factor 1-like protein]; cryopyrin is derived from the Greek words for icy cold and fire) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryopyrin-associated-periodic-syndromes-and-related-disorders/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. The mode of inheritance is autosomal dominant with variable penetrance.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cryopyrin is important in innate immunity as part of the multiprotein NALP3 inflammasome complex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryopyrin-associated-periodic-syndromes-and-related-disorders/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. It belongs to a family of NLR (nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat-containing) proteins that respond to intracellular pathogens and other danger signals.</p><p>Cryopyrin serves as a scaffold for assembly of the inflammasome complex. This complex is responsible, through a cascade of interactions involving caspase 1, for activation of the potent proinflammatory cytokines interleukin-1-beta (IL-1-beta) and interleukin-18 (IL-18) by cleavage of their inactive precursors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryopyrin-associated-periodic-syndromes-and-related-disorders/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>]. In addition to its intracellular function, the NALP3 inflammasome can be released from activated macrophages, where it can amplify inflammation by continuing to activate IL-1-beta in the extracellular milieu and in neighboring phagocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryopyrin-associated-periodic-syndromes-and-related-disorders/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p>Signals for cryopyrin activation include the various PAMPs (pathogen-associated molecular patterns, such as muramyl dipeptides, bacterial or viral ribonucleic acid [RNA]), DAMPs (danger-associated molecular patterns, such as uric acid crystals, adenosine triphosphate [ATP], low intracellular concentrations of potassium, skin irritants, ultraviolet B radiation), and possibly alum, the commonly used vaccine adjuvant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryopyrin-associated-periodic-syndromes-and-related-disorders/abstract/5,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,9</a>].</p><p>Point mutations in <em>NLRP3</em> in the cryopyrinopathies are thought to promote aberrant formation of the inflammasome and inappropriate production of active IL-1-beta, either due to defective self-inhibition by the mutant cryopyrin protein or to resistance of the established inflammasome to negative regulatory signals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryopyrin-associated-periodic-syndromes-and-related-disorders/abstract/10-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-13</a>]. Murine studies suggest that aberrant production of IL-18 and caspase-1-driven pyroptosis plays roles in these diseases, although the efficacy of IL-1 antagonists in patients with CAPS suggests that excess IL-1-beta retains a primary pathogenic role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryopyrin-associated-periodic-syndromes-and-related-disorders/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of cryopyrinopathies'</a> below.)</p><p>Phenotypic differences among the CAPS probably reflect in large part the differential impact of mutations on the activity of the inflammasome, modulated by individual genetic background. Not surprisingly, the boundaries between these three syndromes are not sharp, and patients may have features of more than one disorder or may not be classic for any of them [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryopyrin-associated-periodic-syndromes-and-related-disorders/abstract/11,15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,15-17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H374439414\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical features of specific disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical features of the three types of CAPS are reviewed below.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS), formerly called familial cold urticaria, is the mildest of the cryopyrin-associated disorders.

(See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MWS is a rare condition characterized by the triad of intermittent episodes of fever, headache, urticarial rash, and joint pain (arthralgias or arthritis); progressive sensorineural hearing loss; and secondary amyloidosis with nephropathy. Febrile episodes occur at irregular intervals every few weeks, lasting 12 to 36 hours before resolving spontaneously. Age of onset is variable. Precipitating factors vary and cannot always be identified, but they may include both heat and cold. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Muckle-Wells syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abnormalities in cryopyrin are responsible for NOMID, which is also known as CINCA syndrome. Clinical features, including a migratory, erythematous rash resembling urticaria, fever, impaired growth, abnormal facies with frontal bossing, protruding eyes, and saddle-shaped nose, are characteristic and generally develop at or near the time of birth. Other manifestations affecting the brain, eyes, joints, liver, and spleen may also be present, and AA amyloidosis can occur. NOMID may cause premature death. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A central role for IL-1-beta in these disorders is confirmed by the effectiveness of therapies directed against IL-1 in preventing and alleviating symptoms and in substantially reducing levels of inflammatory indices, including serum amyloid A. These therapies include anakinra, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rilonacept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rilonacept</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=canakinumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">canakinumab</a>. Anakinra may be superior to the other agents for central nervous system (CNS) inflammation. Vaccination against pneumococcus should be pursued with caution because of the potential for increased CAPS-associated inflammatory response. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of cryopyrinopathies'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Anakinra'</a> above and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Rilonacept (IL-1 trap)'</a> above and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Canakinumab'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An autoinflammatory syndrome distinct from the cryopyrinopathies is characterized by the neonatal onset of sterile multifocal osteomyelitis, periostitis, a neutrophilic dermatosis, and elevated acute-phase reactants without fever. Untreated patients may die from multiorgan failure. The patients have a deficiency of the IL-1-receptor antagonist (IL-1RN) due to homozygous germline mutations, which may result in hyperresponsiveness to IL-1-beta stimulation and the clinical syndrome. The most effective treatment has been with the IL-1 receptor antagonist, anakinra. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Deficiency of the IL-1-receptor antagonist (DIRA)'</a> above and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Genetics'</a> above and <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cryopyrin-associated-periodic-syndromes-and-related-disorders/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Cuisset L, Jeru I, Dumont B, et al.
