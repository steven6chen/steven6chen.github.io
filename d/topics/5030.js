It encompasses abnormal development of the acetabulum and proximal femur and mechanical instability of the hip joint (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F88588\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef88588 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Newborns often have physiologic laxity of the hip and immaturity of the acetabulum during the first few weeks of life. In most cases, the laxity resolves, and the acetabulum proceeds to develop normally. With assessment of risk factors, serial physical examination of the hips, and appropriate use of imaging studies, most children with pathologic hips can be correctly diagnosed and treated without long-term sequelae. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-treatment-and-outcome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Developmental dysplasia of the hip: Treatment and outcome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Typical DDH, which generally occurs in otherwise healthy infants, will be the focus of this topic review. Hip dysplasia and instability also occur in association with other conditions. Teratologic hip dysplasia occurs in association with various syndromes (eg, Ehlers-Danlos, Down syndrome, arthrogryposis), and neuromuscular hip dysplasia occurs when there is weakness <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> spasticity in some or all of the hip muscle groups (eg, in spina bifida or cerebral palsy). The diagnosis and management of teratologic and neuromuscular hip dysplasia differ from the diagnosis and management of hip dysplasia in otherwise healthy infants.</p><p>The clinical features and diagnosis of DDH in otherwise healthy children will be reviewed here. The epidemiology, pathogenesis, treatment, and outcome are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Developmental dysplasia of the hip: Epidemiology and pathogenesis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-treatment-and-outcome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Developmental dysplasia of the hip: Treatment and outcome&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical features of DDH depend upon the age of the child and the severity of the abnormality (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77015\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77015 \">table 2</a>). The spectrum of presentation ranges from instability on the newborn examination, to subtle limited abduction in the infant, to asymmetric gait in the toddler, to activity-related pain in the adolescent, to osteoarthritis in the adult. The earlier DDH is detected, the simpler and more effective the treatment and the better the long-term outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].

The most important risk factors are female sex, breech positioning at &ge;34 weeks gestation (whether or not external cephalic version is successful) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], family history of DDH, and tight lower extremity swaddling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Conditions that are associated with DDH, but are not proven to increase the risk of occurrence, include torticollis, plagiocephaly, metatarsus adductus, clubfoot, being the firstborn infant, oligohydramnios, birthweight &gt;4 kg, and multiple gestation pregnancy.

The Barlow maneuver, the Galeazzi test (also called the Allis or Perkins test), and the Klisic test also may be useful. Decreased abduction generally is not present at this age. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Hip instability'</a> below and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Asymmetry'</a> below and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Klisic test'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After three months of age, limited abduction, apparent thigh-length discrepancy (in unilateral cases), and the Galeazzi (for unilateral cases) and Klisic tests are better indicators of DDH than instability. By three months of age, tests of instability are of little value because unstable hips have usually stabilized (the once-dislocatable hip stabilizes in the reduced position; the once-reducible hip stabilizes in the dislocated position). (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Range of motion'</a> below and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Asymmetry'</a> below and <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Klisic test'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In walking-aged children with unilateral DDH, weakness of the hip abductors on the affected side may be indicated by a positive Trendelenburg pelvic tilt test (inability to maintain the pelvis horizontally while standing on the ipsilateral leg) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F67453\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67453 \">figure 1</a>) and the presence of a Trendelenburg lurch while walking.

The infant should be on a stable surface in the supine position, with the hip flexed to 90&deg; and in neutral rotation. The examination should occur when the infant is calm and not crying. The hips are best examined with all clothing and diapers removed from the lower extremities.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ortolani maneuver</strong> &ndash; The thigh is grasped loosely with the examiner's index and middle finger along the greater trochanter and the thumb on the inner thigh. From an adducted position, the hip is gently abducted while lifting or pushing the trochanter anteriorly. Extreme abduction should be avoided because it decreases the sensitivity of the Ortolani maneuver. If the hip is dislocated, the Ortolani maneuver may reduce it and is accompanied by a palpable clunk. A positive Ortolani maneuver assumes a dislocated hip that is reducible.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Barlow maneuver</strong> &ndash; The hip is held in the same manner as for the Ortolani maneuver. The thigh is grasped loosely with the examiner's index and middle finger along the greater trochanter and the thumb on the inner thigh. The hip is <strong>gently</strong> adducted, without applying any downward pressure, while palpating for the head moving out of the back of the acetabulum. If the hip is <strong>dislocatable</strong>, posterior movement and a palpable clunk may be detected as the femoral head exits the acetabulum (the &quot;jerk of exit&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2,7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,7-9</a>]. A <strong>subluxatable</strong> hip is characterized by a subtle sliding movement or a feeling of looseness, like a tennis ball moving in a soup bowl. A positive Barlow maneuver assumes a reduced hip that is subluxatable or dislocatable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p>The sensation of reduction or dislocation is distinct and best described as a &quot;jerk&quot; or &quot;clunk.&quot; This sensation is different from that of the high pitch benign joint popping, clicking, or snapping caused by the snapping of tendons or ligaments in and around the hip and knee. The term &quot;hip click&quot; is misleading and is best avoided; hip clicks are not suggestive of DDH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>The combination of the Barlow and Ortolani maneuvers has a high specificity (estimated to be approximately 98 to 99 percent) in the detection of hip instability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The sensitivity varies depending upon the skill of the examiner, the number of examinations performed, and the diagnostic standard (eg, ultrasonography, plain radiographs). Sensitivity is increased in experienced hands (ranging from 87 to 97 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/13-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Asymmetry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Asymmetric examination findings may be helpful in unilateral DDH. However, as many as 37 percent of cases are bilateral [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Lack of asymmetry does not exclude DDH and may delay the diagnosis.</p><p>Apparent shortening of one femur is an important sign of unilateral dislocation and can be elicited with the Galeazzi test. This is performed with the infant supine, hips flexed to 90&deg;, knees flexed, and feet flat on a level surface and side by side, with the heels in apposition to the buttocks. In this position, the knees are normally at the same level. In unilateral dislocation, the head of the femur is displaced posteriorly, functionally shortening the thigh, and the ipsilateral knee will be lower than the other knee (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F63965\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63965 \">figure 2</a>). A positive Galeazzi test is not specific for DDH. Other causes of leg-length discrepancy must be considered (eg, hemihypertrophy, femoral hypoplasia, coxa vara).</p><p>Asymmetry in the position or number of the inguinal, thigh, or gluteal skin folds may be a clue to the diagnosis of DDH (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F65835\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65835 \">figure 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F78543\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef78543 \">figure 4</a>). In the case of DDH, these increased folds are due to functional shortening of the femur with &quot;bunching&quot; of the skin and muscle around it. This finding is sensitive but not specific for DDH, since skin fold asymmetry is present in approximately 24 percent of all infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. This asymmetry is more likely to be seen in children with unilateral DDH.</p><p>In the child who is walking, gait asymmetry may provide a clue to unilateral DDH. The abnormal gait is usually caused by leg-length discrepancy, resulting in gait changes, such as toe-walking on the affected side or vaulting over the longer contralateral leg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. A child with unilateral hip dislocation will have a Trendelenburg lurch on the affected side (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F67453\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67453 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Range of motion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a child older than two to three months, limitation of abduction (&lt;45&deg;) is the most reliable sign of DDH. Normal range of motion in a supine infant with the pelvis stabilized is &gt;75&deg; for abduction and at least 30&deg; past the midline for adduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In a 10-year prospective longitudinal study that included 2876 infants, unilateral limited hip abduction after eight weeks of age had a sensitivity of 78 percent and specificity of 93 percent in the detection of radiographically confirmed DDH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In another review of 683 infants older than three months, unilateral limited hip abduction had a sensitivity of 69 percent and a specificity of 54 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Infants younger than two to three months may have normal adduction because they have not had enough time to develop an adduction contracture. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Developmental dysplasia of the hip: Epidemiology and pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'Embryology and pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with unilateral DDH may have increased internal rotation of the hip because increased femoral anteversion is often associated with DDH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Internal hip rotation is assessed with the patient lying prone on the examination table and the knees flexed; the lower leg is rotated away from the axis of the body (rotating the hip internally) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71765\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef71765 \">figure 5</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-child-with-in-toeing#H25515563\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the child with in-toeing&quot;, section on 'Focused examination of the lower extremities'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Klisic test</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A positive Klisic test is suggestive of DDH. The Klisic test is performed by placing the index finger on the anterior-superior iliac spine and the middle finger on the greater trochanter. An imaginary line between these points passes through or above the umbilicus in a child without DDH (negative Klisic test). The line passes below the umbilicus if the hip is dislocated (positive Klisic test) because the greater trochanter is in a more superior position (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F74071\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74071 \">figure 6</a>). The Klisic test may be particularly helpful in bilateral dislocations when abduction is symmetrical and the Galeazzi sign is negative (ie, the knees are at the same height), because the result is evaluated independently for each side and does not rely on comparison with the contralateral limb.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H101508168\"><span class=\"h3\">Bilateral dislocation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bilateral DDH occurs in as many as 37 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/18,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,25</a>]. In infants younger than three months, the tests for instability (ie, the Ortolani and Barlow maneuvers) may be useful in detecting bilateral DDH. However, as DDH progresses, dislocated hips become irreducible and instability is no longer detected. Findings related to symmetry (eg, Galeazzi sign, thigh folds) are not helpful in bilateral dislocation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Developmental dysplasia of the hip: Epidemiology and pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'Embryology and pathogenesis'</a>.)</p><p>In children older than three months, the most important examination finding for bilateral dislocated hips is symmetric limited abduction (&lt;45&deg;). Other signs may include widening of the perineum, bilateral positive Klisic tests, and short thigh segments relative to the child's size (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F86943\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef86943 \">figure 7</a>). Once the child begins to walk, hyperlordosis and a waddling Trendelenburg gait are classic findings (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77015\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77015 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F67453\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67453 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Dysplasia without dislocation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dysplasia without dislocation usually has no clinical findings and is asymptomatic until adolescence or early adulthood. It is often found only through diligent screening of risk factors or incidentally when radiographs are obtained for other concerns (eg, an abdominal radiograph for evaluation of bowel obstruction, cystography (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F88828\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef88828 \">image 1</a>)) or for assessment of activity-related hip pain in an adolescent or young adult.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H119602133\"><span class=\"h2\">Natural history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The natural history of untreated DDH depends upon the age of the patient and the severity of DDH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/26-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-29</a>]. Most hip instability in newborns stabilizes soon after birth, as physiologic laxity decreases and the femoral head and acetabulum grow. In observational studies, there is a high rate of resolution of neonatal hip instability without intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/4,7,30-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7,30-33</a>]. In a cohort of 11,989 infants examined by a single examiner, 60 percent of hips that demonstrated instability on physical examination at birth stabilized in the first week of life, and nearly 90 percent stabilized by two months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. These hips were functionally and radiographically normal at 12 months of age. Similar results were reported in a study of routine ultrasonographic screening of more than 14,000 infants: 6 percent had abnormalities soon after birth, 90 percent of which became normal by nine weeks of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>Infants and young children with untreated hip dislocation rarely show signs of pain or other limitations. Most children reach developmental milestones at the appropriate time. A dislocated hip generally does not delay the age at which the child begins to walk. A dislocated hip may function well for many years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. However, weakness in the hip abductor musculature may result in the classic Trendelenburg gait pattern. Over time, there may be gradual progression of functional disability, pain, and accelerated degenerative hip disease. The risk of these complications is not well-defined but may be associated with the development of a false acetabulum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Patients with unilateral dislocations may have leg-length discrepancy, ipsilateral knee problems, scoliosis, and gait disturbance. Patients with bilateral dislocations may develop back pain (perhaps related to increased lumbar lordosis).</p><p>Dysplasia in a reduced or subluxed hip may be diagnosed incidentally when radiographs are obtained for other reasons. The clinical course for patients with this presentation is variable. These hips are often asymptomatic in infants and young children, and radiographic abnormalities may improve with time, as the acetabulum still has excellent remodeling potential [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/34-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-37</a>]. After school age, the likelihood of spontaneous improvement is low. Patients with persistent dysplasia without dislocation may remain asymptomatic for some time but may develop activity-related hip pain or premature degenerative joint disease in adolescence or young adulthood. This occurs as a result of increased cartilage contact stress at the anterior and lateral margins of the acetabulum. Pain may start soon after skeletal maturity, or, in females, during the first or second pregnancy, or at menopause. Patients 40 to 60 years old who present with hip osteoarthritis are often found to have mild dysplasia as a contributing cause [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/26-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-29</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Ultrasonography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultrasonography is the primary imaging technique for assessing the morphology and stability of the infant hip.

Ultrasonography can be helpful in confirming physical examination findings and evaluating infants with risk factors who have normal examination findings. The major drawback of ultrasonography is that accurate interpretation requires training and experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>Ultrasonographic criteria for DDH have been established for static imaging (which includes coronal and transverse planes) and dynamic imaging of the flexed hip with and without a modified Barlow stress maneuver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/40,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,42</a>]. The combination of static and dynamic imaging permits evaluation of hip morphology, position, and stability.</p><p>Static views include a coronal image with the infant in the lateral decubitus position and the hips flexed at 30 to 45&deg; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. In this position, the ossified ilium is viewed as a straight white line above the femoral head and superior acetabulum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F80478\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80478 \">figure 8</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F56328\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef56328 \">image 2</a>). In practice, these images are often oriented as if the baby is lying in the lateral position, with the ilium pointed to the left of the femoral head, instead of above it. The alpha angle is measured from the lateral wall of the ilium and the bony roof line. The beta angle is the angle formed by the lateral wall of the ilium and the cartilaginous roof line. These angles are used to classify DDH according to the Graf system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F56551\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56551 \">figure 9</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Another important parameter is the percentage of the femoral epiphysis that is covered by the acetabular roof. For infants younger than four months of age, we generally consider coverage of &gt;50 percent to be normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>].</p><p>The dynamic technique uses axial and coronal images with real-time stress of the femoral head, similar to the instability test maneuvers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. In the first few days of life, 4 to 6 mm of laxity is considered normal. Dynamic imaging is usually omitted when the hips are examined during treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Plain radiographs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plain radiographs may be helpful in the evaluation of DDH after four to six months of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/38,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,40</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-epidemiology-and-pathogenesis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Developmental dysplasia of the hip: Epidemiology and pathogenesis&quot;, section on 'Terminology'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hip examination should occur soon after birth and at every health supervision visit until approximately nine months of age <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the child is walking independently. The symptoms and signs of DDH vary with age and severity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77015\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77015 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above and <a href=\"#H119602789\" class=\"local\">'Age-specific findings of DDH'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physical examination techniques to detect hip instability use abduction and elevation to feel for reducibility (the Ortolani maneuver) and gentle adduction to feel for dislocatability (the Barlow maneuver). The sensation of reducibility or dislocatability is distinct and best described as a &quot;jerk&quot; or &quot;clunk.&quot; Examination findings that are less specific for DDH include asymmetry (of femur length, skin folds, or gait) and decreased hip abduction. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Hip instability'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Asymmetry'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Range of motion'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnostic imaging is helpful in confirming physical examination findings, evaluating infants with risk factors, and making treatment decisions. During the first four months of life, ultrasonography is the primary imaging technique for assessing the morphology and stability of the hip. Ultrasonographic measurements (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F80478\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80478 \">figure 8</a>) are used to classify DDH according to the Graf system (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F56551\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56551 \">figure 9</a>). (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Ultrasonography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of DDH in infants is usually made by physical examination demonstrating hip instability, asymmetry (in unilateral cases), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> limited abduction. Absence of asymmetry does not exclude DDH because DDH is bilateral in as many as 37 percent of cases. Examination findings of DDH vary according to age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F77015\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77015 \">table 2</a>). Diagnostic imaging can be used to make the diagnosis in infants with inconclusive examination findings. Diagnostic imaging also may be used to make the diagnosis in infants who have risk factors and normal examination. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Our approach to diagnosis of and referral for DDH varies with the examination findings, age of the infant, and risk factors for DDH:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For infants with a positive Ortolani maneuver or limited or asymmetric abduction, we suggest referral to an orthopedic surgeon who is experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of DDH. (See <a href=\"#H3958734177\" class=\"local\">'Positive Ortolani or limited/asymmetric abduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For infants with a positive Barlow maneuver, we suggest serial follow-up examinations by the primary care clinician or an orthopedic surgeon who is experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of DDH to ensure development of hip stability. (See <a href=\"#H2162888590\" class=\"local\">'Positive Barlow'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For newborns with suboptimal or inconclusive examination, we suggest re-examination at the next health supervision visit. For infants two to four weeks of age with inconclusive examination, we suggest referral to an orthopedic surgeon who is experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of DDH. For infants older than four weeks with inconclusive examination, we suggest imaging. (See <a href=\"#H209229796\" class=\"local\">'Suboptimal or inconclusive examination'</a> above and <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic imaging'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>We obtain ultrasonography at four to six weeks (adjusted for prematurity) of age for infants with normal examination and any of the following risk factors (see <a href=\"#H3956277790\" class=\"local\">'Normal examination and risk factors'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Breech positioning at &ge;34 weeks gestation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Family history of DDH (including hip replacement for dysplasia before age 40 years in a close relative)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>History of clinical instability on examination</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/developmental-dysplasia-of-the-hip-clinical-features-and-diagnosis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Weinstein SL, Mubarak SJ, Wenger DR.
