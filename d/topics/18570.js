However, the efficacy of vasodilator therapy has <strong>not</strong> been established in asymptomatic AR as a means of mitigating changes in LV size and function and delaying the onset of symptoms and thus the need for corrective surgery.</p><p>The role of vasodilator therapy in chronic severe AR in adults will be reviewed here. Issues related to the pathophysiology, clinical features, and course and management of chronic AR and to acute AR are discussed separately.

There is no evidence of benefit in patients with mild to moderate AR.</p><p>On physical examination, severe AR is characterized by a longer diastolic murmur, a displaced LV impulse, a wide pulse pressure, and the peripheral findings of a wide pulse pressure such as a water hammer (Corrigan's) pulse and other signs such as a head bob occurring with each heart beat (de Musset's sign). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-chronic-aortic-regurgitation-in-adults#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of chronic aortic regurgitation in adults&quot;, section on 'Physical examination'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=examination-of-the-arterial-pulse#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Examination of the arterial pulse&quot;, section on 'Water hammer pulse'</a>.)</p><p>However, the accuracy of physical examination is not reliable and a hemodynamic definition, usually by echocardiography, is the recommended method for determining the severity of AR. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-aortic-valve#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Echocardiographic evaluation of the aortic valve&quot;, section on 'Aortic regurgitation'</a>.)</p><p>For clinical purposes, the importance of defining severe chronic AR in asymptomatic patients is to identify those who might be candidates for more frequent monitoring. Almost all patients with chronic severe AR have or will develop LV dilation. Only severe AR is likely to produce LV dilation. Thus, one should look for other causes, such as a cardiomyopathy, when LV dilation is present in patients with mild to moderate AR.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">DETERMINANTS OF REGURGITANT VOLUME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The regurgitant volume in aortic regurgitation is determined by two factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasodilator-therapy-in-severe-chronic-aortic-regurgitation-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The magnitude and duration of the diastolic pressure gradient across the valve. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The effective regurgitant orifice area. It has been assumed that the regurgitant orifice area is constant, but this notion may not be valid in patients with disease of the aortic root.</p><p/><p>In contrast, the LV ejection fraction, systemic vascular resistance, systolic blood pressure, and ventricular afterload are <strong>not</strong> direct determinants of the regurgitant volume.</p><p>The duration of diastole is primarily a function of heart rate; as a result, bradycardia will increase AR flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasodilator-therapy-in-severe-chronic-aortic-regurgitation-in-adults/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Although pacing-induced tachycardia offers little benefit to patients with chronic AR, clinicians should be aware of the potential danger of bradycardia.</p><p>The other major determinant of regurgitant volume is the transvalvular pressure gradient throughout diastole.

After 12 months, nifedipine (20 mg twice daily), reduced the systolic pressure and LV volume, and increased the ejection fraction. The only change in the placebo group was a small decrease in the ejection fraction.

Once a patient is on maximal ACE inhibitor therapy, we would add other antihypertensive drugs only for a diastolic pressure over 90 mmHg, which would be rare in severe AR, and possibly for a systolic pressure over 160 mmHg. However, a high systolic pressure is common in severe AR and is often difficult to reduce.</p><p>If further antihypertensive drug therapy is given, we suggest avoiding beta blockers. By slowing the heart rate, beta blockers prolong diastole, thereby increasing the diastolic regurgitant time and the regurgitant volume per beat.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3270030200\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Conservative therapy includes periodic monitoring for progressive disease that would fulfill criteria for surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=natural-history-and-management-of-chronic-aortic-regurgitation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Natural history and management of chronic aortic regurgitation in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Randomized trials have produced conflicting findings as to whether there is or is not a benefit from vasodilator therapy. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical trials and studies'</a> above.)</p><p>Recognizing the limitations of the data, we treat as follows. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Therapeutic decisions'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest long-term vasodilator therapy in asymptomatic patients with hypertension and any degree of AR (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). This includes the systolic hypertension associated with severe chronic AR, which can increase wall stress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasodilator-therapy-in-severe-chronic-aortic-regurgitation-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, it is often difficult to lower the blood pressure with vasodilators in patients with severe AR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/vasodilator-therapy-in-severe-chronic-aortic-regurgitation-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend <strong>against</strong> long-term vasodilator therapy in patients who are not at risk for progression including those with mild to moderate AR and those with what appears to be severe AR without LV enlargement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F54569\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54569 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;(<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>).

Nifedipine is an acceptable alternative to an ACE inhibitor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether or not vasodilators are used, it is imperative to follow the patient closely in order to detect the earliest symptoms or exercise intolerance, and to perform serial studies of LV size and function.
