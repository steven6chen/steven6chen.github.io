It is also the primary dietary source for two n-3 (also called omega-3) long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA): eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). EPA is a precursor of DHA and metabolized to DHA in the liver.</p><p>Maternal n-3 PUFA intake is necessary for optimal visual and cognitive development in offspring, and may also have other benefits when taken in pregnancy. However, fish consumption also exposes women to methylmercury and other environmental contaminants, toxins that cannot be completely avoided when fish are consumed. The beneficial effects of DHA and other nutrients in fish may outweigh the potential harmful effects of small amounts of methylmercury, especially when fish low in mercury and high in DHA are consumed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-consumption-and-docosahexaenoic-acid-dha-supplementation-in-pregnancy/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>DHA and EPA are also available as supplements and in fortified foods. These products are an alternative source of n-3 PUFA for women who cannot or choose not to consume fish, but may not have identical effects.</p><p>This topic will discuss potential obstetrical and <span class=\"nowrap\">fetal/infant</span> benefits and risks of maternal consumption of fish and DHA supplements during pregnancy. Issues related to the health effects of fish and these supplements in the general population are reviewed separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fish-oil-and-marine-omega-3-fatty-acids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fish oil and marine omega-3 fatty acids&quot;</a>). n-3 PUFA supplementation for breast- and formula-fed infants is also reviewed separately.

Although infants can convert shorter-chain n-3 fatty acids to DHA to a greater extent than adults, it is not known whether such conversion is adequate for the developing brain in the absence of adequate maternal DHA intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-consumption-and-docosahexaenoic-acid-dha-supplementation-in-pregnancy/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>].</p><p>In most prospective cohort and retrospective studies, higher maternal prenatal fish consumption has been associated with improved neurodevelopment in offspring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-consumption-and-docosahexaenoic-acid-dha-supplementation-in-pregnancy/abstract/1,2,8-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,8-16</a>]. However, fish consumption is the primary source of non-occupational maternal methylmercury exposure. It is present in all fish tissues, cannot be cooked out of the fish, and over 95 percent is absorbed. (See <a href=\"#H2278055282\" class=\"local\">'Mercury levels in fish'</a> below.)</p><p>Exposure to methylmercury in fetal life can cause diffuse and widespread neurologic damage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-consumption-and-docosahexaenoic-acid-dha-supplementation-in-pregnancy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In fact, the fetal brain is considered the tissue most sensitive to the harms of mercury. The particular sensitivity of the fetus to toxic effects from organic mercury exposure was revealed as a result of episodes of community-wide mercury poisoning in Japan (Minamata disease) and Iraq [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-consumption-and-docosahexaenoic-acid-dha-supplementation-in-pregnancy/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Pregnant women exposed to methylmercury in these communities developed no or minimal symptoms themselves, but their children had delayed attainment of developmental milestones and, in some cases, devastating neurologic handicaps, including blindness, deafness, and cerebral palsy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mercury-toxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mercury toxicity&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-occupational-and-environmental-risks-to-reproduction-in-females\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of occupational and environmental risks to reproduction in females&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the 1970s and 1980s, longitudinal prospective studies were initiated in island populations to evaluate the effects of more modest methylmercury exposure from habitual fish consumption during pregnancy. Results from cohorts in New Zealand and the Faroe Islands suggested that higher prenatal methylmercury exposure from high seafood consumption was associated with decrements in attention, language, verbal memory, motor speed, and visuospatial function in offspring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-consumption-and-docosahexaenoic-acid-dha-supplementation-in-pregnancy/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>]. These findings prompted recommendations for pregnant women to limit fish consumption. However, a similar cohort study in the Seychelles Islands (Seychelles Child Development Study) found no harmful effect of prenatal methylmercury exposure through age 19 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-consumption-and-docosahexaenoic-acid-dha-supplementation-in-pregnancy/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>], while another study of a smaller Seychelles cohort observed an inverse association between mercury levels in maternal hair and Psychomotor Developmental Index score at 30 months in offspring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-consumption-and-docosahexaenoic-acid-dha-supplementation-in-pregnancy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>None of these studies initially included an estimate of the overall effect of maternal prenatal fish consumption on child development. When investigators from the Faroe Islands subsequently reanalyzed their data to better estimate the independent effects of fish intake and mercury exposure, they found that maternal fish intake was associated with improvements in motor and spatial function in children at age 14 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-consumption-and-docosahexaenoic-acid-dha-supplementation-in-pregnancy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Additionally, in the Seychelles cohort, as prenatal methylmercury exposure increased, the investigators observed improved performance on four of 27 developmental endpoints at age 17 years, including a reduction in behavioral problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-consumption-and-docosahexaenoic-acid-dha-supplementation-in-pregnancy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This unexpected result may be because nutrients in fish with positive neurodevelopmental effects had a dominant impact; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selenium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">selenium</a>, which is also present in fish, has protective effects that counteracted the toxic effects of mercury; other unknown factors; or chance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-consumption-and-docosahexaenoic-acid-dha-supplementation-in-pregnancy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Subsequent publications from cohorts with lower mercury exposures have not shown harmful associations of prenatal mercury exposure with infant development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-consumption-and-docosahexaenoic-acid-dha-supplementation-in-pregnancy/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>], cognition at 6 to 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-consumption-and-docosahexaenoic-acid-dha-supplementation-in-pregnancy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], or behavior through 11 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-consumption-and-docosahexaenoic-acid-dha-supplementation-in-pregnancy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>] and several studies have reported that higher maternal prenatal fish consumption is associated with improved neurodevelopment in offspring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-consumption-and-docosahexaenoic-acid-dha-supplementation-in-pregnancy/abstract/1,2,8-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,8-14</a>].</p><p>The benefits of fish consumption in observational studies are limited by multiple factors. Available studies have relatively high rates of drop-out and loss to follow-up, as well as difficulties in accurately measuring the type and quantity of fish consumed. Confounding is a key issue as seafood intake may be a marker of a healthy lifestyle or socioeconomic status. Fish consumption may replace consumption of foods that are harmful and fish may have beneficial nutrients other than long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFA). Thus, it is possible that high fish consumption is only an indirect marker of other factors associated with a good neurodevelopmental outcome.</p><p>It should also be noted that fish, especially fatty fish tissues, may also be contaminated with persistent organic pollutants, including polychlorinated biphenyls, brominated flame retardants, and dioxins. Exposure to these contaminants has been declining steadily since the 1970s, when government regulations in the United States and elsewhere reduced (but did not eliminate) industrial emissions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-consumption-and-docosahexaenoic-acid-dha-supplementation-in-pregnancy/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. More than 90 percent of exposure to persistent organic pollutants occurs from exposure to foods other than fish [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-consumption-and-docosahexaenoic-acid-dha-supplementation-in-pregnancy/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Evidence for adverse health effects associated with persistent organic pollutant exposure during pregnancy has been inconsistent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-consumption-and-docosahexaenoic-acid-dha-supplementation-in-pregnancy/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-occupational-and-environmental-risks-to-reproduction-in-females\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of occupational and environmental risks to reproduction in females&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H732437716\"><span class=\"h2\">Potential effects on preterm birth, birth weight, and growth</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The effect of fish consumption on other pregnancy outcomes has not been studied extensively. A prospective cohort study including over 2000 pregnant women reported fish intake was not associated with length of gestation or risk of preterm birth after adjustment for maternal and child factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-consumption-and-docosahexaenoic-acid-dha-supplementation-in-pregnancy/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>], while another reported that moderate fish intake (up to three meals per week) before 22 weeks of gestation was associated with a reduction in repeat preterm birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-consumption-and-docosahexaenoic-acid-dha-supplementation-in-pregnancy/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>], but these data are subject to the same limitations of observational studies described above.</p><p>A single randomized trial has been performed. The Cardiovascular Risk Reduction Diet in Pregnancy (CARRDIP) trial reported a diet low in saturated fat and cholesterol and enriched with polyunsaturated fatty acids (ie, fish, low-fat meats and dairy products, oils, whole grains, fruits, vegetables, legumes) markedly reduced the rate of preterm birth in low-risk pregnancies compared with controls consuming their usual diet (preterm birth <span class=\"nowrap\">1/141</span> versus <span class=\"nowrap\">11/149;</span> mean gestational age at delivery 281 versus 277 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-consumption-and-docosahexaenoic-acid-dha-supplementation-in-pregnancy/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. However, this trial did not distinguish between the effects of fish consumption versus other dietary changes.</p><p>In pooled cohort studies, moderate and high fish intake has also been associated with small increases in birth weight and infant growth rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-consumption-and-docosahexaenoic-acid-dha-supplementation-in-pregnancy/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2278055282\"><span class=\"h2\">Mercury levels in fish</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some mercury exposure is inevitable if fish are consumed. It is not possible to completely eliminate this risk without eliminating fish consumption. Reference levels for mercury in commercial fish and shellfish are available from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), although estimates may be based on as few as three fish samples (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F63441\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63441 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-consumption-and-docosahexaenoic-acid-dha-supplementation-in-pregnancy/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The most comprehensive information on mercury levels in commercial fish in the United States is available in a database maintained by <a href=\"http://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/gelfond/fish/database.html&amp;token=ZafDavVKtHW17Kphi3M4JasxDBPcRlFbxdpSS0Gy1Vapp99p6/X0eWcqXEaDRorK3na4HkZtMpfBvqV5KLlrGg==&amp;TOPIC_ID=431\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">Stony Brook University</a>, based on a much larger foundation of data aggregated from government monitoring programs and the scientific literature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-consumption-and-docosahexaenoic-acid-dha-supplementation-in-pregnancy/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>Local advisories should be checked about the safety of fish caught by individuals in local lakes, rivers, and coastal areas.</p><p>A limitation of all of these estimates is the variability in the mercury content of fish of the same species. For example, the mean concentration of mercury in canned light tuna is 0.128 ppm <span class=\"nowrap\">(mcg/g),</span> with a range from 0 to 0.889 ppm. Thus, a 60 kg woman consuming 4 oz of canned light tuna per week would on average get 0.03 mcg <span class=\"nowrap\">mercury/kg</span> body weight per week (30 percent of the reference dose) but could get none (0 percent of the reference dose) or could get as much as 0.25 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg/week</span> (250 percent of the reference dose).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1831408102\"><span class=\"h2\">Safe level of mercury intake</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) reference dose of methylmercury is 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> body <span class=\"nowrap\">weight/day</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-consumption-and-docosahexaenoic-acid-dha-supplementation-in-pregnancy/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. The reference dose is an estimate (with uncertainty spanning about an order of magnitude) of a daily exposure to the human population (including sensitive subgroups) that is likely to be without an appreciable risk of deleterious effects during a lifetime.</p><p>Other regulatory agencies have made different recommendations regarding intake limits for methylmercury, and these limits are two- to threefold higher than that of the Environmental Protection Agency. The United States Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry derived a Minimal Risk Level of 0.3 mcg <span class=\"nowrap\">methylmercury/kg</span> body <span class=\"nowrap\">weight/day</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-consumption-and-docosahexaenoic-acid-dha-supplementation-in-pregnancy/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]; the World Health Organization's Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives and Contaminants derived a Provisional Tolerable Intake of 0.23 mcg <span class=\"nowrap\">/kg/day</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-consumption-and-docosahexaenoic-acid-dha-supplementation-in-pregnancy/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]; and the Canadian Bureau of Chemical Safety recommended a Provisional Tolerable Intake of 0.20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg/day</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-consumption-and-docosahexaenoic-acid-dha-supplementation-in-pregnancy/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H567380857\"><span class=\"h2\">Advice on fish consumption</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For women who may become pregnant, are currently pregnant, or breastfeeding, the US FDA and EPA advise consumption of one to three weekly servings of a variety of types of seafood high in n-3 PUFA and low in mercury and other contaminants, while avoiding consumption of fish that is high in mercury (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F111607\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111607 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-consumption-and-docosahexaenoic-acid-dha-supplementation-in-pregnancy/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. Local advisories should be consulted about the safety of fish caught in local lakes, rivers, and coastal areas. If no advice is available, they suggest restricting intake of these fish to up to 6 oz (one average meal) per week and not consuming any other fish during that week.</p><p>There is evidence that fish consumption guidelines have not been effective in achieving a reduction in mercury exposure without adversely reducing fish or DHA intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-consumption-and-docosahexaenoic-acid-dha-supplementation-in-pregnancy/abstract/48-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-52</a>]. For example:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a time-series analysis among a cohort of pregnant women, some surveyed before dissemination of a 2001 national mercury advisory in the United States, and others surveyed afterwards, average total fish intake after publication of the advisory was lower by about 1.4 monthly servings, a 17 percent decline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-consumption-and-docosahexaenoic-acid-dha-supplementation-in-pregnancy/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Women surveyed after the advisory ate fewer fish servings, not only of the dark meat fish likely to have higher mercury contamination, but also of fish types not specifically named in the advisory and likely to be lower in mercury.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similarly, an analysis of data obtained from 15,000 United States households that scanned universal product codes on all purchased food products upon returning home from shopping found that at-risk consumers reduced fish intake in 2000 to 2002, resulting in declines in both mercury and n-3 intakes across the entire distribution, including those with already low intake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-consumption-and-docosahexaenoic-acid-dha-supplementation-in-pregnancy/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. Consumers did not differentially avoid high mercury fish, nor did they replace high mercury fish with low mercury, high omega-3 species.</p><p/><p>Given that there are both benefits and risks to fish consumption, it appears that a nuanced approach is necessary to ensure that advice from expert groups leads to desired behavioral changes and no undesired changes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-consumption-and-docosahexaenoic-acid-dha-supplementation-in-pregnancy/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2085880874\"><span class=\"h1\">LONG-CHAIN POLYUNSATURATED FATTY ACID CONSUMPTION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2621180336\"><span class=\"h2\">Preparations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Supplements containing either fish oil or DHA synthesized by algae are available in a variety of doses, and include formulations marketed for pregnant women. Products commonly available at major drug or health food stores contain the labeled amount of EPA and DHA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-consumption-and-docosahexaenoic-acid-dha-supplementation-in-pregnancy/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Different fish oil formulations contain variable amounts of EPA and DHA, with the remainder typically comprised of other n-3 PUFA, monounsaturated fats, saturated fats, and gelatin or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glycerin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">glycerin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-consumption-and-docosahexaenoic-acid-dha-supplementation-in-pregnancy/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>]. Thus, a 1 g capsule of fish oil may contain between 200 and 950 mg of EPA and DHA.</p><p>Additionally, a number of foods fortified with DHA are now available, including yogurt, milk, eggs, and cereals. However, many supplemented foods contain the plant-based n-3 PUFA (alpha-linolenic acid [ALA]), rather than marine n-3 PUFA, which cannot be considered a replacement for EPA+DHA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-consumption-and-docosahexaenoic-acid-dha-supplementation-in-pregnancy/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Potential neurodevelopmental effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) is important for normal development of the retina and brain, the diet of most pregnant women does not contain DHA at levels recommended by expert groups. For this reason, maternal supplementation during pregnancy and lactation had been proposed as a potential means of enhancing visual and cognitive function in offspring. However, a 2016 Evidence <span class=\"nowrap\">Report/Technology</span> Assessment by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality concluded that maternal long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (n-3 PUFA) supplementation had no consistent effect on various measures of neurologic development, cognitive development, or visual acuity in offspring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-consumption-and-docosahexaenoic-acid-dha-supplementation-in-pregnancy/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. This conclusion was largely based on low- to moderate-quality data from randomized trials of maternal n-3 PUFA supplementation versus no supplementation during pregnancy. Subsequently, a placebo-controlled randomized trial of prenatal DHA supplementation followed over 500 children to age seven years (the earliest age at which adult performance can be predicted) and reported no significant differences in language, academic ability, or executive functioning between groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-consumption-and-docosahexaenoic-acid-dha-supplementation-in-pregnancy/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Perceptual reasoning was slightly higher in the DHA supplementation group, but parent-reported behavioral problems were worse in this group.</p><p>Infant formula containing n-3 and n-6 PUFA became available in the United States in 2002. Several randomized trials attempted to determine whether use of these supplemented infant formulas was associated with improved outcomes compared with unsupplemented formulas. Systematic reviews and meta-analyses of these randomized trials did not find conclusive evidence of persistent beneficial effects of PUFA supplementation of formula milk on the physical, visual, and neurodevelopmental outcomes of term or preterm infants followed up to three years of age, but also did not find evidence of harm.

Doses included 400 mg DHA daily, 3.7 g fish oil daily (56 percent DHA and 28 percent eicosapentaenoic acid [EPA]), and salmon twice weekly (each portion contains 1.16 g DHA and 0.57 g EPA).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Subsequent to this analysis, a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized trial (n = 736 women) of third-trimester supplementation with n-3 PUFA (2.4 g daily, 55 percent EPA and 37 percent DHA) reported that the intervention resulted in a 7 percent absolute reduction in the risk of persistent wheeze or asthma in offspring followed to age three to five years (16.9 versus 23.7 percent, hazard ratio 0.69, 95% CI 0.49-0.97) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-consumption-and-docosahexaenoic-acid-dha-supplementation-in-pregnancy/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. The reduction was driven by the impact of maternal treatment in women with EPA and DHA blood levels in the lowest third at baseline or with a <em>FADS</em> genotype associated with low EPA and DHA blood levels (low baseline EPA+DHA: persistent wheeze or asthma in offspring 17.5 versus 34.1 percent, hazard ratio 0.46, 95% CI 0.25-0.83). The estimated EPA+DHA intake of these women was below 321 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> before the intervention. There was also a reduction in risk of lower respiratory tract infections, but no difference in rates of asthma exacerbations, eczema, or allergic sensitization between groups. The supplement was well-tolerated, pregnancy outcomes were similar for both groups, and no adverse effects were described in the report.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although high-dose maternal n-3 PUFA supplementation was effective for preventing asthma in offspring in this trial, it was not clear that offspring of women without very low blood levels of n-3 PUFA significantly benefit or whether benefits persist into the school-age years. Subsequent trials should address whether similar effects will be observed in other populations, whether the beneficial effects persist, and whether lower n-3 PUFA doses are effective (it would be essentially impossible to achieve a comparable n-3 PUFA dose from fish consumption as the dose was 20-fold higher than the average intake from fish consumption in the United States).

Since fish is the only food in which n-3 PUFA naturally occur in abundance, regular fish consumption is the only way for women to achieve adequate DHA intake without using a supplement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/fish-consumption-and-docosahexaenoic-acid-dha-supplementation-in-pregnancy/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p>The DHA and mercury content of fish vary independently, so several options are available that are both high in DHA and low in mercury.
