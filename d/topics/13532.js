However, patients frequently experience a partial response to treatment. A number of augmentation strategies have been studied.</p><p>Pharmacotherapy for OCD in adults is discussed here.

A meta-analysis of 17 randomized trials with a total of 3097 patients with OCD found SSRIs to be more effective than placebo in reducing the symptoms of OCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. No individual SSRI was found to be more efficacious than the other SSRIs for OCD.

A tricyclic antidepressant, clomipramine inhibits the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine. Clomipramine is generally less well tolerated than the SSRIs or SNRIs. (See <a href=\"#H540846978\" class=\"local\">'Side effects'</a> below.)</p><p>Head-to-head comparisons between <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomipramine</a> and several of the SSRIs (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoxetine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluvoxamine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluvoxamine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paroxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paroxetine</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sertraline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sertraline</a>) have not shown either to be superior for OCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-adults/abstract/3-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-9</a>]. Some meta-analyses of randomized trials that did not directly compare clomipramine to SSRIs have suggested that clomipramine has a greater effect size than the SSRIs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. However, the studies of SSRIs generally occurred in an era later than the clomipramine trials, and thus likely included more patients who had previously responded inadequately to another agent.</p><p>In general, SSRIs and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomipramine</a> lead to improvement in 40 to 60 percent of people with OCD. On average, OCD patients who receive an adequate trial of one of these agents will experience a 20 to 40 percent reduction in their OCD symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-adults/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. Thus, they typically offer amelioration rather than elimination of symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H540845838\"><span class=\"h3\">Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based on their mechanism and similarity to the SSRIs, we would expect the serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) to effectively treat OCD. There has been limited study of these medications in OCD, however, and they have not been approved by the US FDA for OCD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-adults/abstract/13-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-18</a>]. As an example, there is only one small, eight-week trial that randomly assigned 30 patients with OCD to either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venlafaxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">venlafaxine</a> or placebo found no significant difference in OCD symptom reduction between the two groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. The maximum dose of venlafaxine was limited to 225 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>. Two additional randomized trials, which lacked a placebo control, compared higher doses of venlafaxine to SSRIs or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomipramine</a>, finding similar rates of response among the agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-adults/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Larger, placebo-controlled trials are needed. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=duloxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Duloxetine</a> has not been studied in OCD in randomized trials. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H540846978\"><span class=\"h2\">Side effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Common side effects of serotonergic antidepressants are described briefly below and in more detail separately.

There is much greater support from randomized trials for SSRIs than for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venlafaxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">venlafaxine</a>; the SSRIs have a superior side effect profile compared to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomipramine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Because none of the individual SSRIs have shown an advantage in efficacy for OCD, the choice among the SSRIs can be made on the basis of prior treatment response, drug side effects and their acceptability to the patient, and the potential for drug interactions. (See <a href=\"#H12522756\" class=\"local\">'Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors'</a> above and <a href=\"#H540845838\" class=\"local\">'Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors'</a> above and <a href=\"#H594864477\" class=\"local\">'Clomipramine'</a> above and <a href=\"#H540846978\" class=\"local\">'Side effects'</a> above.)</p><p>A beneficial aspect of the serotonergic antidepressants for OCD is that these medications can provide effective treatment for several depressive and anxiety disorders that commonly co-occur with OCD (See <a href=\"#H88195853\" class=\"local\">'Comparing pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy'</a> below.)</p><p>If an adequate trial of the SSRI results in no response, the patient should be given another trial of monotherapy, either with a different SSRI, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomipramine</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=venlafaxine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">venlafaxine</a>.</p><p>It has been estimated that less than half of patients will benefit from switching from one SSRI to another, and the likelihood of response diminishes as the number of failed adequate trials increases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p>If a trial of one of the serotonergic antidepressants results in a partial response, but the patient continues to experience clinically significant symptoms, we suggest augmentation of this agent.

A meta-analysis that supported this dose-response relationship also found that higher doses are associated with a higher proportion of dropouts due to side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

The dose can be increased every week or every other week (as tolerated). The patient should be maintained at a dose within the therapeutic range for at least 6 weeks before concluding that he or she is resistant to the agent; the treatment response curve appears to follow a logarithmic shape, with the greatest incremental benefits occurring on average by week 6 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. An adequate trial of medication for OCD has thus been defined as the maximum dose tolerated for a minimum of 6 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. It is important to explain this to patients, so that they do not prematurely stop the medication before it has a chance to work. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selective-serotonin-reuptake-inhibitors-pharmacology-administration-and-side-effects\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors: Pharmacology, administration, and side effects&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Evidence is limited on the efficacy of higher-than-recommended dosing of SSRIs for OCD (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluoxetine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluoxetine</a> 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span>. A trial randomly assigned patients with OCD who had not responded to 16 weeks of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sertraline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sertraline</a> (titrated from 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> to continue sertraline at 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> or to continue at an increased dose (averaging 357 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. After 12 weeks of treatment, the higher dose group showed greater average improvement than the lower dose group. However, the difference was clinically modest. Both groups continued to have clinically significant symptoms and similar rates of adverse events. Thus, increasing SSRIs to higher than recommended doses may be effective for certain OCD patients, but this is not a highly effective strategy for all and can lead to more side effects. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88195202\"><span class=\"h3\">Duration of treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although clinical trials of current medications for OCD are mostly short-term, extended trials of SSRIs and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clomipramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clomipramine</a>, which randomly assigned drug responders to continued medication treatment or to placebo, have generally found that patients who continue medication have a lower rate of relapse than patients on placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-adults/abstract/21,29-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,29-32</a>]. Relapse rates have varied widely, in part due to methodological differences among studies. As a result, American Psychiatric Association practice guidelines suggest that OCD patients who respond to an adequate trial of a serotonergic antidepressant should stay on that medication for at least one to two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. However, this needs further study. If the medication is discontinued, American Psychiatric Association practice guidelines recommend that it should be slowly tapered (eg, 10 to 25 percent every one to two months). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H88196066\"><span class=\"h2\">Other medications as monotherapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is a paucity of data supporting the use of other medications as monotherapy for OCD. No other drugs are approved for the disorder by the Food and Drug Administration in the United States. Small, limited trials have suggested possible benefits of several other agents: <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mirtazapine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mirtazapine</a> (an antagonist at presynaptic alpha-2 adrenergic, 5-HT2, and 5-HT3 receptors) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-adults/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>], <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tramadol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tramadol</a> (an agonist at the mu opioid receptor as well as a modulator of noradrenergic and serotonergic systems) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>], and stimulants (eg, D-amphetamine) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pharmacotherapy-for-obsessive-compulsive-disorder-in-adults/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>]. All require further study with randomized trials to determine efficacy for OCD. Medications intended to target the glutamatergic system either at monotherapy or as an adjunct to SSRIs are also receiving increased attention. (See <a href=\"#H19408557\" class=\"local\">'Glutamatergic medications'</a> below.)</p><p>There are no randomized trials of antipsychotic medications as monotherapy for OCD.
