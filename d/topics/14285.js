A headache diary is useful for estimating the number and severity of headaches each month and for identifying precipitating factors so that so they can be managed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F64049\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef64049 \">form 1</a>).

Lower quality evidence suggests but does not establish that calcium channel blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are effective for migraine prevention. There are no clinical trial data for thiazide diuretics in migraine prevention.</p><p>Blood pressure treatment appears to reduce the overall prevalence of headache in general. This point is illustrated by the results of a meta-analysis of 94 randomized controlled trials examining four different classes of antihypertensive medications (beta blockers, ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and thiazides) that also included data on headache prevalence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-treatment-of-migraine-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Patients assigned to blood pressure treatment had a significant reduction in headache prevalence compared with placebo treatment (odds ratio 0.67, 95% CI 0.61-0.74), and headache prevalence was significantly reduced in each of the four classes of drugs compared individually with placebo. One limitation is that the individual trials lacked information on headache classification, so the proportion of migraine versus other types of headaches among the subjects is unknown. However, it is conceivable that most of the patients had migraine, as the prevalence of headache among placebo patients (12.4 percent) is similar to the reported prevalence of migraine in the general population.

The small size of this trial limits the strength of the findings.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonpharmacologic interventions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonpharmacologic therapies with at least moderate-quality evidence suggesting benefit for migraine headache prevention include aerobic exercise, biofeedback, other forms of relaxation training, cognitive-behavioral therapies, acupuncture, and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-treatment-of-migraine-in-adults/abstract/74-78\" class=\"abstract_t\">74-78</a>]. Several of these are discussed in greater detail in the sections that follow.

(See <a href=\"#H1618032061\" class=\"local\">'Lifestyle measures'</a> above.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h3\">Acupuncture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical trial evidence suggests that classic acupuncture for migraine headache is more effective than oral pharmacologic placebos, but probably not more effective than sham needling or traditional medical therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-treatment-of-migraine-in-adults/abstract/79-83\" class=\"abstract_t\">79-83</a>]. The following reports support this conclusion:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A randomized controlled trial with 302 patients found that acupuncture was <strong>not</strong> more effective than sham acupuncture (needling at points distant from &quot;true&quot; treatment points and using fewer needles) in reducing migraine headaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-treatment-of-migraine-in-adults/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. However, both acupuncture and sham acupuncture were significantly more effective in reducing days with headache than assignment to a wait-list control group.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another randomized controlled trial with 794 patients available for intention-to-treat analysis, the reduction in migraine headache days at 23 to 25 weeks for acupuncture, sham acupuncture, or standard medical therapy groups (mean reduction 2.3, 1.5, and 2.1 days, respectively) was statistically significant when compared with baseline, but nonsignificant across treatment groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-treatment-of-migraine-in-adults/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>].</p><p/><p>Although the explanation for these results is uncertain, one hypothesis is that, compared with oral pharmacologic placebos, the placebo effect of sham acupuncture is enhanced by contextual factors such as more elaborate treatment rituals and higher levels of attention and physical contact [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-treatment-of-migraine-in-adults/abstract/82,86,87\" class=\"abstract_t\">82,86,87</a>]. Headache improvement related to nonspecific physiologic effects of needling is another possible mechanism.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H175922845\"><span class=\"h3\">Transcutaneous nerve stimulation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although data are limited, the findings of a controlled trial conducted at five tertiary headache centers in Belgium suggest that treatment with a supraorbital transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulator is beneficial for patients with episodic migraine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-treatment-of-migraine-in-adults/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. The trial randomly assigned 69 adults with migraine (with or without aura) to active or sham stimulation for 20 minutes daily for three months. Exclusion criteria included the use of preventive treatment for migraine in the three months prior to enrollment. At three months of treatment, the responder rate, defined as the percentage of subjects with a &ge;50 percent reduction in migraine days per month, was significantly higher for the active stimulation compared with the sham stimulation group (38.2 versus 12.1 percent), as was the mean reduction in monthly migraine days (-2.1 versus +0.3 days). There were no adverse events in either group. Limitations to this trial include small effect size, low patient numbers, and uncertainty in concealing treatment allocation, given that active stimulation causes intense paresthesia. The device used in this trial is approved for marketing in the United States, Canada, Europe, and several additional countries. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H342482945\"><span class=\"h3\">Coping with headache triggers</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Traditional teaching is that avoidance of known migraine trigger factors is a useful strategy for migraine prevention, but there is scant evidence to support this approach. Some studies suggest that avoidance of trigger factors may paradoxically lead to trigger sensitization, particularly since many known triggers cannot be completely avoided [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-treatment-of-migraine-in-adults/abstract/78,89\" class=\"abstract_t\">78,89</a>]. These reports suggest that coping with headache triggers is potentially a more valuable strategy than advice to avoid the triggers.</p><p>Since there is an important behavioral component to many of the known headache triggers, behavioral therapies are a potentially useful means of coping with these triggers. One behavioral method, learning to cope (LTC), involves graduated exposure to selected headache triggers to promote desensitization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-treatment-of-migraine-in-adults/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. In a small, single-center randomized controlled trial of patients with migraine or tension-type headache, the group assigned to the LTC strategy had a significant reduction in both headache and medication use compared with the control group, while the group assigned to trigger avoidance had no significant reduction in headache or medication use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-treatment-of-migraine-in-adults/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. A third group assigned to trigger avoidance plus cognitive-behavioral therapy had a significant reduction in headaches but not medication use. These data suggest that LTC is a better strategy than avoidance, but further study is needed to establish whether it is an effective and practical approach to migraine prevention.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h3\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Results from a single-center, blinded, randomized controlled trial suggest that surgical removal of muscle or nerve tissue from headache &quot;trigger sites&quot; may be an effective treatment for select patients with frequent migraine headache [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-treatment-of-migraine-in-adults/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. However, the trial results have been received with skepticism by some headache experts due to methodologic flaws including poor case definition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-treatment-of-migraine-in-adults/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. In addition, the proposed mechanism of benefit (trigger site deactivation) does not fit with current pathophysiologic models of migraine.</p><p>The trial screened 317 patients with frequent moderate to severe migraine headache (with or without aura) and found 76 who were eligible for inclusion, which required both identification of the predominant &quot;trigger site&quot; where &quot;migraine pain started and settled consistently&quot; and a positive response to botulinum toxin injection at the trigger site [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-treatment-of-migraine-in-adults/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. Eligible patients, who had approximately 10 migraine headaches per month at baseline, were randomly assigned to treatment with either actual surgery (n = 49) or sham surgery (n = 26) at their trigger site.</p><p>Actual surgery involved removal of glabellar muscles from patients with frontal trigger sites, removal of a segment of the zygomaticotemporal branch of the trigeminal nerve from those with temporal trigger sites, and resection of a segment of the semispinalis capitis muscle (under general anesthesia) from those with occipital trigger sites [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-treatment-of-migraine-in-adults/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. The sham surgery group had exposure but not resection of the muscles and nerves through a similar incision. At 12 months, actual surgery was statistically superior to sham surgery on a variety of outcome measures, including complete elimination of migraine headaches (57 versus 4 percent), and a reduction of &ge;50 percent in the migraine headache index, calculated by multiplying the headache frequency, intensity, and duration (84 versus 58 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-treatment-of-migraine-in-adults/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. Confidence intervals were not reported. Improvement with surgery was independent of trigger site. The surgery was well tolerated.</p><p>Given the methodologic flaws in the study design [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-treatment-of-migraine-in-adults/abstract/92,93\" class=\"abstract_t\">92,93</a>], independent confirmation of benefit in more rigorous trials is needed. In addition, only a minority of patients with frequent migraine (those with identifiable trigger sites and a positive response to botulinum toxin injection) would appear to be candidates.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h3\">Closure of right-to-left cardiac shunt</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is conflicting evidence regarding a possible association of migraine with aura and right-to-left cardiac shunts in the setting of a patent foramen ovale (PFO) or an atrial septal defect, as reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-migraine-in-adults#H140724624\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of migraine in adults&quot;, section on 'Right-to-left cardiac shunt'</a>.)</p><p>However, there is evidence from randomized controlled trials that <span class=\"nowrap\">PFO/ASD</span> closure is not an effective treatment for migraine. The multicenter double-blind MIST trial enrolled 147 patients with a PFO who had frequent migraine with aura that was refractory to two types of preventive medication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-treatment-of-migraine-in-adults/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. Patients with prior stroke or transient ischemic attack were excluded. During a three-month healing phase, patients in both treatment groups received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a>. At six months, there was no difference between PFO device closure and sham treatment for the primary end point of headache cure, which was achieved in each treatment group by three patients (4 percent). Furthermore, the PFO closure group experienced more serious adverse events than the sham group. The smaller open-label PRIMA trial, which was stopped prematurely due to slow recruitment, compared PFO device closure with medical management among subjects with migraine with aura [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-treatment-of-migraine-in-adults/abstract/95\" class=\"abstract_t\">95</a>]. At one year, there was no statistically significant difference between groups for reduction in monthly migraine days. </p><p>In earlier reports, which were relatively small and largely retrospective, improvement in migraine after device closure of a PFO or an atrial septal defect was noted in some (but not all) studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preventive-treatment-of-migraine-in-adults/abstract/96-106\" class=\"abstract_t\">96-106</a>]. Most of the patients treated with shunt closure were selected because of prior cryptogenic stroke or paradoxical embolism. A majority of study patients were treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clopidogrel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clopidogrel</a>, which may have reduced migraine frequency.</p><p>In summary, the observational studies that reported improvement in migraine with PFO closure were flawed, and the only randomized controlled trial found no benefit.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3283292913\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
