The mortality of blunt abdominal trauma in children is directly related to the number of structures injured: it is less than 20 percent in isolated liver, spleen, kidney, or pancreatic trauma; increases to 20 percent if the gastrointestinal tract is involved; and increases to 50 percent if major vessels are injured [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1500175702\"><span class=\"h1\">STABILIZATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The initial management of children with suspected intraabdominal injury (IAI) should adhere to the Advanced Trauma Life Support guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of immediately life-threatening injuries (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F64241\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64241 \">figure 1</a>).

Because optimal care and outcomes occur when the critically injured child is initially resuscitated and subsequently managed in a pediatric trauma center (PTC), it is preferable to provide initial care in such facilities from the outset, whenever possible, or to arrange transfer to a PTC for ongoing management.

As an example, in a large, prospective multicenter trial of 10,176 children two years of age or older with blunt torso trauma, any reported abdominal pain was associated with a 13 percent risk of IAI compared to a 2 percent risk of IAI in patients with a Glasgow coma scale of 15 and no pain or tenderness on physical examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with blunt abdominal trauma warrant a complete physical examination as part of the secondary survey and consistent with the principles of Advanced Trauma Life Support.

Although not definitive, these findings may indicate ongoing intraabdominal hemorrhage. Significant intraabdominal hemorrhage in children can be masked by their ability to maintain normal systolic blood pressure despite large volume blood loss.

Abdominal tenderness may be especially difficult to determine in children younger than three years of age who are frightened and crying and in older children who are uncooperative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-children/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p>In patients with vomiting, abdominal distension, altered mental status, or suspicion for significant abdominal injury, a nasogastric or, in patients with maxillofacial trauma, an orogastric tube should be placed before abdominal examination.

Thus, most patients with a seat belt sign warrant definitive determination of IAI (computed tomography [CT] of the abdomen and pelvis in stable patients or laparotomy in unstable patients who do not respond to fluid resuscitation and blood transfusion). Alert patients without abdominal tenderness who have the seat belt sign still have a significant risk of IAI and, at a minimum, warrant continued observation and laboratory evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

Abdominal bruises had a sensitivity and specificity for IAI of 74 and 99 percent, respectively. Among patients without abdominal wall bruising, the negative predictive value for IAI was 99.9 percent.

A greater number of hollow viscus or mesenteric injuries in children with a seat belt sign accounted for the difference in rates of IAI between the groups. The seat belt sign was independently associated with IAI after adjustment for vomiting, hypotension, altered mental status, evidence of thoracic trauma, and abdominal or costal margin pain (risk ratio [RR] 1.8, 95% CI 1.3-2.4). Among patients with normal or near-normal mental status and <strong>no</strong> abdominal tenderness, IAI occurred in 6 percent of the 194 patients with a seat belt sign and 2 percent of the 1714 patients without.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Associated injuries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tenderness during palpation of the lower ribs may indicate rib fracture.

The specificity for intraabdominal injury was 4 percent greater among those patients who received oral contrast (85 versus 81 percent). Patients who received oral contrast had a significantly longer delay (median 12 minutes) in undergoing CT compared with children who received IV contrast alone. Thus, trauma centers that only use IV contrast report similar detection of abdominal injuries during the initial evaluation of children with blunt abdominal trauma when compared to centers that continue to use oral and IV contrast.</p><p>In addition, oral contrast has the following practical limitations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delayed time to CT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-children/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vomiting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-children/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>] although low rates of aspiration have been documented in retrospective studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-children/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inadequate penetration and visualization of the small or large bowel which, based upon one small observational study, may occur in up to 60 percent of children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-children/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>] </p><p/><p>Of these, the delay in determination of intraabdominal injury in the stable pediatric trauma patient is of greatest concern, especially in patients with time sensitive injuries to other parts of the body such as the head, chest, or extremities. </p><p>Initial CT alone is less sensitive in detecting injuries of the pancreas, intestinal tract, and bladder.

A multicenter, prospective observational study of 12,044 children with blunt torso trauma has derived clinical features that predict a very low risk of IAI requiring intervention (eg, laparotomy, angiographic embolization, blood transfusion, or hospitalization for two nights or longer) as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Glasgow coma scale &ge;14</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No evidence of abdominal wall trauma or seat belt sign</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No abdominal tenderness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No complaints of abdominal pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No thoracic wall trauma</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>No decreased breath sounds</p><p/><p>The absolute risk of IAI for the 5034 children who met all seven of these criteria was 0.1 percent. However, 23 percent of these patients underwent abdominal and pelvic CT. The six very low-risk patients who did have IAI had other features commonly associated with IAI (eg, hematuria, elevated liver enzymes, a distracting injury, or ethanol intoxication). Thus, implementation of this rule, if validated, has significant potential to reduce the number of abdominal and pelvic CTs in children. The authors note that failure to meet the very low-risk criteria derived in this study is <strong>not</strong> necessarily an indication for abdominal and pelvic CT and that further validation of these criteria are needed before widespread use can be recommended.</p><p>In a planned analysis of 3819 children from the low-risk IAI rule derivation study in whom abdominal CT was normal, the sensitivity and specificity for any IAI were 98 and 82 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-children/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Only six patients (0.2 percent) subsequently received an acute intervention after CT.

For example, unstable children with blunt abdominal trauma and intraperitoneal fluid on FAST may warrant operative intervention in lieu of CT of the abdomen and pelvics. In the stable patient, the presence of intraperitoneal fluid on FAST indicates the need for abdominal CT. However, a negative FAST does not have adequate sensitivity or specificity to exclude IAI, especially solid organ injury.

Initial evaluation of pediatric trauma patients should first address life-threatening injuries that compromise airway, breathing, and circulation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F64241\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64241 \">figure 1</a>). Hemodynamically unstable children with suspected intraabdominal injury (IAI) who are not responsive to intravenous crystalloid and blood transfusions during stabilization warrant emergent laparotomy. (See <a href=\"#H1500175702\" class=\"local\">'Stabilization'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1500176740\" class=\"local\">'Laparotomy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In hemodynamically stable patients, assessment for blunt IAI should take place as part of the secondary survey. (See <a href=\"#H1500175702\" class=\"local\">'Stabilization'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mechanisms of blunt injury that are associated with IAI include isolated, high-energy blows to the abdomen (eg, fall from a bicycle on to the handlebar) and high-risk trauma mechanisms including motor vehicle collisions, seat belt usage, and falls from a height greater than 10 feet or two to three times the patient&rsquo;s height (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F57293\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef57293 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1500170517\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Signs of IAI include ecchymoses (particularly of the umbilical or flank regions); abrasions; tire-track marks; seat-belt marks; abdominal distension, tenderness, rigidity, or masses; pain in the left shoulder induced by palpation of the left upper quadrant (Kehr's sign); or prolonged ileus (greater than four hours). Signs of abdominal injury are variable and may evolve over time necessitating serial examinations. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Abdomen'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Associated injuries'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>IAI can be obscured by concurrent extraabdominal injury (eg, head trauma, thoracic trauma, extremity fracture). In addition, the examination may be unreliable if the patient's neurologic status is impaired due to brain or spinal cord injury or substance use, and in children younger than two to three years of age or who are otherwise uncooperative. Such patients should be assumed to be at significant risk of IAI. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Abdomen'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The laboratory evaluation of children with blunt abdominal trauma varies depending upon the severity of trauma and clinical suspicion for IAI as follows (see <a href=\"#H1500169994\" class=\"local\">'Approach'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Children with hemodynamic instability due to suspected IAI that is unresponsive to fluid resuscitation and blood transfusion require emergent laparotomy; preoperative laboratories, especially a complete blood count and blood type and crossmatch, should be obtained in a manner that does not delay operative care. Hemoglobin and hematocrit should be followed serially (eg, every 30 minutes) in these patients because the initial hemoglobin and hematocrit in a patient with acute blood loss can be normal if equilibration of intravascular volume has not yet occurred. Other laboratory studies may be obtained as well to have baseline measurements including prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT), serum electrolytes, glucose, amylase, lipase, transaminases (alanine aminotransferase [ALT], and aspartate aminotransferase [AST]). However, operative care should occur without waiting for these laboratory results. (See <a href=\"#H1500176740\" class=\"local\">'Laparotomy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Hemoglobin and hematocrit'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hemodynamically stable children with clinical signs of IAI should undergo emergent computed tomography (CT) scanning of the abdomen and pelvics without waiting for laboratory results. Laboratory studies for these patients should, at a minimum, include a complete blood count, urinalysis, serum transaminases (alanine aminotransferase [ALT] and aspartate aminotransferase [AST]) and a type and crossmatch. Although other laboratory studies as described for hemodynamically unstable patients may be obtained, the results should not be used to decide the need for computed tomography (CT). (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Liver transaminases'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Urinalysis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Abdominal and pelvic CT'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hemodynamically stable children who are alert, cooperative, and have a normal physical examination but a concerning mechanism of injury may occasionally have IAI that can be identified by serial abdominal examination and laboratory testing. We recommend that these patients undergo laboratory testing that consists of a hemoglobin and hematocrit, urinalysis, and serum liver transaminases (AST and ALT). (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Hemoglobin and hematocrit'</a> above and <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Urinalysis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Liver transaminases'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ultrasonography is useful, when available, for the rapid, early evaluation of hemodynamically unstable children with potential blunt abdominal trauma. Because ultrasonography lacks adequate sensitivity, abdominal and pelvic CT with intravenous (IV) contrast is usually performed in all hemodynamically stable patients with clinical findings suggestive of IAI regardless of ultrasound results. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Ultrasonography'</a> above and <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Abdominal and pelvic CT'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abdominal and pelvic CT with IV contrast is the preferred diagnostic imaging modality to detect IAI in hemodynamically stable children who clinical findings suggesting IAI. Our approach is to perform the initial abdominal and pelvic CT using IV contrast only. Indications for abdominal and pelvic CT in children with serious blunt abdominal trauma are provided. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Abdominal and pelvic CT'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Definitive management of children with IAI after blunt trauma should be determined by a pediatric surgeon with trauma expertise, whenever possible. Most hemodynamically stable children with IAI can be managed nonoperatively. (See <a href=\"#H1500177208\" class=\"local\">'Definitive management'</a> above and <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Specific injuries'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Holmes JF, Lillis K, Monroe D, et al.
