Aspiration abortion is very safe with a mortality rate of 0.6 per 100,000 terminations compared with the pregnancy-associated mortality rate of 17 to 28 per 100,000 live births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-preparation-for-dilation-and-evacuation-abortion/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].</p><p>The vast majority of all abortions occur in the first trimester with only 1.3 percent after 20 weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-preparation-for-dilation-and-evacuation-abortion/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Patients undergoing termination in the second trimester usually undergo a standard dilation and evacuation (D&amp;E) procedure. Although complications are rare, morbidity and mortality related to abortion increase with gestational age. Beyond 12 weeks, this increase is approximately 20 percent per week of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-preparation-for-dilation-and-evacuation-abortion/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Risks are decreased with use of cervical preparation, which generally includes preoperative use of osmotic dilators <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> administration of cervical ripening agents.</p><p>Cervical preparation for D&amp;E is reviewed here. Other aspects of pregnancy termination are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-pregnancy-termination\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of pregnancy termination&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=first-trimester-pregnancy-termination-uterine-aspiration\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;First-trimester pregnancy termination: Uterine aspiration&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-second-trimester-pregnancy-termination\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of second-trimester pregnancy termination&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2095737840\"><span class=\"h1\">OVERVIEW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goal of cervical preparation prior to aspiration abortion is to facilitate the evacuation of the uterus and to decrease cervical trauma during a D&amp;E procedure. Cervical preparation methods soften and dilate the cervix prior to D&amp;E with the goal of minimizing adverse events, such as cervical laceration or uterine perforation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-preparation-for-dilation-and-evacuation-abortion/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>Historically, aspiration abortion had been done without cervical preparation. Cervical preparation in the second trimester became common practice in the late 1970s after a decrease in complications was found with the use of osmotic dilators. This was illustrated in a large retrospective review from 1983 of nearly 12,000 patients undergoing D&amp;E [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-preparation-for-dilation-and-evacuation-abortion/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. With introduction of routine use of laminaria in 1977, the rate of cervical laceration decreased. Prior to this time, the cervical laceration rate at 18 to 21 weeks of gestation was 5 to 8 percent; afterwards, the rate was 1.4 to 1.6 percent. Subsequent small retrospective trials revealed similarly low rates of bleeding and cervical laceration when cervical preparation was used prior to mechanical dilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-preparation-for-dilation-and-evacuation-abortion/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].</p><p>If the patient is in the first trimester, mechanical dilation is usually sufficient. In the second trimester, typically preprocedure osmotic dilators or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> are used, with mechanical dilation used only if necessary. If the cervix is already dilated, as with an incompetent cervix, cervical preparation may not be necessary.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3880025142\"><span class=\"h1\">CERVICAL PREPARATION MODALITIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are several methods and techniques for cervical preparation prior to aspiration abortion; they may be used alone or in combination. These include osmotic dilators and the cervical ripening agents, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> (a prostaglandin), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mifepristone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mifepristone</a> (an antiprogesterone). Mechanical dilation is done at the time of the procedure if dilation from cervical preparation is insufficient. Avoidance of mechanical dilation lowers the risk of complications and may decrease pain.</p><p>Several factors guide the choice of a cervical preparation approach, including safety, cervical dilation required to perform the procedure, surgical skill, and patient comfort. At later gestational ages, more dilation is required. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1964076317\"><span class=\"h2\">Osmotic dilators</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Osmotic dilators are rod-shaped items that are placed in the cervical os and dilate gradually as they absorb moisture. They are placed from four hours up to two days prior to the procedure, depending upon the type of osmotic dilator used, the degree of dilation required, and whether a concomitant cervical ripening medication is used. Osmotic dilators are one of the most common methods of cervical preparation for mid- to late-second-trimester D&amp;E procedures. Typically, they are used for cervical preparation beginning at 14 to 18 weeks, but this varies by clinician.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2627337199\"><span class=\"h3\">Types of osmotic dilators</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main two osmotic dilators that are commercially available are laminaria japonica and Dilapan-S. Another osmotic dilator, Lamicel, went out of production in 2008.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laminaria japonica &ndash; Laminaria japonica dilators (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F87446\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87446 \">picture 1</a>) are sterilized and dried seaweed stems that function by absorbing fluid and expanding slowly. Use of laminaria for cervical dilation is mentioned in the medical literature as early as 1869 by Dr. Braxton-Hicks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-preparation-for-dilation-and-evacuation-abortion/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. Dry laminaria range in size from a diameter of 2 mm to 10 mm and are approximately 60 mm in length. Typically, laminaria are placed on the day prior to the procedure and left in place for approximately 24 hours. By that time, each laminaria has expanded to more than 2.5 times its dry diameter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-preparation-for-dilation-and-evacuation-abortion/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. In vitro, a 3 mm laminaria will expand to an average of 9.8 mm. A disadvantage of laminaria is that they may dilate unevenly and, because they are a natural product, some laminaria rods may expand more than others. These irregularities in expansion of laminaria can result in variability of dilation among patients, despite the same number of laminaria used, and thus increased need for mechanical dilation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dilapan-S &ndash; Dilapan-S (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F87447\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef87447 \">picture 2</a>) is made of hydrophilic polymers. The initial form, Dilapan, was prone to breakage, and this issue led to a new formulation, Dilapan-S, in 2002 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-preparation-for-dilation-and-evacuation-abortion/abstract/7,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,13</a>]. Dilapan-S is available in 3 mm and 4 mm diameters and is 55 mm in length. Initial dilation occurs over four to six hours and continues to expand over the course of 24 hours to over 3.5 times its dry diameter. In vitro, the 3 mm Dilapan-S expands to an average of 10.3 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-preparation-for-dilation-and-evacuation-abortion/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. An advantage of Dilapan-S is that it dilates more quickly and evenly than laminaria. A disadvantage is that it may dilate unevenly across the length of the dilator. This is referred to as &quot;dumbbelling,&quot; during which the proximal and distal ends dilate, but the portion that is within the internal cervical os does not. This forms a dumbbell or hourglass shape which can result in inadequate dilation and need for subsequent mechanical dilation. At times, dumbbelling can make removal of Dilapan-S very difficult, which may necessitate need for further cervical preparation and delay of the procedure. (See <a href=\"#H3358911066\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Fewer Dilapan-S than laminaria are needed to generate the same cervical dilation, and Dilapan-S generate dilation more quickly and dilate to a more consistent diameter than do laminaria. However, these two types of osmotic dilators appear to have comparable efficacy. A randomized trial (n = 180) comparing Dilapan-S with laminaria evaluated two gestational age cohorts: 18 to 20 weeks and 6 days (20+6 weeks) and 21 to 23+6 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-preparation-for-dilation-and-evacuation-abortion/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. There were no differences in operative duration between dilator types in either gestational age cohort. There were also no differences in procedure difficulty, pain, or dilation. Of note, there were 24 cases that could not be completed on the first attempt and required adjunctive methods; 75 percent of those cases were in the laminaria group, and there was a significantly higher rate of need for adjunctive methods with laminaria in the earlier gestational cohort.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2199426159\"><span class=\"h3\">Timing and duration</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Overnight dilation with osmotic dilators is recommended for most D&amp;E procedures at 18 or more weeks. The patient has the dilators placed on one day and then returns the next day to have them removed.</p><p>There are some data to show that same-day osmotic dilation with Dilapan-S can be used between 14 to 18 weeks. A randomized trial in women undergoing D&amp;E at 14 to 17+6 weeks of gestation found that overnight laminaria resulted in significantly more dilation than same-day Dilapan-S, but there was no difference in blood loss, procedural difficulty, or complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-preparation-for-dilation-and-evacuation-abortion/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H2055116461\" class=\"local\">'14 to &lt;18 weeks'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H499397886\"><span class=\"h3\">Number of dilators</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no studies to guide the number of osmotic dilators that should be placed in the cervical os, and expert opinion varies widely on the optimal number.</p><p>The number of dilators is guided by clinical teaching and experience. Some experienced clinicians recommend placing dilators until they fit snugly, but not tightly, in the cervix. Others advocate that the total number of osmotic dilators equals the patient's &quot;gestational age minus 10.&quot; Others recommend placing five Dilapan-S for 20 weeks of gestation with an additional Dilapan-S for each subsequent week of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-preparation-for-dilation-and-evacuation-abortion/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. Still others recommend placing three Dilapan-S for 18 to 21+6 weeks of gestation with adjuvant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> for three to four hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-preparation-for-dilation-and-evacuation-abortion/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Institutions or clinics tend to have shared practices or protocols to guide the number, timing, and type of dilator. The table includes some examples of cervical preparation guidelines from several hospital-based and independent abortion clinics (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F115469\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115469 \">table 1</a>). However, even within an individual clinic, there may be variation in practice across clinicians. Given the wide range in practices and the lack of high-quality data to evaluate each protocol, the number of dilators used for cervical preparation will continue to be individualized based on clinician preference and patient characteristics until best practices can be established.</p><p>There is no standard regarding a maximum number of dilators that may be placed; however, the authors have rarely seen a need for more than 12 Dilapan-S or 14 laminaria, especially when combined with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mifepristone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mifepristone</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3358911066\"><span class=\"h3\">Complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complications of osmotic dilator use are rare, but potential complications include onset of labor, extramural delivery (outside of a health care facility), infection, uterine perforation, and allergic reaction. Other issues with dilator placement may include inadequate dilation, difficulty removing the dilator, or expulsion. Any patient with osmotic dilators in place should be given a 24-hour emergency phone number to reach a clinician for any pain, bleeding, or leaking of fluid so that infection and preterm labor can be managed appropriately.</p><p>Onset of labor is rare with use of osmotic dilators and extramural delivery is even more infrequent. Based on a series of 1000 D&amp;E procedures in pregnancies between 17 to 25 weeks of gestation, the rate of onset of labor is approximately 1 in 500 procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-preparation-for-dilation-and-evacuation-abortion/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. This study used adjuvant intrauterine urea injections, which may increase the risk of labor and is no longer commonly used. Because onset of labor is a very rare complication when intra-amniotic injections are not performed, it is hard to estimate the incidence. When a feticidal agent is administered, the reported incidence of extramural delivery is 0.3 to 1.9 percent. The highest incidence was seen with intra-amniotic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-preparation-for-dilation-and-evacuation-abortion/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=induced-fetal-demise\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Induced fetal demise&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The risk of infection is very low; there are few reports of infection after dilator placement alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-preparation-for-dilation-and-evacuation-abortion/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. The low infection rate could be the result of dilator sterilization or the routine practice of prophylactic antibiotics for surgical abortion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F87200\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87200 \">table 2</a>). Our practice is to begin prophylactic antibiotics at the time dilators are placed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F87200\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef87200 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>Uterine perforation at the time of osmotic dilator placement is exceedingly rare. However, if the dilator is not placed appropriately inside the cervical canal, a &quot;false passage&quot; may be created that could increase risk of a subsequent perforation. Therefore, it is imperative to keep the dilators within the cervical canal, and if any concern regarding the cervical canal anatomy arises, an ultrasound may be used to verify the location of the osmotic dilator.</p><p>Anaphylaxis to laminaria has been documented in case reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-preparation-for-dilation-and-evacuation-abortion/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. The authors are not aware of any cases of hypersensitivity to the synthetic dilator Dilapan-S.</p><p>In some cases, osmotic dilators are difficult to remove. At the time of surgery, if the dilators cannot be removed without excessive force, do not continue. If a combination of laminaria and Dilapan-S were placed, try removing the laminaria first, as removal of this &quot;keystone&quot; may facilitate removal of the remaining dilators. If this does not work consider placing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> 400 to 600 mcg vaginally, waiting 2 to 3 hours and reexamining the patient. If the dilators still cannot be removed, an additional dose of misoprostol (400 mcg) may be given either vaginally or buccally and the patient reexamined after an additional 1 to 2 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-preparation-for-dilation-and-evacuation-abortion/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Another issue may be that after dilators are removed, the amount of dilation is inadequate. Some practitioners will attempt to pass a Sopher or Bierer forceps to ascertain if dilation is adequate. As with cases of dumbelled dilators, sometimes the internal os is not dilated as widely as the external os. A clinician can attempt to dilate using mechanical dilators. It is crucial that care be taken during mechanical dilation such that excessive force is not administered or the cervix lacerated. If the cervix is inadequately dilated and adequate mechanical dilation cannot be obtained, options include the following: Give <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> and wait three to four hours, or insert additional Dilapan-S (with or without vaginal misoprostol) and wait at least four hours. Another option would be to reinsert dilators and have the patient return the next day. (See <a href=\"#H2627337199\" class=\"local\">'Types of osmotic dilators'</a> above.)</p><p>Expulsion of dilators without sufficient dilation is rare, especially when dilators are placed correctly. It is important that patients are counseled not to discard dilators if they are expelled. We recommend they place the dilator in a bag or plastic wrap if one is expelled. Visualization of the dilators is the best way to ensure no dilator is left in the uterus after the procedure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H377754348\"><span class=\"h2\">Cervical ripening medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cervical ripening agents are medications that help to soften the cervix and make it easier to dilate with osmotic or mechanical dilators. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3712590208\"><span class=\"h3\">Misoprostol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Misoprostol</a> is a prostaglandin E1 analogue that is used commonly for cervical preparation.

The World Health Organization identifies misoprostol as a medication essential for basic health care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-preparation-for-dilation-and-evacuation-abortion/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Misoprostol</a> may be used alone or in combination with osmotic dilators.

Routes of administration of misoprostol are discussed in detail separately.</p><p>Pharmacokinetic studies have included oral, sublingual, buccal, vaginal, and rectal routes of administration. A systematic review [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-preparation-for-dilation-and-evacuation-abortion/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>] evaluated vaginal doses ranging from 100 to 750 mcg, oral doses 400 to 600 mcg, and a sublingual dose of 400 mcg. All studies found increased baseline cervical dilation.</p><p>For first-trimester abortion, randomized trials have compared <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> 400 mcg administered either orally or vaginally. The vaginal route is superior in terms of dilation achieved as well as milder side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-preparation-for-dilation-and-evacuation-abortion/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. Other studies have compared 400 mcg sublingual misoprostol with 400 mcg oral misoprostol and have found greater dilation and fewer side effects with sublingual administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-preparation-for-dilation-and-evacuation-abortion/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>].

Buccal administration has similar efficacy as vaginal administration and fewer side effects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-preparation-for-dilation-and-evacuation-abortion/abstract/30,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,38</a>].</p><p>The time interval between <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> administration and the D&amp;E also varies across clinicians. The largest case series of misoprostol alone is from Planned Parenthood of Los Angeles and included 6620 women from 12 to 16 weeks. Vaginal or buccal misoprostol 400 mcg was administered approximately 90 minutes prior to procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-preparation-for-dilation-and-evacuation-abortion/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Another common dose is 400 mcg buccally three hours prior to D&amp;E at gestations less than 16 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-preparation-for-dilation-and-evacuation-abortion/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>There are no randomized trials comparing different misoprostol-only regimens for cervical preparation prior to second-trimester D&amp;E; the available data are from retrospective cohort studies.

In second-trimester D&amp;E, mechanical dilation is typically used only after cervical preparation with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mifepristone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mifepristone</a>, osmotic dilators, or a combination of these measures; however, mechanical dilation is often used alone for first-trimester procedures.</p><p>Risks of mechanical dilation include cervical laceration and uterine perforation. A false passage can be created by inserting into the cervical stroma rather than the os. This increases the chance of a cervical or uterine perforation. The risk is increased with prior cesarean delivery, since scar tissue may be present and may affect the angle of the cervical canal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-preparation-for-dilation-and-evacuation-abortion/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. If a clinician is uncertain that a mechanical dilator is place correctly, ultrasound may be used during the procedure to guide insertion and avoid uterine perforation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=uterine-perforation-during-gynecologic-procedures#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Uterine perforation during gynecologic procedures&quot;, section on 'Prevention'</a>.)</p><p>The incidence of complications associated with mechanical dilation is low, but is reduced by additional cervical preparation. As an example, in a large retrospective study of nearly 12,000 second-trimester D&amp;E procedures, use of rigid dilation alone was associated with a higher incidence of cervical laceration, especially at later gestational ages: mechanical dilation alone (laceration rates: 0.8 to 0.9 percent at 13 to 17 weeks; 5 to 8 percent at 18 to 21 weeks); selective laminaria use (0 to 0.6 percent at 13 to 17 weeks; 1.4 to 1.6 percent at 18 to 21 weeks) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-preparation-for-dilation-and-evacuation-abortion/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3574530242\"><span class=\"h1\">APPROACH BY GESTATIONAL AGE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The key determinants to our approach to cervical preparation are biparietal diameter and patient factors. For example, later gestational age and certain fetal anomalies will result in an increased biparietal diameter that necessitates greater dilation. Patient factors such as prior cervical surgery, fibroids, uterine anomalies, or nulliparity also guide the approach. For example, if a patient has a large, lower uterine segment fibroid, more dilation may be needed to reach the fetus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3264472893\"><span class=\"h2\">&lt;14 weeks</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For most women who undergo aspiration abortion in the first trimester (&lt;14 weeks of gestation), we suggest NOT using cervical preparation (with osmotic dilators or medications). Typically, this is done as a same-day procedure and mechanical dilation alone is safe and effective.</p><p>This recommendation is consistent with Society of Family Planning (SFP) guidelines, which advise against routine cervical priming with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> in the first trimester [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-preparation-for-dilation-and-evacuation-abortion/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

SFP guidelines recommend that cervical preparation be considered for adolescents at 12 to 14 weeks of gestation and when there is concern that dilation is expected to be challenging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-preparation-for-dilation-and-evacuation-abortion/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].</p><p/><p>The best available data regarding the benefits and risks of cervical preparation in first trimester-abortion are from a multicenter randomized trial by the World Health Organization (WHO) Research Group on Postovulatory Methods of Fertility Regulation that included 4972 women at &lt;13 weeks assigned to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> (400 mcg per vagina) or placebo at three hours prior to D&amp;E [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-preparation-for-dilation-and-evacuation-abortion/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Women treated with misoprostol had a lower rate of incomplete abortion from (&lt;1 versus 2 percent). It is not certain whether there were between-center differences in the risk of incomplete abortion, since 4 of 14 centers had no cases of re-evacuation. The number needed to treat to prevent re-evacuation was 1 in 72. The risk of a cervical tear or uterine perforation was less than 1 percent for both groups. Preoperative treatment with misoprostol was associated with significantly more abdominal pain (55 versus 22 percent), vaginal bleeding (37 versus 7 percent), and nausea (7 versus 4 percent).</p><p>Based on the available evidence, we do not think the benefits of cervical preparation at &lt;12 weeks outweigh the adverse effects. The WHO trial found only a modest benefit in the rate of incomplete abortion but no difference in cervical or uterine injury. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Misoprostol</a> resulted in an increased dilation prior to mechanical dilation, but there was no analysis of whether this correlated with the risk of complications or incomplete abortion.

(See <a href=\"#H2095737840\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p>The method of cervical preparation used depends upon several factors. There are several options (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F115469\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115469 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Same-day procedure with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> Dilapan-S at three to four hours preprocedure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two-day procedure with osmotic dilators the day prior to the procedure </p><p/><p>In one of our practices, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> is also given as part of a two-day procedure, but this is given just prior to aspiration rather than at three to four hours prior. The goal of this is to use misoprostol as a uterotonic rather than for cervical preparation.</p><p>In terms of patient experience, same-day preparation entails arriving at clinic several hours before the procedure for administration of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> Dilapan-S. Alternatively, for two-day procedures, dilators are placed, the patient leaves the clinic and returns the next day, the dilators are removed, and the procedure is performed. The patient then avoids a prolonged waiting time at the clinic.</p><p>Overnight dilation with osmotic dilators leads to greater cervical dilation than same-day preparation. This can make the procedure faster and easier from the perspective of the provider. Although it requires two visits, the total time in clinic may be shorter. Same-day procedures offer more flexibility for patients, less time off work, less need for extra childcare, and less time away from home, especially if they travel far to get to the clinic because there are no clinicians who can perform a D&amp;E in their area or their state has legal restrictions on gestational age limits.</p><p>At 14 to &lt;18 weeks of gestation, the evidence supports the efficacy and safety of either same-day <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> or a two-day procedure with overnight dilators. Thus, the main factor guiding the choice is patient preference, with some exceptions regarding clinic resources or individual clinical situations. Studies consistently show that most women prefer a same-day procedure, but women should be counseled about and offered both options. Thus, for women at 14 to &lt;18 weeks who undergo aspiration abortion and who value completing the procedure in one day over spending a longer total duration in clinic, we recommend a same-day procedure. Certainly, some women will prefer and choose a two-day procedure.</p><p>Studies that evaluated same-day compared with overnight procedures include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Same-day versus overnight dilators were found to be comparable in a noninferiority randomized trial in women undergoing D&amp;E at 14 to 17+6 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-preparation-for-dilation-and-evacuation-abortion/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Same-day Dilapan-S was noninferior to overnight laminaria with respect to procedure duration (8.1 minutes versus 5.9 minutes). Overnight laminaria resulted in significantly more dilatation, but there was no difference in blood loss, procedural difficulty, or complications. The majority of patients (72 percent) stated a preference for a one-day procedure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Same-day <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> appears to be comparable with overnight dilators. A randomized trial (n = 84) assigned women at 13 to 16+0 weeks to same-day misoprostol (400 mcg, intravaginal, three to four hours preprocedure) versus overnight laminaria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-preparation-for-dilation-and-evacuation-abortion/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Misoprostol compared with laminaria yielded less preoperative dilation, more cases that required mechanical dilation, slightly longer operative duration (7.2 versus 3.4 minutes), and lower surgeon satisfaction. The differences were even higher in the subset of nulliparous women. Despite these differences, there were no differences in ability to complete the initial procedure or pain, and more participants in the same-day group would choose the same procedure again (93 versus 62 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In another randomized trial (n = 159), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> (400 mcg buccal in the morning on the procedure day; some patient were given a second dose) was compared with overnight dilators in women at 13 to 19+6 weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-preparation-for-dilation-and-evacuation-abortion/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. The misoprostol group had increased difficulty of mechanical dilation. There was no difference in major or minor side effects between groups.

However, the trial was stopped early and did not achieve adequate power.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two options for a two-day protocol were compared in a randomized trial (n = 50) in women at 14 to 16 weeks assigned to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mifepristone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mifepristone</a> or overnight dilators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-preparation-for-dilation-and-evacuation-abortion/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. There were no differences in procedure duration, and patients preferred mifepristone. Most providers in the United States do not use mifepristone at this gestational age, however. This is likely because mifepristone is relatively expensive and because a significant proportion of procedures at this gestation are performed in one day using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a>.</p><p/><p>However, overnight dilation at 14 to &lt;18 weeks may be used when a greater degree of dilation is needed or dilation may be difficult or have a greater risk of complications, is recommended, such as in the following situations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fetal anomalies that lead to a larger biparietal diameter</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An intact procedure is preferred (eg, if an autopsy is desired)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Uterine anomalies that may necessitate more dilation (such as uterine fibroids)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of cervical surgery (eg, cryotherapy or conization)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nulliparous patients</p><p/><p>Overnight dilation is associated with unique risks, such as bleeding, rupture of membranes, infection, preterm labor, and extramural delivery, although these are rare.

In some cases, if dilation is insufficient after overnight dilators, a three-day procedure is performed. This includes dilators placed on day one, then removed and a new greater total diameter set placed on day two, then the D&amp;E on day three. In limited situations, same-day cervical preparation may be possible up to 21 weeks (eg, if a patient travels far and cannot stay overnight), but this should be offered only by experienced clinicians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-preparation-for-dilation-and-evacuation-abortion/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p>For the type of osmotic dilators used, Dilapan-S is typically preferred, but laminaria may be used.

Women treated with mifepristone alone had less dilation and longer procedure duration than the other groups, but duration was similar for dilators with mifepristone compared to dilators without mifepristone (mifepristone alone: 18.5 minutes; dilators with mifepristone: 12 minutes; dilators with placebo: 13 minutes). There were more complications in the mifepristone alone group (mainly cervical laceration or uterine perforation), but this did not reach statistical significance (seven versus zero versus one complication). Patients in the two groups treated with dilators and mifepristone rated their overall experience higher than mifepristone alone.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another randomized trial included a cohort of women at 19 to 23+6 weeks (n = 148) and compared three groups: (1) overnight dilators alone, (2) overnight dilators with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mifepristone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mifepristone</a>, and (3) overnight dilators with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> on the day of D&amp;E [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-preparation-for-dilation-and-evacuation-abortion/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Procedure duration was slightly longer in the dilators alone group (13 versus 9 versus 10 minutes). Fewer procedures were reported to be difficult by the operator in the mifepristone group (dilators alone: 19 percent; mifepristone: 4 percent; misoprostol: 19 percent). There were more complications in the dilators alone group (seven versus two versus one complication). Patients given misoprostol had significantly more pain, fever, and chills. Patient satisfaction was similar across all groups.</p><p/><p>Given the available data, for women who undergo aspiration abortion at 19 to 23+6 weeks, we suggest use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mifepristone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mifepristone</a> in combination with overnight osmotic dilators rather than osmotic dilators alone. For women at 18 weeks, there are insufficient data to make a recommendation, and clinicians typically follow their clinical judgement or the institution's protocol. Similarly, practice varies regarding whether <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> is used on the day of the procedure.</p><p>In addition to osmotic dilators with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mifepristone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mifepristone</a> on the day before the procedure, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> may be given on the day of the procedure. Despite increasing cervical dilation, misoprostol causes more gastrointestinal side effects than mifepristone and more cramping and bleeding, and some providers use mifepristone but not misoprostol. A randomized trial compared cervical dilators combined with misoprostol versus cervical dilators combined with placebo in women 21 to 23+6 weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cervical-preparation-for-dilation-and-evacuation-abortion/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Dilators were placed one day preprocedure, and misoprostol or placebo was given for three to four hours prior to D&amp;E. There was no significant difference in procedure duration (9.7 and 10.4 minutes), blood loss, or satisfaction. However, women receiving misoprostol had significantly more nausea, vomiting, cramping, and pain than those who received placebo. There was significantly more dilation in the misoprostol group (75 mm versus 73 mm); however, this difference is not likely to be clinically significant.</p><p>When <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mifepristone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mifepristone</a> is not used with osmotic dilators at 19 weeks or more, in our practice, we then treat with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> on the day of the procedure in patients with the following characteristics:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An insufficient number of dilators were able to be placed</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Difficult mechanical dilation is anticipated</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adolescents</p><p/><p>Same-day cervical preparation for abortion at gestational ages greater than 18 weeks of gestation has been reported.

The mean number of doses of misoprostol was three (range one to five). The overall complication rate was 1.95 percent.

The aims of cervical preparation are to facilitate the evacuation of the uterus and decrease cervical trauma from mechanical dilation. (See <a href=\"#H2095737840\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Osmotic dilators are rod-shaped items that are placed in the cervical os and dilate gradually as they absorb moisture. They are placed from four hours up to two days prior to the procedure, depending upon the type of osmotic dilator used, the degree of dilation required, and whether a cervical ripening medication is used concomitantly. (See <a href=\"#H1964076317\" class=\"local\">'Osmotic dilators'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cervical ripening agents, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> (a prostaglandin E1 analogue) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mifepristone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mifepristone</a> (an antiprogesterone), are medications that help to soften the cervix and make it easier to dilate with osmotic or mechanical dilators. Misoprostol is typically used on the day of the procedure. Potential side effects of misoprostol include gastrointestinal upset, vomiting, cramping, or vaginal bleeding. Mifepristone is typically used on the day before the procedure and has the advantage of not causing significant gastrointestinal side effects or cramping. (See <a href=\"#H377754348\" class=\"local\">'Cervical ripening medications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cervical preparation may be started one or two days preprocedure or on the day of the procedure. Overnight dilation with osmotic dilators leads to greater cervical dilation than same-day preparation, which can make the procedure faster and potentially safer. Same-day procedures offer more flexibility for patients if having two appointments is a burden. Patients tend to prefer same-day procedures; however, overnight dilation is preferable after 18 weeks of gestation or if dilation may be difficult (eg, history of cervical surgery). (See <a href=\"#H2055116461\" class=\"local\">'14 to &lt;18 weeks'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the first trimester, typically no dilation or mechanical dilation alone is used. For most women who undergo aspiration abortion in the first trimester (&lt;14 weeks of gestation), we suggest NOT using cervical preparation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). It is reasonable to use cervical preparation if difficult mechanical dilation is anticipated or if there is an increased risk of cervical injury, including &ge;12 weeks, mechanical obstruction of the cervix (eg, prior surgery), nulliparas, or adolescents. (See <a href=\"#H3264472893\" class=\"local\">'&lt;14 weeks'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most women at &ge;14 weeks who undergo aspiration abortion, we recommend using cervical preparation rather than no preparation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). The exceptions to this are clinical situations in which cervical preparation is not feasible and an experienced provider determines that proceeding without preparation is appropriate. (See <a href=\"#H2055116461\" class=\"local\">'14 to &lt;18 weeks'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women at &ge;14 to &lt;18 weeks who undergo aspiration abortion who value completing the procedure in one day over spending a longer total duration in clinic, we recommend a same-day rather than a two-day procedure (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). In same-day regimens, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> Dilapan-S are typically used (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F115469\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef115469 \">table 1</a>). Women should be counseled about and offered both options, if feasible. A two-day procedure may be preferred if there are risk factors for difficult mechanical dilation or based on patient preference. (See <a href=\"#H2055116461\" class=\"local\">'14 to &lt;18 weeks'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cervical preparation at &ge;18 weeks typically includes overnight osmotic dilators and may include adjunctive medications. For women who undergo aspiration abortion at 19 to 23+6 weeks, we recommend use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mifepristone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mifepristone</a> in combination with overnight osmotic dilators rather than osmotic dilators alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>).
