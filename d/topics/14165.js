Four factors are particularly important in determining a woman's childbirth experience: personal expectations, the amount of support she receives, the quality of the caregiver-patient relationship, and her involvement in decision-making [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparation-for-labor-and-childbirth/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>This topic will review goals and educational methods that help prepare women for labor and childbirth.

Mothers from all cultures traditionally passed their knowledge about labor and birth to their daughters. These cultural and family rituals guided women through pregnancy, labor, birth, and the early days of mothering. Much of women's wisdom about birth was lost when birth moved from home to hospital. Mothers, sisters, and other women knowledgeable about birth no longer attended the woman. Birth became a medical event and cultural and family rituals took a back seat, eventually all but disappearing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparation-for-labor-and-childbirth/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The development of structured educational programs in preparation for childbirth came about as the traditional methods of information sharing declined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparation-for-labor-and-childbirth/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Nurses and physical therapists who knew a great deal about the mechanics and medical management of pregnancy, labor, and birth, began to educate women about childbirth, largely outside of the health care system. Eventually these professionals became formally trained as childbirth educators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparation-for-labor-and-childbirth/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Childbirth education focused on two things in those early years: the basic anatomy and physiology of labor and birth and simple strategies (typically relaxation and breathing) to cope with the pain of contractions.</p><p>We now know a great deal now about the role of pain in labor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparation-for-labor-and-childbirth/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], the hormonal physiology of labor and childbirth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparation-for-labor-and-childbirth/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], the wide and ever increasing number of ways that women find comfort during labor and birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparation-for-labor-and-childbirth/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], and the importance of continuous emotional and physical support during parturition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparation-for-labor-and-childbirth/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. In addition, some traditional birth practices, such as movement during labor, physiologic pushing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparation-for-labor-and-childbirth/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>], and the upright position for second stage have been shown to be effective practices in controlled studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparation-for-labor-and-childbirth/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>].

Ultimately, preparing for birth can help set the stage for women remembering their births with the best possible memories, even if complications develop and medical interventions are needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparation-for-labor-and-childbirth/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Coping with pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pain associated with childbirth is a concern of most pregnant women; although interestingly, pain and pain relief do not play a major role in a woman's satisfaction with her childbirth experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparation-for-labor-and-childbirth/abstract/3,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,18</a>]. Childbirth education helps women understand the role pain plays in normal labor and birth: bringing support, protecting the birth canal, ensuring high levels of endorphins and oxytocin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparation-for-labor-and-childbirth/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Women learn that actively working with pain, rather than eliminating it entirely, can facilitate the progress of labor. Women are encouraged to actively respond to their contractions during the first stage of labor, and to push when they feel the urge during second stage (physiologic pushing). Childbirth education addresses modifiable factors that help alleviate labor pain and enhance women's self-confidence. Such factors include controlling the labor and birth environment so that women feel safe and able to find comfort in a variety of ways, coping strategies, and addressing expectations and anxiety about the birth experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparation-for-labor-and-childbirth/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. If women are actively able to work with their contractions in labor they experience a sense of accomplishment, feel less pain, and do not suffer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">WHAT WOMEN NEED TO KNOW</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evidence-based care practices that promote, protect and support normal birth provide the foundation for essential content in a childbirth preparation course [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparation-for-labor-and-childbirth/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>].

The number of visits to the labor suite that resulted in the patient being discharged undelivered was lower in women who received the educational intervention.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Less use of epidural anesthesia: A program that randomly assigned 1193 nulliparous women to receive nine hours of formal childbirth education or usual care found that the women who received comprehensive childbirth education were more likely to be admitted in active labor and less likely to use epidural anesthesia than the usual care group, but medical interventions and patient satisfaction with the childbirth experience were similar in both groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparation-for-labor-and-childbirth/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Almost 50 percent of the usual care group also received some type of childbirth education.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A trial that randomly assigned 176 pregnant Australian women to standard care plus a two-day antenatal class that included complementary medicine techniques or standard care alone reported reduced epidural use for women who received complementary medicine education (epidural use rate: 24 verus 69 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparation-for-labor-and-childbirth/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Women in the treatment group also had reduced rates of labor augmentation, cesarean delivery, and neonatal resuscitation. Of note, in the United States, childbirth education classes include many, if not all, of the activities listed as complementary in the intervention group in this study (visualization and relaxation, breathing, meditation, yoga, acupressure, and facilitated partner support).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduction in elective inductions: Elective induction rates were compared between class attendees and non-attendees, before and after standardized content about the potential risks of elective labor induction was added to prepared childbirth classes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparation-for-labor-and-childbirth/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The nulliparous women who attended classes that included the standardized content were significantly less likely to be induced and less likely to select induction when offered the option compared with non-attendees. Prior to the education intervention, the induction rates were similar for both attendees and non-attendees.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increase in breastfeeding rates: Another randomized trial showed that low income black women who received information on the myths, problems, and benefits of breastfeeding were more likely to breastfeed their infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparation-for-labor-and-childbirth/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p>The purpose of antenatal education is to help prospective parents prepare for childbirth and parenthood by providing information on issues such as evidence-based maternity care practices, pain relief, decision making during labor, infant and postnatal care, and breastfeeding, as well as increasing maternal confidence. However, there is a lack of high-quality evidence from controlled trials to assess the results of antenatal education or determine the best approach, especially since few women are willing to be randomized to no formal antenatal preparation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparation-for-labor-and-childbirth/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. While organizations have espoused the value of childbirth education in both reducing the primary cesarean rate and limiting interventions in labor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparation-for-labor-and-childbirth/abstract/28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">28-30</a>], further research is required to ensure that childbirth education classes best meet the needs of parents and their newborn infants and to determine if evidence based childbirth education plays a role in reducing the primary cesarean rate and limiting interventions in labor and childbirth.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Support during labor and delivery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of an individual supporting the laboring woman appears to have both psychological and medical benefits. A 2017 meta-analysis of 27 trials including over 15,500 women found the continuous presence of a support person reduced the likelihood of medication for pain relief, operative vaginal delivery, cesarean delivery, and the reporting of dissatisfaction with the birth experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparation-for-labor-and-childbirth/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Continuous support was also associated with a slight reduction in the length of labor and improvement in maternal satisfaction (eg, coping during labor, level of personal control during childbirth). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=continuous-labor-support-by-a-doula\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Continuous labor support by a doula&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A home-like birth environment also has beneficial effects. Another Cochrane review found that low risk women giving birth in this setting used less analgesia, had fewer operative deliveries, and were more satisfied with their birth experience and more likely to be breastfeeding two months postpartum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparation-for-labor-and-childbirth/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. They also used less epidural analgesia and had less oxytocin augmentation and fewer episiotomies. However, increased support from caregivers typical of this setting may be an important factor affecting outcome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">WHAT TO DO TO PREPARE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Much of the preparation for labor and birth happens quite naturally as pregnancy progresses. Mother becomes attached to her baby as he makes his presence known with kicks and movement. Physical changes occur: the cervix softens, contractions become noticeable. She begins to tire of being pregnant and often gets a burst of energy right before going into labor (&quot;nesting&quot;). Knowledge of the physiologic changes that indicate her body is preparing for labor and birth helps women develop confidence.</p><p>Another way that prospective mothers prepare for labor and birth is by talking with other women, sharing stories, and getting guidance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparation-for-labor-and-childbirth/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. This helps to foster feelings of connection with other women who have experienced labor and birth, and provides valuable information about ways that women manage the challenges of labor, birth, and early parenting.</p><p>Being present at births or viewing birth on video also help prepare women for their own births. There are a number of excellent videos (many in DVD format) available in which women give birth confidently in a variety of settings. Everyday Miracles is an excellent, short DVD that is available for free viewing on the Lamaze International website [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparation-for-labor-and-childbirth/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>There are literally hundreds of books about pregnancy and birth, and an ever-increasing number of websites that contain information about pregnancy, labor, birth, and early parenting. However, in spite of the wealth of information that is available, many resources contain inaccuracies and increase women's fears about labor and birth.

In the last trimester, most women find formal childbirth education classes a good way to prepare for birth. It is an opportunity to meet with other pregnant women; share stories; obtain knowledge about pregnancy, labor, birth and postpartum issues; devote time to focusing on preparing for birth; and address fears and concerns. Fear of childbirth has been associated with longer labor duration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparation-for-labor-and-childbirth/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Formal childbirth education not only helps women know what to expect during labor and birth, but provides a forum for ultimately making choices within the context of modern maternity care and developing a personal plan for birth (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Birth plans'</a> below).</p><p>The term &lsquo;natural childbirth&rsquo; is sometimes used to describe a method of childbirth where medical intervention for management of pain or labor is minimized. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists&rsquo; Approaches to Limit Interventions in Labor and Birth suggests a number of strategies that are an integral part of childbirth education classes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparation-for-labor-and-childbirth/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. There are various methods of natural childbirth, which can be confusing. Some of the more common approaches are summarized below. It is important to know that over time the distinctions between &quot;methods&quot; have blurred.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grantly Dick-Read told women that childbirth is not an inherently painful event. He described a &quot;fear-tension-pain&quot; syndrome in which fear produced tension in the myometrium leading to pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparation-for-labor-and-childbirth/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. He designed an educational program to minimize fear and thus diminish the fear-tension-pain cycle and also an exercise regimen to prepare women for the exertion of labor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fernand Lamaze combined the concepts of (1) <span class=\"nowrap\">preparation/education</span> to reduce fear and (2) conditioning to diminish the pain reflex (psychoprophylaxis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparation-for-labor-and-childbirth/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. The key features of the Lamaze method were controlled deep breathing, light massage, concentrating on a focal point, active support by a labor coach, and the woman's control over her body and labor management.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Contemporary Lamaze is quite different. The cornerstone of Lamaze preparation is a philosophy that affirms: birth as normal and natural, women's inherent ability to give birth, the importance of birth in women's lives, and the effect of the health care provider and place of birth on women's birth experiences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparation-for-labor-and-childbirth/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Breathing is only one of many comfort strategies taught in Lamaze classes. Women in Lamaze classes are now encouraged to work with their labors, finding comfort in response to their contractions, and pushing in response to the urge to push, rather than controlling their bodies. The focus of classes is helping women have the safest, healthiest birth possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparation-for-labor-and-childbirth/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Robert Bradley gave the woman's partner an active, major role (ie, husband-coached childbirth) and emphasized an extremely natural approach, with few or no drugs and little medical intervention during labor and delivery.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Frederick LeBoyer proposed reducing stimuli that could affect the baby by turning down the lights, speaking quietly, giving a warm bath, and stressing gentleness. These actions are directed at the newborn, rather than support of the mother. The importance of keeping mother and baby together, addressed by LeBoyer, has been incorporated into all childbirth education approaches.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Balaskas introduced the term &quot;active birth&quot; to describe an approach that helped mothers identify and develop their own bodily resources for birth and thus empower them through the birth experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparation-for-labor-and-childbirth/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Active birth reflects the growing knowledge we have of normal, natural birth and the ways in which it is facilitated. It is an important component of both Lamaze and Bradley.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypnobirthing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparation-for-labor-and-childbirth/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>] is based on the belief that when a woman is prepared physically, mentally, and spiritually, she can experience the joy of birth in an easier, more relaxed, and potentially pain free manner. Self-hypnosis and deep relaxation are important components of the method, but it, like other approaches, is eclectic and incorporates many other ways to find comfort and be confident in labor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mindful Birthing , developed by Nancy Berdake, is an adaptation of mindfulness-based stress reduction and incorporates meditation, yoga, and mindfulness into childbirth education [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparation-for-labor-and-childbirth/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Birth plans</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preparing for labor and birth involves creating a plan for assuring that the three things that help women cope with labor and birth are in place: confidence in herself, freedom to reduce discomfort in a variety of ways, and support of family, friends and professionals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparation-for-labor-and-childbirth/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. In the birth plan, the woman identifies what is important to her and what she needs to feel safe, supported and confident in labor. The birth plan is intended to be a living document that changes as circumstances change, acknowledging that medical interventions based on best evidence may be necessary if complications ensue. The strategies she develops to meet her goals will be different depending on her personal preferences, and where she will give birth (eg, hospital, birthing center, home). The birth plan should also include plans for early breastfeeding and the first minutes, days, and weeks of mothering.</p><p>The written birth plan serves several purposes:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It provides an opportunity for discussion between the woman and her partner or support team, as well as between the health care provider and the woman to ensure that all important issues are addressed. The provider and the support team learn what is personally important for the woman.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It helps women become actively involved in making decisions, an important component of childbirth satisfaction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It provides a framework for developing a collaborative relationship between the health care provider and the woman. In some instances, it helps in resolving inconsistencies between the woman's expectations and what is considered best practice (for instance, if she has an epidural, she will need an intravenous line). It helps care providers (including nurses) to know the woman in a more personal way.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It serves as documentation of the agreement between the provider and woman acknowledging that circumstances can change.</p><p/><p>Ideally, written birth plans reduce conflicts and misunderstandings between women and their providers surrounding the birth by making agreements in advance about what will be done in a normal delivery and what will be necessary if an emergency arises. Typically, the written birth plan covers items listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F79039\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79039 \">table 1</a>). Unless there is a serious medical necessity, the birth plan and women's personal preferences should be honored.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN A PREPARATION FOR CHILDBIRTH CLASS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Formal childbirth preparation classes should be taught by a certified childbirth educator [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparation-for-labor-and-childbirth/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. The knowledge and skills of the childbirth educator are different than the nurse's, the teacher's, and other health care professionals, although there is some overlap. The childbirth educator is knowledgeable about the normal, natural process of birth, including strategies to facilitate labor and birth. She is up to date with the most current research about birth and maternity care practices. In addition, she is a skilled teacher who does not just give the facts, but helps women make sense of what they are learning so they can ultimately make informed decisions about their labor and birth.</p><p>There are a number of organizations that provide education <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> certification for childbirth education, although Lamaze is the only program accredited by NCCA, the national accreditation body for certifying agencies. The requirements of each program vary dramatically. No matter which group trains or certifies the childbirth educator, she should be knowledgeable about normal, natural birth, be familiar with the most current research about birth and maternity care practices, and be skilled at teaching groups.</p><p>Childbirth classes should be small, with no more than eight to ten couples, to facilitate discussion and allow for individualized instruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparation-for-labor-and-childbirth/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. In general, classes should involve at least twelve hours of instruction.

Helping women work through fears and develop confidence takes time, therefore, whether classes start early in pregnancy, are taught over a period of weeks or months, or during one long day, it is critical that there be adequate time for practice and discussion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/preparation-for-labor-and-childbirth/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Class content at a very minimum should include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The normal, natural physiologic process of birth including the role of hormones during pregnancy, birth, and breastfeeding</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The care practices that promote, protect and support normal birth, including letting labor start on its own</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The history of birth</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The role of pain, including using pain as a guide to finding comfort in labor</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A wide variety of comfort measures, including not only simple relaxation and breathing techniques, but position changes such as walking and rocking, massage, hydrotherapy, aroma-therapy, music, use of hot and cold</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The importance of support, including a discussion of the value of professional labor support</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ways to facilitate the progress of labor, such as ambulation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indications for medical interventions</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The effect of interventions, including the epidural, on the normal course of labor and birth</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Strategies to minimize the influence of interventions</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complications of the normal, natural process of labor and birth</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How to keep labor as normal as possible if interventions are required</p><p/><p>Content should also include basic information about the importance of keeping mother and baby together, breastfeeding for mother and baby, and infant needs and capabilities, including early infant feeding cues and initial attachment of the baby to the breast.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &ldquo;The Basics&rdquo; and &ldquo;Beyond the Basics.&rdquo; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The goals of childbirth education are to enable women to labor and give birth confidently, comfortably, and supported by the people around them. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Goals of preparation for labor and birth'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Childbirth education helps prospective parents prepare for childbirth and parenthood by providing information on issues such as maternity care practices, pain relief, decision making during labor, infant and postnatal care, and breastfeeding. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'What women need to know'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'What to do to prepare'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Childbirth education classes are a good way to prepare for birth. They provide an opportunity to meet with other pregnant women, share stories, obtain knowledge about <span class=\"nowrap\">pregnancy/labor/birth/postpartum</span> issues, address fears and concerns, and devote time to focusing on preparing for birth. This information helps women know what to expect during labor and birth, and provides a forum for ultimately making choices within the context of modern maternity care and developing a personal plan for birth. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Childbirth education'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Typically, a written birth plan covers items listed in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F79039\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79039 \">table 1</a>).
