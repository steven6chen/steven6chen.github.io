The majority of patients with chronic stable angina are treated with medical therapy, but there are a variety of indications for coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG) or percutaneous coronary intervention.

However, the risk is highly dependent upon comorbid disease, postoperative complications, and the hospital volume of CABG procedures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-mortality-after-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>]. Patients who undergo CABG at low volume centers are more likely to be at high risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-mortality-after-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], while patients who undergo CABG at high volume centers are more likely to be at low risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-mortality-after-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>These mortality rates are probably not applicable to all countries. This was illustrated in a report from the National Health Service in Brazil in which the perioperative mortality was 7.0 percent in almost 66,000 CABG procedures performed between 2000 and 2003 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-mortality-after-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Possible contributors to this increase in risk are bias (some of the American registries are voluntary and therefore may underestimate events) and a greater number of cases performed in low-volume hospitals. The difference in outcomes may affect clinical decision making on the indications for CABG.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PREDICTORS OF RISK</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of preoperative and intraoperative factors have been demonstrated to influence the rate of operative mortality after coronary artery bypass graft surgery (CABG).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Risk prediction algorithms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most effective way of stratifying cardiac surgical patients according to operative risk is to use one of several available risk prediction algorithms that incorporate multiple variables to derive a risk score. One of the most widely used algorithms for this purpose in the United States is that developed by the Society of Thoracic Surgeons (STS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-mortality-after-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. This algorithm, which incorporates patient age, sex, and variables reflecting comorbidities as well as the severity and acuity of cardiac disease, is proprietary and available only to institutions participating in the STS database [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-mortality-after-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Another such algorithm, the EuroSCORE (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F82521\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82521 \">table 1</a>), is widely used in Europe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-mortality-after-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>], is available and has been validated in a North American population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-mortality-after-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>One analysis compared the performance of the STS algorithm and the EuroSCORE in predicting the survival of 4497 patients undergoing isolated CABG between 1996 and 2001 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-mortality-after-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Overall 30-day mortality was 1.9 percent and was accurately predicted by both risk scores. Within individual deciles of risk, both scores performed well, but the EuroSCORE had significantly greater discriminatory power.</p><p>A variety of other algorithms are also available for patients undergoing CABG. In a review of 19 such algorithms in 4351 patients undergoing isolated CABG, EuroSCORE had the highest discriminatory power for both 30-day and one-year mortality, followed by algorithms from New York State and the Cleveland Clinic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-mortality-after-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Limitations of the models</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The principle limitation of these risk prediction algorithms is that they may not be applicable to patient populations, which differ in one or more significant ways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-mortality-after-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. As the patient population changes and as surgical technique changes, risk analyses can become outdated. Thus, the greater discriminatory power of the EuroSCORE in the above analysis may derive, at least in part, from the fact that the patient data upon which it is based were collected in 1995, while those upon which the STS algorithm is based were collected from 1990 to 1993. The STS continues to gather new data to permit progressive algorithm revision.</p><p>Another example of this limitation is that currently, most patients referred for CABG undergo an elective procedure, but that the risk models discussed above were derived from patients who underwent both elective and <span class=\"nowrap\">urgent/emergent</span> procedures. The ACEF (Age, Creatinine, Ejection fraction) score was derived to address this issue, as it included only three variables and was developed from a population of individuals who underwent elective open heart surgery at a single institution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-mortality-after-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. ACEF was able to predict mortality as well as or better than five other more complex risk scores such as EUROSCORE or the Cleveland Clinic model.</p><p>A related limitation is that, as many patients are candidates for either CABG or percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), a simple, bedside risk prediction model that could be applied to either procedure would be useful. The Mayo Clinic Risk Score (MCRS), which uses seven preprocedural variables, is the first such model. It was initially validated in a population of patients scheduled to undergo PCI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-mortality-after-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=periprocedural-complications-of-percutaneous-coronary-intervention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Periprocedural complications of percutaneous coronary intervention&quot;</a>.)</p><p>When tested in over 300,000 patients scheduled to undergo isolated CABG surgery in the STS database, there was moderate positive correlation between MCRS and the observed in-hospital mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-mortality-after-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. When compared to the 26 variable STS algorithm, performance was inferior.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Hospital and surgeon experience</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The in-hospital mortality after CABG is related to the volume of CABG procedures performed at the hospital, as illustrated by the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In an analysis of over 900,000 CABG procedures in the Medicare database between 1994 and 1999, the adjusted in-hospital or 30-day mortality was inversely related to hospital volume, ranging from 6.1 percent for hospitals performing &lt;230 procedures per year to 4.8 percent when the volume was &gt;849 procedures per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-mortality-after-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a report on over 200,000 procedures from the STS National Cardiac Database between January 2000 and December 2001, the overall operative mortality was 2.7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-mortality-after-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The mortality rate ranged from 3.5 percent for hospitals performing &le;150 procedures per year to 2.4 percent for hospitals performing &gt;450 procedures per year.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar observations have been made in Brazil where a report from the National Health Service for all types of cardiac surgery noted a progressive increase in perioperative mortality from 5.8 percent in hospitals performing more than 341 procedures per year (highest quartile) to 9.7 percent in hospitals performing less than 131 procedures per year (lowest quartile) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-mortality-after-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p>The association between volume and operative mortality may depend upon patient risk status:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the STS database report, adjustment for clinical risk, year of surgery, and patient clustering within centers reduced the impact of annual hospital volume on mortality, with an adjusted mortality range from 3.1 percent (&le;150 procedures) to 2.4 percent (&gt;450 procedures) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-mortality-after-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. For patients under 65 years and for those estimated to be at low operative risk, there was no association of hospital volume with mortality.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar findings were noted in a review of 13,644 patients seen in hospitals performing a low (&lt;200) or high (&gt;200) number of procedures per year: Four established predictors (age, gender, surgical priority, and severity of illness) were used to classify risk status (minimal, low, moderate, high, and severe) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-mortality-after-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. In-hospital mortality in low-volume hospitals was significantly higher in patients at moderate risk (5.3 versus 2.2 percent for high-volume hospitals) and high risk (23 versus 12 percent); there was no difference in mortality in the other risk groups.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A different conclusion, however, was reached in an analysis of 57,150 CABG operations performed in New York State between 1997 and 1999; there were 1260 (2.2 percent) in-hospital deaths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-mortality-after-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. A logistic regression model was used to classify patient risk as low (predicted in-hospital mortality &lt;2 percent) or moderate to high (predicted in-hospital mortality &ge;2 percent). When low-volume hospitals were defined as those performing fewer than 200 operations per year, the odds of in-hospital death were lower at the high-volume hospitals for both low- and moderate- to high-risk patients (adjusted odds ratios 0.53 and 0.62, respectively). The advantage of high-volume hospitals persisted when the definition of low volume was changed to less than 600 operations per year.</p><p/><p>The experience of the individual surgeon is a predictor of mortality independent of the hospital volume:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a study of over 200,000 CABG procedures in the Medicare database from 1998 and 1999, operative mortality rates for surgeons performing &lt;101, 101 to 162, and &gt;162 CABGs per year were 5.4, 4.3, and 4.0 percent, respectively (odds ratio 1.36). This relationship remained significant after adjusting for hospital volume (odds ratio 1.33).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the STS database analysis, surgeon volume was also a determinant of risk-adjusted mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-mortality-after-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Surgeons performing 10 to 85, 86 to 138, and &ge;139 CABG procedures annually had overall mortality rates of 2.9, 2.6, and 2.4 percent, respectively. The highest mortality rates (3.3 percent) were observed when patients were treated by low-volume surgeons at low-volume hospitals.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the New York State study, surgeon volume was also a determinant of mortality for both low- and moderate- to high-risk patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-mortality-after-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. For low-risk patients, either high surgeon volume or high hospital volume or both significantly reduced in-hospital mortality. For moderate- to high-risk patients, only the combination of both high surgeon volume and high hospital volume was associated with a significant reduction in risk.</p><p/><p>Hospital volume and the experience of the surgeon also affect the likelihood of early readmission after CABG.

In a prospective observational study of over 8600 patients undergoing CABG between 1992 and 1997, the operative mortality varied from less than 2 percent with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) &gt;40 percent to 3.5 to 4 percent with an LVEF between 20 and 40 percent to approximately 8 percent with an LVEF &lt;20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-mortality-after-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Increasing age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Not surprisingly, older age is a predictor of increased risk after CABG (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F77573\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77573 \">figure 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-mortality-after-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/22,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,24</a>]. This is an important issue since an increasing number of elderly patients (&ge;70 years of age) are undergoing CABG.</p><p>One report retrospectively reviewed the outcome of 3330 patients over the age of 70 in whom isolated CABG was performed between 1982 and 1996 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-mortality-after-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The overall operative mortality decreased from 7.2 to 4.4 percent over the course of the study. The prevalence of high-risk elderly patients rose from 16.2 to 26.9 percent, but the operative mortality in these individuals fell from 17.2 to 8.9 percent. Independent predictors of mortality in older adults were similar to those of younger patients and included poor left ventricular function, previous CABG, female sex, peripheral artery disease, and diabetes.</p><p>A later report evaluated the outcome of 725 patients &ge;80 years of age who underwent CABG between 1996 and 2001 in Canadian centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/operative-mortality-after-coronary-artery-bypass-graft-surgery/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. By 2001, 6.2 percent of bypass operations were performed in octogenarians.
