The endoscopic placement of SEMS is especially advantageous compared with radiologic placement when the obstruction is proximal to the recto-sigmoid region or in the presence of a tortuous colon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enteral-stents-for-the-management-of-malignant-colorectal-obstruction/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>During colonoscopy, judicious insufflation should be used to minimize the risk of perforation due to a closed-loop phenomenon between the obstructing lesion and the ileocecal valve. Carbon dioxide insufflation has largely supplanted room air insufflation for all endoscopic procedures, especially high-risk cases such as these. Water immersion colonoscopy is another technique which could be utilized to minimize bowel distention when colonoscopy with carbon dioxide insufflation is unsuccessful.

The guidewire is placed through the stricture and advanced beyond the level of the stricture. Guidewire placement is confirmed with injection of contrast under fluoroscopy. The stent is then passed over the guidewire until the tip is proximal to (ie, above) the tumor. The stent is then deployed under fluoroscopic guidance and with endoscopic visualization of the stent&rsquo;s distal position (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F113148\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef113148 \">picture 2</a>).

If either end of the stent is not flared or expanded to produce a waist, the stent may be too short to traverse the stricture.

Perforation can be immediate or delayed, and is more likely in the distal colon where sharp angulation and redundancy make stent deployment challenging. Furthermore, the anatomy of the left colon predisposes the colonic folds to drape over the two ends of the stent, which can cause excessive tension at the points of contact, and subsequent pressure necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enteral-stents-for-the-management-of-malignant-colorectal-obstruction/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>In a systematic review of SEMS for malignant colonic obstruction, the median perforation rate was 4.5 percent with a range from 0 to 83 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enteral-stents-for-the-management-of-malignant-colorectal-obstruction/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

Stent migration is usually detected within one week of insertion, but can occur later.

This may require placement of an additional stent within the original stent. Alternatives include endoscopic treatment with laser ablation (uncommonly used and not readily available in most endoscopy units), or argon plasma coagulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enteral-stents-for-the-management-of-malignant-colorectal-obstruction/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].

Minor rectal bleeding generally requires no treatment. Delayed bleeding may be due to ulcerations or erosions in the colonic mucosa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enteral-stents-for-the-management-of-malignant-colorectal-obstruction/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2283756547\"><span class=\"h2\">Pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transient and mild abdominal pain is common and may be felt up to five days after stenting. Mild abdominal pain generally requires no specific treatment other than the judicious use of analgesics. We prescribe non-narcotic analgesics, as needed. However, stent expansion occurs over 48 to 72 hours, which can be painful, and may require narcotic analgesics.</p><p>Although SEMS placement most often treats obstruction due to left-sided lesions that are at least 5 cm proximal to the anal verge, successful stent placement within 5 cm of the anal verge has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/enteral-stents-for-the-management-of-malignant-colorectal-obstruction/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

We agree with the guidelines that suggest that colonic stenting should be avoided in patients who are or will be receiving anti-angiogenic agents (eg, bevacizumab), especially if the obstruction is subtotal.

For patients with partial obstruction in the distal colon, two cleansing tap water enemas are generally sufficient. For patients with partial obstruction from a proximal lesion, an oral bowel prep can be attempted and discontinued if symptoms such as abdominal pain, abdominal distension, nausea, or emesis develop.
