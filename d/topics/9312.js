IPV can affect anyone, but women are more often victims than men. Lifetime estimates for IPV involving women in the United States range from 22 to 39 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-diagnosis-and-screening/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>]. In countries around the world, 10 to 69 percent of women report physical assault by an intimate partner at some time in their life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-diagnosis-and-screening/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The term &quot;intimate partner violence&quot; describes actual or threatened psychological, physical, or sexual harm by a current or former partner or spouse. IPV can occur among heterosexual or same-sex couples and does not require sexual intimacy.</p><p>All too frequently, IPV is undiagnosed since patients often conceal that they are in abusive relationships. The clues pointing to abuse may be subtle or absent. Many groups advocate screening all patients, or all female patients, for IPV.</p><p>This topic will discuss the clinical presentation and diagnosis of IPV and issues related to population screening with recommendations of various groups. The epidemiology and health consequences of IPV and management of patients in whom IPV is identified are discussed separately. Elder mistreatment is also addressed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intimate-partner-violence-intervention-and-patient-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intimate partner violence: Intervention and patient management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intimate-partner-violence-epidemiology-and-health-consequences\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intimate partner violence: Epidemiology and health consequences&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=elder-mistreatment-abuse-neglect-and-financial-exploitation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Elder mistreatment: Abuse, neglect, and financial exploitation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8920150\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Victims of intimate partner violence (IPV) are found among people of all ages, socioeconomic classes, ethnicities, gender identities, and sexual preferences. While certain risk factors have been identified (younger age, female, lower socioeconomic status, family history or personal history of violence), IPV should be considered in all patients who present with a history or findings consistent with undisclosed violence. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intimate-partner-violence-epidemiology-and-health-consequences\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intimate partner violence: Epidemiology and health consequences&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Certain aspects of the history or observations made during the clinical encounter should heighten the clinician's suspicion of IPV. These include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-diagnosis-and-screening/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An inconsistent explanation of injuries.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Delay in seeking treatment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Frequent emergency department or urgent visits. Typically abusers do not want their victims to form an ongoing allegiance with one clinician. They may feel the victim will be less likely to find an ally in an emergency department where care may be more fragmented.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Missed appointments. The patient may not keep appointments because the abuser will not allow medical attention. In one study, 17 percent of victims of IPV felt that their partner interfered with their access to practitioner visits, compared with 2 percent of those not suffering from abuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-diagnosis-and-screening/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In pregnancy, late initiation of prenatal care.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Repeated abortions.

The clinician should be suspicious if the partner is overly solicitous or answers questions for the patient.

Although confounding issues may account for some of the observed associations, violence is associated with difficulty in ambulation, difficulty with daily activities, memory loss, dizziness, emotional distress, and pelvic complaints.</p><p>Gynecologic conditions that are seen more frequently in abused patients include premenstrual syndrome, sexually transmitted diseases including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, unintended pregnancy (via reproductive coercion) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-diagnosis-and-screening/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], and chronic pelvic pain.

Any injury without a good explanation, particularly involving the head and neck, teeth, or genital area, should raise suspicion. Typically, the victim of domestic violence sustains injuries on the central part of the body such as the breasts, abdomen, and genitals. Wounds on the head and neck, particularly neck bruising, may arise from attempted strangulation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F86280\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef86280 \">picture 1</a>). Wounds on the forearms often occur when a victim is in a defensive position.

This is to be distinguished from a screening evaluation, which involves questioning all patients who are seen for care, regardless of whether they present with a history or examination that raises concerns about possible abuse.</p><p>Routinely asking about IPV significantly increases its detection in certain clinical situations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F53373\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53373 \">table 1</a>). In one study, for example, 5.6 percent of 359 female trauma victims were identified as having injuries due to IPV before institution of a screening protocol in the emergency department, compared with 30 percent of 412 patients following use of the protocol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-diagnosis-and-screening/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8920187\"><span class=\"h2\">General principles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The setting in which questioning occurs is important. The clinician must assure that the patient feels safe and comfortable. Clinicians should not display hesitancy, judgment, or discomfort, and they should avoid using the phrases &quot;domestic violence&quot; or &quot;victim&quot; but rather should ask about being hurt or experiencing violence.</p><p>Patients are more likely to disclose their experience of violence when [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-diagnosis-and-screening/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Practitioners are ready to listen and use open-ended questioning.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Questioning is done in privacy.

One qualitative study found that women did not want to be counseled in a directive way to leave their relationship, go to a shelter, or be told they would be reported to the police [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-diagnosis-and-screening/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

Patients who have been involved with IPV are likely to be extremely vulnerable and may misinterpret the practitioner's best intentions. The Massachusetts Medical Society has proposed the following caveats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-diagnosis-and-screening/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid using terms like &quot;victim,&quot; &quot;abused,&quot; or &quot;battered.&quot; Instead, mirror the patient's own word choices or use words like &quot;hurt,&quot; &quot;frightened,&quot; or &quot;treated badly.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not inquire about abuse in the presence of the partner, friends, or family members.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not disclose or discuss your concerns with the patient's partner.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not ask the patient what he or she did to bring on the abuse.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not ask why the patient has not left the partner, or why they may have returned to the batterer.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1620205\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient denial</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abused patients may deny the abuse for several reasons. They may not be emotionally ready to admit the reality of the situation; they may blame themselves, or feel like a failure if they admit to being abused. They may fear rejection by the clinician, be ashamed, believe that the abuse will not happen again, fear reprisal by the abuser, believe that they have no alternatives, or lack knowledge of resources that could help. There may be language or cultural barriers between clinicians and patients that interfere with communication, and discomfort with using an interpreter to discuss sensitive issues.</p><p>Patients for whom IPV is suspected but not acknowledged should be asked again at subsequent visits. There are some data to suggest that patients are more likely to disclose information after they have been asked about violence repeatedly in the health care setting, thereby normalizing inquiry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-diagnosis-and-screening/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8920202\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS AND SCREENING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many tools have been proposed to detect or screen for intimate partner violence (IPV) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-diagnosis-and-screening/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

In addition, we suggest inquiring about IPV on visits to the emergency department and on hospital admissions.</p><p>IPV is widely prevalent and is often longstanding prior to diagnosis. Identifying patients who are exposed to violence provides clinicians with insight in order to appropriately address medical problems that may be sequelae of violence and to intervene to prevent bodily harm. Educating patients about violence by making it a part of the medical conversation may make it more likely for reticent patients to disclose at a subsequent visit. It also sends a message about prevention to victims and perpetrators by heightening awareness that practitioners feel this behavior is wrong and that they are willing and able to assist.</p><p>Any of the short questions discussed above would be appropriate for screening.

A systematic review of eight randomized trials evaluating the effect of screening for IPV in health care settings found that, compared with usual care, screening increases the identification of women experiencing IPV (odds ratio [OR] 2.95, 95% CI 1.8-4.9), particularly for pregnant women (OR 4.5, 95% CI 1.8-11.3) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-diagnosis-and-screening/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>However, most studies have not shown that screening improved health outcomes for the abused or the perpetrator [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-diagnosis-and-screening/abstract/35,39-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,39-42</a>]. Evidence for the impact of screening for IPV on patient outcomes is limited by methodologic and ethical challenges. These include the inability to withhold intervention from control group participants identified with IPV, reliance on self-reported measures, lack of a reference standard, a high loss to follow-up among this patient population, and inability to conduct a double-blind trial. The results of a meta-analysis of 11 randomized or quasi-randomized studies, including more than 13,000 patients, suggest that screening increases identification of IPV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-diagnosis-and-screening/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. However, the included studies did not show that screening leads to long-term benefits except possibly in antenatal populations. A previously reported systematic review by the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) found similar results but concluded that screening should be recommended because the limitations of the studies did not rule out a potential benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-diagnosis-and-screening/abstract/2,43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,43,44</a>].</p><p>No adverse effects of screening and intervention for IPV were identified in two of three trials that included adverse effects as on outcome event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-diagnosis-and-screening/abstract/39,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,45</a>].

Discomfort with screening was greatest among women who experienced physical or sexual violence related to IPV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-diagnosis-and-screening/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Concerns raised by survey respondents included loss of privacy, worries about provoking abuse with disclosure, emotional distress, fear of judgment by the practitioner, and disappointment in the practitioner's response. This highlights the fear and sensitivity of victims of abuse and the need for assuring safety and support with screening.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H623583255\"><span class=\"h3\">Barriers to implementation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both practitioners and patients have expressed discomfort with screening for IPV. Though many national groups have recommended screening, rates of screening in primary care settings have been low (less than 13 percent in one internal medicine clinic) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-diagnosis-and-screening/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p>Barriers for clinicians to screen for IPV have been identified and categorized in five areas in one systematic review: personal barriers, resource barriers, perceptions and attitudes, fears, and patient-related barriers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-diagnosis-and-screening/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. The most frequent barriers were personal discomfort, lack of knowledge, and time constraints. Other issues underlying clinician reluctance to integrate routine screening into practice include uncertainty regarding how to help if IPV is identified and privacy, legal, and personal safety concerns. One study noted more discomfort among male clinicians, and those in private practice, with less discomfort for gynecologists, hospital-based practices, and practitioners who have been in practice for 5 to 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-diagnosis-and-screening/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p>A systems model approach can improve screening uptake and patient referral for services [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-diagnosis-and-screening/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>]. This may involve staff training including medical and mental health clinicians as well as social workers, providing materials for distribution to female patients, implementing computer-based or other self-administered screening tools, alerts or prompts on patient charts for practitioners to inquire about IPV and follow-up when IPV is identified, and identifying community resources for referral and working with community advocates.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2207911876\"><span class=\"h2\">Pregnancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Screening for IPV is a recommended part of prenatal care. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) advises that all women be screened for IPV at periodic intervals, including during obstetric care (at the first prenatal visit, at least once per trimester, and at the postpartum checkup) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-diagnosis-and-screening/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].

The guideline recommends that clinicians screen women of childbearing age (14 to 46 years old) for IPV and provide or refer women to intervention services when appropriate. The guideline is based on a systematic review published in June 2012 on behalf of the USPSTF that found that several instruments detect IPV at a high rate and that screening is associated with minimal harms and many potential benefits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-diagnosis-and-screening/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In a 2004 guideline, citing lack of proven effectiveness for screening instruments and lack of evidence that screening improves clinical outcomes, the USPSTF concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support screening for IPV in asymptomatic populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intimate-partner-violence-diagnosis-and-screening/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].

Practitioners have been skeptical about detecting a problem for which they cannot offer helpful assistance and may grapple with their own discomfort when caring for these patients.</p><p>Many perpetrators also have been victims, further complicating a sensitive issue.

While not all patients experiencing IPV exhibit symptoms or signs, certain features should heighten suspicion of IPV. These include inconsistent explanation of injuries, delay in seeking treatment or missed appointments, frequent emergency department visits, late prenatal care, inappropriate affect, overly attentive partners, and reluctance to be examined. IPV is associated with a perception of overall poor health with somatic (often gynecologic) and psychologic impact. (See <a href=\"#H8920150\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Routinely asking about IPV significantly increases its detection in certain clinical situations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F53373\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53373 \">table 1</a>). In questioning a patient in whom IPV is suspected, practitioners should be cognizant of patient's expectations for nonjudgmental, compassionate listening that allows the patient to progress at their own pace, with shared decision-making, respect for the patient's decisions, and no pressure to disclose, leave the relationship, or press charges. Terms like &quot;victim,&quot; &quot;domestic violence,&quot; &quot;abused,&quot; or &quot;battered&quot; should be avoided. (See <a href=\"#H8920194\" class=\"local\">'Patient expectations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Abused patients may deny the abuse for multiple reasons. Patients for whom IPV is suspected but not acknowledged should be asked again at subsequent visits. (See <a href=\"#H1620205\" class=\"local\">'Patient denial'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Before questioning a patient about abuse, it can be helpful to &quot;normalize&quot; the inquiry and frame the questioning as a routine part of everyday practice. Possible statements include &quot;Violence can be a problem in many people's lives, so I now ask every patient about trauma or abuse they may have experienced in a relationship&quot; or &quot;Many patients I see are coping with an abusive relationship, so I've started asking about intimate partner violence routinely.&quot; (See <a href=\"#H4532982\" class=\"local\">'Framing the inquiry'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several short tools have been developed for use in screening for IPV. Single questions may be sufficient for screening. Self-administered questionnaires, including computer-based assessment tools, may be more effective that face-to-face questioning. (See <a href=\"#H8920209\" class=\"local\">'Short surveys for clinicians'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1620136\" class=\"local\">'Computer-based screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multiple professional organizations endorse screening for IPV but differ in suggested target populations and do not address screening frequency. We suggest routine screening for IPV for all patients on initial visits to primary care clinicians, to obstetrician-gynecologists, to the emergency department, and on hospital admission (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). All pregnant women and patients presenting with concerning symptoms or signs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F53373\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53373 \">table 1</a>) should be asked about IPV.
