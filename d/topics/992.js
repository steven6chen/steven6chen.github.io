Anterior cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome is one of the most frequent causes of chronic abdominal wall pain. The diagnosis is suspected based on history and physical examination.

In one retrospective study, 2 percent of patients who presented to the emergency room for evaluation of abdominal wall pain had anterior cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anterior-cutaneous-nerve-entrapment-syndrome/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Among patients with abdominal pain and a negative prior diagnostic evaluation, the prevalence of abdominal wall pain ranges from 15 to 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anterior-cutaneous-nerve-entrapment-syndrome/abstract/5,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,9</a>]. Women appear to be four times more likely to have anterior cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome as compared with men. The peak incidence is between the ages of 30 to 50 years, although cases have been reported in children and the elderly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOPATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anterior cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome is caused by entrapment of the cutaneous branches of sensory nerves supplying the abdominal wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anterior-cutaneous-nerve-entrapment-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The cutaneous branches of sensory nerves arising from T7 to T12 make a 90-degree angle as they progress anteriorly through the posterior rectus sheath, passing through a fibrous ring within the lateral border of the rectus abdominis medial to the linea semilunaris. Once the nerves reach the overlying aponeurosis, the nerves divide again at 90-degree angles beneath the skin. Normally, fat in the neurovascular bundle permits the nerve to slide unimpeded within the fibrous ring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anterior-cutaneous-nerve-entrapment-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Entrapment of the nerve can be caused by intra- or extra-abdominal pressure, ischemia, compression by herniation of the fat pad that normally protects it into the fibrous canal surrounding the nerve, or localized scarring. Other mechanical causes of nerve compression such as obesity and tight clothing may also be important in individual cases. Oral contraceptives and pregnancy have been associated with exacerbation of entrapment syndromes, possibly due to tissue edema from estrogen and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progesterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">progesterone</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anterior-cutaneous-nerve-entrapment-syndrome/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anatomy-of-the-abdominal-wall\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anatomy of the abdominal wall&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Pain can usually be localized to a highly discrete region of the abdomen. This can be explained by the characteristics of the nerves causing the pain. There are two kinds of pain receptors: A-delta and C nociceptors. The A-delta nociceptors, comprising up to 25 percent of nociceptors, are found in skin and muscle, and mediate the sharp, sudden pain that is associated with injury such as a cut, trauma, or pain in the abdominal wall. The C type nociceptor (approximately 50 percent of nociceptors) innervates periosteum, parietal peritoneum, and viscera and mediates the dull, difficult to localize pain of intraperitoneal disease. With most causes of intraabdominal pain, localization is therefore difficult and the patient often waves the hand over a relatively wide area of the abdomen. In contrast, when the pain is in the abdominal wall and, therefore, mediated by A-delta nociceptors, the patient usually points to the location with one finger. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-abdominal-pain-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of abdominal pain in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with anterior cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome present with chronic pain and characteristically maximal tenderness over a small area of the abdominal wall (less than 2 cm in diameter). The pain is usually located along the lateral edge of the rectus abdominis muscle sheath and is predominantly located on the right side of the abdomen. However, the pain may be located anywhere on the abdomen and in more than one location. In some patients, the pain is somewhat more diffuse, with radiation throughout the affected dermatome. The pain may be sharp, dull, or burning. Aggravating factors include tensing of abdominal musculature (eg, standing, walking, stretching, laughing, coughing, and sneezing). The pain is positional. It is least in the supine position and exacerbated by sitting or by lying on the affected side. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3287296378\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC APPROACH</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3111540350\"><span class=\"h2\">Overview</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial evaluation should begin with history and physical examination (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F110070\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef110070 \">algorithm 1</a>). Patients with anterior cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome have characteristically well-localized abdominal pain with an increase in tenderness to palpation during muscle tensing. In general, patients with anterior cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome have normal laboratory tests. Immediate relief of abdominal pain with trigger point injection of local anesthetic agents establishes the diagnosis of anterior cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome. We perform an initial trigger point injection combined with local anesthetic and glucocorticoids. (See <a href=\"#H2372637287\" class=\"local\">'Trigger point injection'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients with &quot;red flags&quot; (potentially worrisome features) should be evaluated for other causes of abdominal pain. The lack of improvement with trigger point injection of local anesthetic agents should also prompt evaluation for other etiologies of abdominal pain. The diagnostic approach to abdominal pain is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"#H2075313347\" class=\"local\">'Red flags for additional evaluation'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain#H2233570259\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with abdominal pain&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic approach to chronic abdominal pain'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3217291119\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with anterior cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome are able to point with one finger to the area of maximal tenderness. Voluntary guarding of the affected area may be present on palpation (Hover sign) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anterior-cutaneous-nerve-entrapment-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Hyperesthesia, hyperalgesia, or heightened sensitivity to normally non-painful tactile stimulation (allodynia) of the surrounding skin may be present in up to 75 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anterior-cutaneous-nerve-entrapment-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p>Patients have increased local tenderness during muscle tensing (Carnett&rsquo;s sign) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anterior-cutaneous-nerve-entrapment-syndrome/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. To elicit Carnett&rsquo;s sign, the patient is asked to perform a straight-leg-raising maneuver (raising both legs off the table at the same time while supine) while the examiner&rsquo;s finger is on the painful site. Raising only the head while in the supine position can serve the same purpose. These maneuvers tighten the rectus abdominis muscles, increasing the pain from the entrapped nerve. If the pain is increased or the same, the source of the patient's symptoms is most likely the abdominal wall, and Carnett&rsquo;s sign should be considered positive. If the pain is decreased, the origin of pain is likely from an intra-abdominal organ, as the tensed abdominal wall muscles protect the viscera. Carnett's sign may not be interpretable in patients who cannot comply adequately with leg- or head-raising maneuvers. False positive results may occur from visceral causes of pain that involve the local parietal peritoneum. Other conditions resulting in a positive Carnett's sign are abdominal hernias and slipping rib syndrome. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2075313347\"><span class=\"h2\">Red flags for additional evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of &quot;red flags&quot; (potentially worrisome features) increases the suspicion for other organic causes of abdominal pain and decrease the likelihood of anterior cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome.

Epigastric hernias occur in the midline (except at the umbilicus). Patients may note a small, slightly uncomfortable lump between the umbilicus and the xiphoid. Up to 20 percent of epigastric hernias are multiple. Pain may increase when lying down and a small subcutaneous mass (tag of omentum) may be felt in the linea alba in addition to a defect(s) in the midline. Spigelian hernia occurs along the semilunar line, which is the caudal most extent of the posterior rectus sheath.

Forward angulation caused by anterior compression fractures pushes the ribs onto the pelvis, causing the chest and abdominal pain.

(See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Anesthetic, glucocorticoid injection'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients who do not respond to repeat injection after an initial response should be carefully reassessed for other causes of abdominal pain, paying specific attention to the type of ongoing symptoms, the degree to which symptoms have worsened, and compliance with conservative therapy. Reassessment is also indicated if a patient has a recurrence of symptoms after initial improvement that does not mimic the initial presentation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with abdominal pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In patients with recurrent pain after three re-injections of combined local anesthetic and glucocorticoid in the same site within a year, we perform chemical neurolysis.

In a retrospective study of 154 patients who underwent primary anterior neurectomy, a 50 percent pain reduction in pain intensity was noted in 61 percent of patients at a mean follow-up of 32 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anterior-cutaneous-nerve-entrapment-syndrome/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3435152603\"><span class=\"h2\">Other therapies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and tricyclic antidepressants have been used for in the treatment of musculoskeletal pain but their efficacy in anterior cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome has not been established. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic pain emanating from the abdominal wall is frequently unrecognized, often leading to extensive diagnostic testing before an accurate diagnosis is established. Anterior cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome is one of the most frequent causes of chronic abdominal wall pain. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The estimated incidence of abdominal wall pain is 1 in 1800 individuals. Among patients with abdominal pain and a negative prior diagnostic evaluation, the prevalence of abdominal wall pain ranges from 15 to 30 percent. Women appear to be four times more likely to have anterior cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome as compared with men. The peak incidence is between the ages of 30 to 50 years, although cases have been reported in children and the elderly. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anterior cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome is caused by entrapment of the cutaneous branches of sensory nerves supplying the abdominal wall. Entrapment of the nerve can be caused by intra- or extra-abdominal pressure, ischemia, compression by herniation of the fat pad that normally protects it into the fibrous canal surrounding the nerve, or localized scarring. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Etiopathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain associated with anterior cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome is characteristically maximal in an area less than 2 cm in diameter and often along the lateral aspect of the rectus abdominis muscle sheath. Patients also have increased local tenderness during muscle tensing (positive Carnett&rsquo;s sign). (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of anterior cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome is based on the presence of all of the following (see <a href=\"#H2056035824\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Well-localized abdominal pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Increase in tenderness to palpation during muscle tensing on physical examination (Carnett&rsquo;s sign).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Response to trigger point injection of a local anesthetic agent. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnostic evaluation in patients with suspected anterior cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome aims to establish the diagnosis and to identify patients who should be assessed for causes of abdominal pain. Initial evaluation should begin with history and physical examination (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F110070\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef110070 \">algorithm 1</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Patients with the &quot;red flags&quot; (potentially worrisome features) should be evaluated for other causes of abdominal pain. Red flags for additional evaluation include: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Gastrointestinal bleeding </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Abnormal laboratory studies (eg, unexplained elevation in liver tests, amylase, lipase, tissue transglutaminase antibody, leukocytosis, or iron deficiency)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Change in bowel habits </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Malnutrition</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Abdominal mass</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Signs or symptoms of systemic illness (eg, fever, chills, weight loss)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In general, patients with anterior cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome have normal laboratory tests and do not have worrisome features on initial evaluation. Immediate relief of abdominal pain with trigger point injection of a local anesthetic agent establishes the diagnosis of anterior cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome. We perform an initial trigger point injection with combined local anesthetic and glucocorticoids. Lack of improvement in pain with a trigger point injection should also prompt reevaluation of abdominal pain. (See <a href=\"#H3111540350\" class=\"local\">'Overview'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with anterior cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome, we suggest initial conservative therapy following a diagnostic trigger point injection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F110070\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef110070 \">algorithm 1</a>) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Conservative therapy includes activity modification to avoid exercises that involve tension of the abdominal muscles. (See <a href=\"#H1744681311\" class=\"local\">'Conservative therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In patients with partial improvement or recurrent pain after complete pain relief, we repeat glucocorticoid injections one month after the prior injection. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Anesthetic, glucocorticoid injection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with continued pain despite three re-injections should be carefully reassessed for other causes of abdominal pain, paying specific attention to the type of ongoing symptoms, the degree to which symptoms have improved or worsened, and compliance with conservative therapy. Reassessment is also indicated if a patient has a recurrence of symptoms after initial improvement that does not mimic the initial presentation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-the-adult-with-abdominal-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of the adult with abdominal pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with recurrent pain after three re-injections of combined local anesthetic and glucocorticoid in the same site within a year, we perform neurolysis. (See <a href=\"#H1769353437\" class=\"local\">'Chemical neurolysis'</a> above.) &#160;</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/anterior-cutaneous-nerve-entrapment-syndrome/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Thompson C, Goodman R, Rowe WA, et al.
