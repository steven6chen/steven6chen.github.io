They most frequently occur on the heels and soles of the feet due to friction from shoes and socks during walking or running. Moisture (eg, from sweating) and pressure points typically caused by poor-fitting or new foot wear increases the frictional forces applied to the skin and predisposes to blister formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heel-pain-in-the-active-child-or-skeletally-immature-adolescent-overview-of-causes/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].

Typical objects causing these injuries include nails, pins, other metal objects, wood, stones, and glass. These wounds have a significant risk for infection. When evaluating plantar puncture wounds in children and adolescents the clinician should determine when the injury occurred, whether the patient was barefoot or wearing shoes, and what object caused the wound, if known. The wound should be examined with the patient prone to be able to assess it completely. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infectious-complications-of-puncture-wounds#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infectious complications of puncture wounds&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infectious-complications-of-puncture-wounds#H29291341\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infectious complications of puncture wounds&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Imaging is warranted when there is a clinical suspicion of a retained foreign body. Plain radiographs can detect many radiopaque foreign bodies (eg, glass, stones, or metallic objects). Wood, plastic, and other radiolucent objects can be located with ultrasound. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are also helpful methods of localizing a retained foreign body when plain radiographs or ultrasound fail. MRI cannot be used when metallic objects are present.

Typically, nonabsorbable sutures are used for wound closure and are kept in place for approximately 10 days. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=minor-wound-preparation-and-irrigation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Minor wound preparation and irrigation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=closure-of-minor-skin-wounds-with-sutures\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Closure of minor skin wounds with sutures&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Lacerations to the sole of the foot frequently involve cuts caused by sharp objects that the patient steps on while barefoot and foreign bodies are an important consideration. Imaging is warranted when there is a clinical suspicion of a retained foreign body. Plain radiographs can detect many radiopaque foreign bodies (eg, glass, stones, or metallic objects). Wood, plastic, and other radiolucent objects can be located with ultrasound. CT and MRI are also helpful methods of localizing a retained foreign body when plain radiographs or ultrasound fail. MRI cannot be used when metallic objects are present. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infectious-complications-of-puncture-wounds#H29291341\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infectious complications of puncture wounds&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Relative to wounds on other parts of the body, lacerations on the heel are more painful to anesthetize by local injection. A posterior tibial nerve block provides an alternative approach that may provide better pain control during the procedure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lower-extremity-nerve-blocks-techniques#H1413150773\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lower extremity nerve blocks: Techniques&quot;, section on 'Ankle block'</a>.)</p><p>Lower extremity wounds are more prone to infection than lacerations with better perfusion (eg, face or scalp lacerations). Thus, patients should have a wound check within a few days of wound closure and should be given careful instructions regarding proper wound care, including no swimming, no immersion while bathing, and monitoring for infection.

Examination reveals focal soft tissue tenderness at the plantar surface of the mid portion of the heel (not at the insertion of plantar fascia, which suggests plantar fasciitis). This is where the os calcis is most prominent and thus, at higher risk of contusion.</p><p>The management of heel contusions is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-common-causes-of-foot-pain-in-adults#H1584981\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and diagnosis of common causes of foot pain in adults&quot;, section on 'Heel contusion'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H171105222\"><span class=\"h2\">Calcaneal fracture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical presentation of a calcaneal fracture depends upon its location and the severity of the injury. Most calcaneus fractures result from significant trauma, typically an axial loading of the foot following a fall or jump from a height. Pain is usually quite severe and weightbearing is often impossible. Swelling and tenderness are typically evident, and may be severe. Deformity of the heel may be apparent. The physical examination should include vital signs and a careful evaluation looking for signs of internal injury, particularly for patients involved in high energy trauma (eg, fall from height). Typically, patients with a calcaneus fracture from high energy trauma manifest tenderness around the heel and hindfoot. Areas to palpate include the tuberosity, body, and anterior portions of the calcaneus. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=calcaneus-fractures#H57343593\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Calcaneus fractures&quot;, section on 'Mechanism and clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p>Calcaneal fractures are diagnosed on the basis of imaging studies. Radiographic evaluation of a suspected calcaneus fracture begins with plain radiographs, including lateral and axial views (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F89383\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef89383 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F89295\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef89295 \">image 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F54662\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54662 \">figure 3</a>). Additional views and CT are obtained when clinicians require greater detail about the extent of the fracture or when there is concern for an occult fracture despite nondefinitive initial radiographs. In addition, half of the patients with a calcaneus fracture sustained during a fall or other high-energy trauma have concomitant injuries, including fracture of the contralateral calcaneus and compression fractures of the thoracolumbar spine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F89237%7EEM%2F89238\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef89237 graphicRef89238 \">image 3A-B</a>), and areas of concern based upon the clinical evaluation should be imaged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heel-pain-in-the-active-child-or-skeletally-immature-adolescent-overview-of-causes/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>].

Case reports have described direct trauma to the posterior heel that directly or indirectly disrupts the tendon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heel-pain-in-the-active-child-or-skeletally-immature-adolescent-overview-of-causes/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. With rupture, patients often report severe pain at the back of the ankle and have difficulty bearing weight. Some also describe a &quot;pop&quot;. However, the absence of pain does not rule out rupture. Physical examination may show a gap in the tendon contour compared to the unaffected side and a proximal nodule in the calf. The calf squeeze or Thompson test (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F74412\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef74412 \">picture 1</a>) demonstrates no plantar flexion when the gastrocnemius muscle is squeezed.

Other important causes include plantar fasciitis, painful heel pad syndrome (heel contusion), Achilles tendinitis, retrocalcaneal bursitis, and calcaneal stress fracture.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H171104602\"><span class=\"h2\">Calcaneal apophysitis (Sever disease)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An apophysis is a growth plate that does not contribute to the linear growth of the bone. The calcaneal apophysis, located on the posterior inferior aspect of the calcaneus, is the growth plate at the insertion of the Achilles tendon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63409\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63409 \">figure 1</a>). It normally develops at an earlier age in girls than in boys (six versus eight years of age, respectively) and is present for approximately three to four years. The calcaneal apophysis displays increased metabolic activity during periods of rapid growth, which can place it at risk for overuse injury. Factors that can lead to this injury are: participation in sports or other activities that involve running or jumping, abnormal heel striking that can result in repetitive microtrauma to the area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heel-pain-in-the-active-child-or-skeletally-immature-adolescent-overview-of-causes/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], and excessive traction placed on the area by the Achilles tendon.</p><p>Calcaneal apophysitis is one of the most common causes of heel pain in active children, particularly those who play soccer and basketball or participate in gymnastics or <span class=\"nowrap\">track/running</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heel-pain-in-the-active-child-or-skeletally-immature-adolescent-overview-of-causes/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. In one study, the incidence of calcaneal apophysitis in general practice was 3.7 cases per 1000 patients.

In the calcaneal compression test, the examiner holds the affected heel in his or her palm with the fingers enveloping the upper portion of the heel and then squeezes to compress the heel in the transverse plane.

Physical therapy is also often employed at this time to help the patient improve calf flexibility and strength, especially eccentric gastrocnemius strength that will soften heel striking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/heel-pain-in-the-active-child-or-skeletally-immature-adolescent-overview-of-causes/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

It occurs less commonly in children and adolescents, but it does occur in athletes (particularly distance runners and dancers) and in sedentary, obese children. Excessive, prolonged foot pronation is a predisposing factor. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=plantar-fasciitis#H23254794\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Plantar fasciitis&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p>Many patients with plantar fasciitis have the &quot;first step in the morning&quot; symptom, in which the pain occurs for the first few minutes after getting out of bed and then improves or resolves. This first step may be easily confused with morning stiffness associated with spondyloarthropathies. As the course of plantar fasciitis progresses, pain may return during activity or at the end of the day. The patient may report that it feels as if there is a rock in his or her shoe. The pain is lessened if the patient walks on the outside of the foot. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=plantar-fasciitis#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Plantar fasciitis&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations, evaluation, and diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>The area of maximal tenderness typically is over the medial calcaneal tubercle and, less commonly, into the arch (usually in patients with pes cavus). Pain is best appreciated when the great toe is passively dorsiflexed, causing the plantar fascia to become taut and easy to palpate (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F76161\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76161 \">picture 2</a>). Examination also should include evaluation for tight gastrocnemius and pes planus because the treatment plan may vary if these conditions are present.

Inflammation of the medial calcaneal branch of the tibial nerve (a type of tarsal tunnel syndrome) can mimic plantar fasciitis. However, patients with this pathology will not have the &quot;first step of the morning&quot; sign, will often manifest a positive Tinel sign (tapping over the tibial nerve causes pain and paresthesia), and may have altered sensation.

Painful heel pad syndrome may result from disruption of the fibrous septae that compartmentalize the fat in the heel pad.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spondyloarthritis-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Spondyloarthritis in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oligoarticular-juvenile-idiopathic-arthritis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Oligoarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The diagnostic criteria for oligoarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and pediatric spondyloarthropathy are discussed separately.

Tarsal tunnel syndrome will affect individuals with increased pressure in the tunnel or tension on the nerve. Pressure can be the result of improper foot orthosis or boot pressing on the tarsal tunnel, scar tissue from prior foot injury, as well as runners with inadequate hip stability in midstance will commonly hit the contralateral tarsal tunnel with the opposite shoe as it swings forward. Tension on the nerve occurs from excessive foot pronation. Injury to the tibial nerve causes neuropathic pain that typically radiates to the plantar surface of the forefoot (medial and lateral plantar branches) or the medial calcaneus (medial calcaneal branch). This is classic tarsal tunnel syndrome. Over time, compression of the tarsal tunnel can also result from injury of the posterior tibialis or flexor hallucis tendons. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-lower-extremity-peripheral-nerve-syndromes#H27\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of lower extremity peripheral nerve syndromes&quot;, section on 'Tarsal tunnel syndrome'</a>.)</p><p>Patients with tarsal tunnel syndrome typically present with aching, burning, numbness, and tingling involving the sole of the foot, the distal foot, the toes, and occasionally the heel. The pain may radiate up to the medial ankle. The discomfort is often most irritating at night, may be worse after standing, and sometimes leads to the desire to remove the shoes. The physical examination may be normal in patients with tarsal tunnel syndrome of relatively recent onset. Runners may have evidence of chronic abrasions on the posterior medial ankle. Other key findings include swelling below and posterior to the medial malleolus. Examination may disclose a prominent Tinel's sign (paresthesia when tapping over the nerve posterior to the medial malleolus) with sensory loss over the plantar surface of the foot, not extending onto the dorsal foot. Diagnosis may require nerve conduction studies in patients with equivocal clinical findings.

Careful localization of the tenderness can help to narrow the differential diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63409\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef63409 \">figure 1</a>).

Other important causes include plantar fasciitis, painful heel pad syndrome (heel contusion), Achilles tendinitis, retrocalcaneal bursitis, and calcaneal stress fracture. (See <a href=\"#H171104338\" class=\"local\">'Overuse injuries'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most bone conditions that cause heel pain are benign and include unicameral bone cysts and osteoid osteomas. Rarely, Ewing sarcoma may arise in the calcaneus. (See <a href=\"#H171104345\" class=\"local\">'Bone conditions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cutaneous infections (cellulitis or abscess) involving the sole of the foot frequently follow disruption of the skin (eg, blister, puncture wound, or insect bite) or may arise from a retained foreign body such as a splinter, rock, or piece of glass. Extension of infection may cause an osteomyelitis. Plantar warts commonly occur on pressure points in the ball of the foot and the heel (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F53424\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53424 \">picture 3</a>). Enthesitis at the insertion of the Achilles or plantar fascia on the calcaneus in the pediatric population should trigger clinicians to consider an inflammatory etiology. Reactive arthritis and rheumatologic disease are the two major considerations. Tarsal tunnel syndrome is caused by compression or inflammation of the tibial nerve.
