Furthermore, the primary treatment of metastatic gastric cancer is chemotherapy, and total gastrectomy (which is associated with significant morbidities) can delay or prevent the patient from receiving treatment. Symptoms of obstruction are best managed by stenting, bypass, distal feeding tube, or palliative care.

The position of the gastroesophageal junction and the presence of hiatal hernia should also be noted. Total gastrectomy in patients with a shortened esophagus may require extension of the incision into the thorax. </p><p>For patients with hereditary diffuse gastric cancer, endoscopy should include a least 15 random biopsies of the antrum, incisura, fundus, and body if no gross mucosal abnormalities are noted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-gastrectomy-and-gastrointestinal-reconstruction/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H465973907\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> above.). </p><p>Whether or not all patients with adenocarcinoma require staging laparoscopy prior to total gastrectomy, or just those with advanced disease, is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-gastrectomy-and-gastrointestinal-reconstruction/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. For most patients undergoing total gastrectomy, we perform staging laparoscopy just prior to the planned gastrectomy, rather than as a separate procedure. If metastatic disease is found, a laparotomy incision is prevented, and the patient can be transitioned to palliative care. There is no formal role for staging laparoscopy for other malignant tumors of the stomach. The indications for staging laparoscopy and general procedural details for performing staging laparoscopy for digestive malignancies are discussed elsewhere.

In general, patients undergoing total gastrectomy are older. A review of the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked database from the years 1992 to 2002 revealed that 60 percent of patients undergoing surgery for gastric cancer were over the age of 75 years and approximately 70 percent had greater than two associated comorbidities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-gastrectomy-and-gastrointestinal-reconstruction/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Since the majority of total gastric resections are performed under elective circumstances, there is adequate time for risk assessment and optimization of the patient's medical status. Preoperative medical assessment is discussed elsewhere.

Patients should receive intravenous antibiotics prior to the incision, and dosing should be repeated intraoperatively for cases lasting more than three hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-gastrectomy-and-gastrointestinal-reconstruction/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Randomized trials in patients undergoing gastrectomy (partial or total) have found no benefit for longer duration postoperative antibiotics over perioperative (24 hour) dosing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-gastrectomy-and-gastrointestinal-reconstruction/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].

Extrapolating from systematic reviews of randomized trials that do not show a benefit for mechanical bowel preparation prior to elective colorectal surgery, bowel preparation should not be necessary prior to total gastrectomy even if the colon also requires resection. </p><p>However, there may be a role for oral enteral decontamination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-gastrectomy-and-gastrointestinal-reconstruction/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>]. One trial that evaluated oral antibiotic decontamination prior to total gastrectomy randomly assigned 260 patients to placebo or oral decontamination with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polymyxin-b-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">polymyxin B</a> (100 mg), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tobramycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tobramycin</a> (80 mg), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> (125 mg), and amphotericin B (500 mg) four times per day orally from the day before the operation until postoperative day seven [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-gastrectomy-and-gastrointestinal-reconstruction/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. On intention-to-treat analysis, significantly fewer esophagojejunostomy anastomotic leaks occurred in the oral decontamination group compared with the placebo group (2.9 versus 10.6 percent). The rate of pulmonary infection was also significantly lower among those who received oral decontamination (8.8 versus 22.3 percent). Mortality rates were not significantly different. Unfortunately, there was a high dropout rate during follow-up (55 of 260 patients). A subsequent smaller study did not find a significant difference [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-gastrectomy-and-gastrointestinal-reconstruction/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

Each approach is technically demanding and best performed by surgeons with advanced skills and training. Although various groups have reported satisfactory short- and long-term outcomes from laparoscopic total gastrectomy, it should be noted that these reports are almost exclusively from high-volume cancer hospitals with extensive laparoscopic experience [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-gastrectomy-and-gastrointestinal-reconstruction/abstract/14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-16</a>]. One case series reported a higher perioperative mortality rate and an increased risk of anastomotic leak after laparoscopic total gastrectomy compared with open surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-gastrectomy-and-gastrointestinal-reconstruction/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H376610163\"><span class=\"h2\">Margins of resection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For cancer resection, frozen sections at the proximal and distal gastric margins should be obtained to be certain that the margins are free of carcinoma. </p><p>When performing prophylactic gastrectomy for hereditary diffuse gastric cancer, the distal resection should be carried at least one centimeter distal to the pylorus. Frozen sections should be obtained of the proximal margin to confirm that all gastric mucosa has been removed. If gastric mucosa at the proximal resection is identified, a more proximal resection to esophageal mucosa is needed. Extension of the incision into the left thorax may be needed to achieve an adequate proximal margin in patients with a shortened esophagus. </p><p>In the setting of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), frozen section evaluation may not be necessary, since the gross margin is representative of the microscopic extent of the tumor.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H465975690\"><span class=\"h2\">Extent of nodal dissection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients with gastric cancer, lymphadenectomy is performed with the gastric resection.

The extent of lymph node dissection remains highly controversial. A D1 lymph node resection is the minimal accepted standard. Randomized trials have failed to find a survival benefit for more aggressive surgery, although it may be an acceptable offer in skilled hands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-gastrectomy-and-gastrointestinal-reconstruction/abstract/18-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-25</a>]. A minimum of 15 lymph nodes should be harvested, regardless of type of lymph node dissection, to ensure accurate staging of the patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-gastrectomy-and-gastrointestinal-reconstruction/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

But, since lymph node metastases are common with gastric carcinoid, a lymph node dissection should be performed.

Minor leaks without systemic sepsis can be managed conservatively with antibiotics, intestinal decompression, and percutaneous drainage of any associated fluid collections or abscess. Intestinal decompression in the absence of the stomach is accomplished using a nasogastric tube placed into the jejunum distal to the esophageal anastomosis, typically using fluoroscopic guidance. </p><p>Major disruption that requires reoperation is fraught with difficulties, and is associated with increased mortality. Overall, the mortality rate associated with disruption of the esophago-jejunal anastomosis is approximately 30 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/total-gastrectomy-and-gastrointestinal-reconstruction/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].

Total gastrectomy is the treatment of choice for certain malignancies of the proximal stomach, diffuse signet ring gastric adenocarcinoma, and hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (CDH1 mutation), both in the prophylactic setting and when invasive gastric cancer has been confirmed. Benign indications for total gastrectomy are rare, but may include hemorrhagic gastritis, and intractable symptoms in patients who have undergone prior partial gastrectomy. Metastatic disease and severe medical comorbidities contraindicate total gastrectomy. (See <a href=\"#H465974905\" class=\"local\">'Indications'</a> above and <a href=\"#H465973907\" class=\"local\">'Contraindications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For all patients undergoing total gastrectomy, we recommend intravenous antibiotic prophylaxis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Appropriate antibiotic choices are given in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F65369\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65369 \">table 1</a>). Mechanical bowel preparation is not necessary but oral antibiotic decontamination of the gastrointestinal tract prior to total gastrectomy may decrease the rate of esophageal leak. However, before routine oral decontamination can be recommended, additional well-designed studies are needed. (See <a href=\"#H465975401\" class=\"local\">'Antibiotics'</a> above and <a href=\"#H87993827\" class=\"local\">'Bowel preparation and decontamination'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antimicrobial-prophylaxis-for-prevention-of-surgical-site-infection-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antimicrobial prophylaxis for prevention of surgical site infection in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=control-measures-to-prevent-surgical-site-infection-following-gastrointestinal-procedures-in-adults#H2235476\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Control measures to prevent surgical site infection following gastrointestinal procedures in adults&quot;, section on 'Gastroduodenal procedures'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thromboprophylaxis should be administered according the patient's risk for thromboembolism (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F83739\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef83739 \">table 2</a>). For patients undergoing total gastrectomy for malignancy, we recommend pharmacologic prophylaxis over no prophylaxis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). These patients are at moderate-to-high risk for thromboembolism. For all patients, we suggest intermittent pneumatic compression (IPC), rather than no compression (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). IPC devices should be placed prior to induction of anesthesia, and continued until the patient is ambulatory. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-venous-thromboembolic-disease-in-surgical-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of venous thromboembolic disease in surgical patients&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients undergoing total gastrectomy for malignancy should undergo preoperative staging to rule out metastatic disease, including computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen, and upper endoscopy, which can be used to evaluate the extent of locoregional disease using ultrasound, but also evaluates the anatomy of the esophagus and stomach, which may affect the type of reconstruction. Staging laparoscopy may be indicated for patients with gastric adenocarcinoma; however, whether or not all patients require staging laparoscopy prior to total gastrectomy, or just those with advanced disease, is controversial. There is no formal role for staging laparoscopy for other malignant tumors of the stomach. (See <a href=\"#H465973914\" class=\"local\">'Tumor staging'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-invasive-gastric-cancer#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of invasive gastric cancer&quot;, section on 'Staging evaluation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Total gastrectomy is accomplished usually via a midline laparotomy by exposing and isolating the stomach, dividing the esophagus and proximal duodenum, removing the specimen, and then restoring gastrointestinal continuity.

For adenocarcinoma, the margins should be clear of tumor. For patients undergoing prophylactic gastrectomy, the proximal margin should be clear of gastric mucosa. (See <a href=\"#H376610163\" class=\"local\">'Margins of resection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients undergoing total gastrectomy for gastric adenocarcinoma or carcinoid, we perform a D1 lymphadenectomy, rather than a lesser (D0) or greater amount (D2). A more extended lymphadenectomy increases perioperative morbidity and mortality of an already potentially morbid operation. For patients undergoing prophylactic gastrectomy for CDH1 mutation, gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST), or the rare instance of total gastrectomy for benign reasons, lymphadenectomy is not needed. (See <a href=\"#H465975690\" class=\"local\">'Extent of nodal dissection'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-invasive-gastric-cancer#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of invasive gastric cancer&quot;, section on 'Extent of lymph node dissection'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Whenever possible, the hepatic branch of the anterior vagus nerve and the celiac branch of the posterior vagus nerve should be preserved, rather than sacrificing these nerves with the specimen.
