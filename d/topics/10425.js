Little information is available on management strategies or the efficacy and safety of therapeutic antithrombotic agents in infancy. These patients usually need to be treated with antihypertensive therapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The approach to an individual infant must balance the risks and benefits. A reasonable strategy is to manage asymptomatic thrombosis by close monitoring of the size of the thrombus, usually by ultrasonography, and by providing supportive care. This approach avoids development of bleeding complications that may be associated with anticoagulant or fibrinolytic therapy. Most thrombi resolve without specific therapy, and the patient may be able to wean off of antihypertensive medications.

Left ventricular hypertrophy would be an indication for the initiation of drug therapy. Similarly, treatment should be strongly considered if there is proven underlying renal disease.</p><p>Older infants with either systolic or diastolic BP values between the 95<sup>th</sup> and 99<sup>th</sup> percentile should be reevaluated to see whether the elevated BP remains persistent, as in older children. In hospitalized infants, this can occur over several days. In the ambulatory setting, repeating BP measurements in two to three weeks is reasonable. If BP elevation remains persistent, the decision whether to institute pharmacologic therapy should be made based upon the underlying cause of hypertension and whether or not there is evidence of end-organ injury.

Continuous infusions of intravenous medications should be used, as they act quickly and have a short half-life, which allows titration to the desired effect. As in older children, we recommend BP should be lowered in a controlled fashion by no more than 25 percent over the first eight hours. Further reduction to the target BP (usually either the 90<sup>th</sup> or 95<sup>th</sup> percentiles for age) can be made over the next 24 to 36 hours. Intravenous bolus infusions and potent oral medications should be avoided because they may lower BP too precipitously, and their duration of action may be too long.

The information is derived from small case series reporting use of antihypertensive drugs in newborns <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> older infants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypertension-in-infants/abstract/2-7,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-7,13,14</a>]. Given the lack of properly conducted clinical trials in this age group, treatment is usually empiric, and the choice of therapy relies upon clinical experience and judgment. In addition, the availability of specific agents, especially oral liquid formulations, will vary among institutions. Thus, consultation with a pediatric nephrologist or other clinician with experience in the management of neonatal hypertension is recommended.</p><p>Despite the paucity of data, all classes of antihypertensive agents have been used in the treatment of hypertension in neonates and older infants, including diuretics, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, and direct vasodilators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypertension-in-infants/abstract/15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-18</a>]. Suggested doses for antihypertensive medications commonly used in infants can be found in the linked table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63077\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63077 \">table 3</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H449254635\"><span class=\"h3\">Approach for anti-hypertensive drug therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When antihypertensive therapy is initiated, it is best to begin with a single drug, increasing the dose in a stepwise fashion to the maximum dose until the blood pressure (BP) is controlled. If hypertension persists, or adverse effects of the first drug are seen, a second drug should be added. The choice of antihypertensive agent is dependent upon the severity of hypertension. For infants with severe hypertension, continuous intravenous antihypertensive administration (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nicardipine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">nicardipine</a>) is preferred so that BP can be rapidly modified and safely lowered based upon patient response. Oral agents can be used in patients with less severe hypertension. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-neonatal-hypertension#H2915536\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis of neonatal hypertension&quot;, section on 'Definition'</a> and <a href=\"#H155183048\" class=\"local\">'Approach to pharmacologic treatment'</a> above.)</p><p>The following sections review specific classes of antihypertensive agents in infants.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H195796899\"><span class=\"h2\">Diuretics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diuretics reduce extracellular and plasma volume, resulting in a modest decrease in BP. Their use in newborns usually is limited to mild hypertension resulting from volume overload or as a second-line medication when the BP is unable to be controlled using a single agent. Diuretic therapy may also be beneficial in improving lung function in infants with bronchopulmonary dysplasia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-bronchopulmonary-dysplasia#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of bronchopulmonary dysplasia&quot;, section on 'Diuretics'</a>.)</p><p>If diuretics are used in the treatment of hypertension in infants, thiazide diuretics (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorothiazide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">chlorothiazide</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrochlorothiazide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">hydrochlorothiazide</a>) are generally preferred to loop diuretics (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">furosemide</a>) because of the increased risk of adverse effects with loop diuretics. Loop diuretics are associated with a greater risk of electrolyte abnormalities, particularly hypokalemia, and may also lead to nephrocalcinosis due to hypercalciuria. If a diuretic is indicated, we suggest starting with a low dose of either chlorothiazide (10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day, divided Q 12 hours) or hydrochlorothiazide (1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> per day) and making adjustments every three to four days. Chlorothiazide is commercially available as a suspension and may therefore be easier to use in infants (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63077\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63077 \">table 3</a>). Electrolytes should be monitored within 72 hours after introducing a diuretic.</p><p>Potassium-sparing diuretics such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spironolactone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">spironolactone</a> were generally not felt to be useful in the management of hypertension in infants, however, the use of spironolactone as monotherapy was reported to be effective in a United States case series of hypertensive neonates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-hypertension-in-infants/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In that study, many infants were found to have low renin and aldosterone, suggestive of volume overload.

Although few data exist on the neonatal effect of ACE inhibitors, the known adverse effects on fetal renal development with the maternal use of these agents have led to concerns that they may impair the final stages of renal maturation when given to newborn infants. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-receptor-blockers-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and receptor blockers in pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Based on the above concerns, we typically avoid use of ACE inhibitors until the infant has reached a corrected postmenstrual age of 44 weeks. Although there are not similar data on the use of angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) in neonates, we would also avoid the use of ARBs because of similar concerns regarding their effect on renal development.</p><p>If an ACE inhibitor is selected for use in an older infant, it should be noted that these agents are contraindicated in patients with bilateral renovascular disease or renovascular disease in a solitary kidney.

Given the high prevalence of renovascular and other renal parenchymal causes of hypertension, serial renal imaging should also be considered.
