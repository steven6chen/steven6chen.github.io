The main goals of staging are to measure the extent of disease and associated prognostic factors, and to define disease manifestations that can be reevaluated during and after treatment to determine the effectiveness of therapy. Staging also serves an important role for the comparison of treatments among studies.</p><p>The TNM (tumor node metastasis) staging system that is generally used for solid tumors is not applicable to lymphoma, since it is based upon the concept of a primary tumor and metastasis. Instead, the staging system used for HL is an anatomical classification, which is based upon the concept that HL spreads in a predictable pattern of contiguous disease. HL starts at a single site within the lymphatic system, usually a lymph node, and then progresses to adjacent lymph nodes via lymphatic channels before disseminating to distant nonadjacent sites and organs.</p><p>Patients with HL are staged according to the Ann Arbor staging system with Cotswolds modifications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. This is a four-stage system (stages I to IV). The original Ann Arbor staging system was developed in 1974 and was principally based upon the use of staging laparotomy and lymphangiogram [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In 1988, the Cotswold modifications added valuable information regarding the presence of bulky disease and the efficacy of imaging studies for staging (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F66651\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66651 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In 2014, the Lugano classification proposed further revisions to clarify the role of positron emission tomography (PET) and better define extranodal involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>For treatment purposes, cases of HL are commonly classified as early stage disease (stage I to II) or advanced stage disease (stage III to IV). Patients with early stage HL are then further stratified into favorable and unfavorable subsets.</p><p>This topic review will discuss the staging of patients with HL. Other topic reviews discuss the clinical presentation, diagnosis, treatment, and other prognostic measures of these patients.

While further revisions have been proposed at a meeting in Lugano (ie, the Lugano classification), the proposed revisions are controversial and not widely accepted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Patients are staged using information from a clinical examination and imaging studies. They are placed into one of four stages, based upon the sites of involvement, and are assigned numbers and letters that designate the number of lymph node regions involved and the presence or absence of systemic symptoms or of bulky or extended disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F66651\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66651 \">table 1</a>). For these purposes, the tonsils, Waldeyer's ring, and spleen are considered nodal tissue.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage I &ndash; Involvement of a single lymph node region (I) or of a single extralymphatic organ or site (I<sub>E</sub>) without nodal involvement. A single lymph node region can include one node or a group of adjacent nodes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage II &ndash; Involvement of two or more lymph node regions on the same side of the diaphragm alone (II) or with involvement of limited, contiguous extralymphatic organ or tissue (II<sub>E</sub>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage III &ndash; Involvement of lymph node regions or lymphoid structures on both sides of the diaphragm.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage IV &ndash; Additional noncontiguous extralymphatic involvement, with or without associated lymphatic involvement.</p><p/><p>All cases are subclassified to indicate the absence (A) or presence (B) of one or more of the following three systemic symptoms: unexplained fevers to more than 101&deg;F (38.3&deg;C), drenching night sweats, or unexplained weight loss exceeding 10 percent of body weight during the six months prior to diagnosis. Fatigue, pruritus, and alcohol-induced pain are not considered B symptoms but should be noted.</p><p>The subscript &quot;X&quot; is used if bulky disease is present and the size of the bulky disease should be noted. No subscripts are used in the absence of bulk. Criteria for bulky disease used for treatment purposes are discussed in more detail below. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Criteria for bulky disease'</a> below.)</p><p>The subscript &quot;E&quot; is used if limited extranodal extension is documented. More extensive extranodal disease is designated stage IV. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Criteria for extranodal spread'</a> below.)</p><p>Patients with stage III or stage IV disease are considered to have advanced stage disease. Patients with stage I or stage II disease are considered to have early (limited) stage disease and are then further stratified for treatment purposes into favorable and unfavorable prognosis disease based upon the presence or absence of certain clinical features, such as age, B symptoms, and large mediastinal adenopathy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Staging studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with HL are staged clinically using information gathered from a history, physical examination, and imaging studies. </p><p>The preferred imaging modality is an integrated <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> scan of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. HL is a fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-avid lymphoma, and the incorporation of PET results in a stage change in approximately 20 percent of patients, and approximately half of these stage changes will result in more aggressive management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/5-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-8</a>]. If PET is unavailable, a contrast-enhanced CT is used for staging. </p><p>A chest radiograph is not required for staging. Most patients with HL have cervical <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> supraclavicular nodal involvement, the extent of which can often be determined on the <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span>. However, if the <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> does not provide sufficient detail for radiation treatment planning, then a dedicated CT of the neck should be obtained. We do not advocate the use of bone marrow biopsy in the staging of most patients with HL. (See <a href=\"#H520756345\" class=\"local\">'Bone marrow biopsy'</a> below.)</p><p>While pathological staging was used frequently in the past, it has largely been abandoned because of the associated morbidity, improved imaging techniques, and a shift in practice away from the use of radiation therapy alone for the treatment of early stage disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Determining organ involvement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The anatomic criteria for clinical staging are defined as follows:</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Lymph nodes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Physical examination at the time of diagnosis should note the regions of lymph nodes involved. For staging purposes, lymph node involvement is defined as the clinical enlargement of a node when alternative pathology may reasonably be ruled out; the enlargement can be determined by physical examination, plain radiograph, or <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> scanning. <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> scanning is the preferred modality. FDG uptake on the PET scan is usually reported using a visual assessment, noting the location of increased focal uptake and distinguishing it from physiologic uptake and other patterns of disease with increased FDG uptake (eg, infection and inflammation) according to distribution <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> CT characteristics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. A dedicated contrast-enhanced CT scan may be required in additional to the <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> to define the extent of disease in special situations, such as in the setting of lymphadenopathy close to bowel or if there is compression or thrombosis of blood vessels. Suspicious nodes should always be biopsied if treatment decisions are based on their involvement and imaging studies are indeterminant.</p><p>For staging purposes, the lymph nodes are divided into anatomic regions that can be encompassed by a single radiation field, as follows (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F55422\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55422 \">figure 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Waldeyer's ring (tonsils, base of the tongue, nasopharynx)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ipsilateral cervical and supraclavicular</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Occipital and pre-auricular</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infraclavicular</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Axillary and pectoral</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mediastinal (thymus, prevascular, aortopulmonary; paratracheal, pretracheal, subcarinal, and posterior mediastinal)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hilar</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Paraaortic</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spleen</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Iliac</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ipsilateral inguinal and femoral</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Epitrochlear and brachial</p><p/><p>All nodal disease within the mediastinum is considered to be a single lymph node region. Hilar nodes are considered separate from the mediastinum and should be considered to be &quot;lateralized&quot; (right hilar and left hilar nodes are separate regions) such that, when involved on both sides, constitute stage II disease. Internal mammary nodes are part of the lymphatic system of the chest wall and drain the diaphragm. Paravertebral nodes, although in the posterior mediastinum, also drain the chest wall and diaphragm. For staging purposes, the internal mammary and paravertebral nodes in the chest can be considered mediastinal nodes. Mesenteric nodes and popliteal nodes are also considered as separate nodal areas, although involvement of these two regions is almost never seen in early stage disease. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Spleen</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For staging purposes, splenic involvement is determined by <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> demonstrating one of the following: diffuse infiltration with miliary lesions, focal nodular lesions, or a large solitary mass [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Liver</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For staging purposes, liver involvement is determined by <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> demonstrating focal FDG uptake, with or without focal or disseminated nodules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].

Marrow infiltration by malignant cells occurs in up to 6.5 percent of patients with newly diagnosed HL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This is closely associated with advanced clinical stage, occurring in much less than 1 percent of patients with early stage disease (ie, stage IA or IIA) by CT and virtually no patients with early stage disease by combined <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>]. </p><p>The value of bone marrow biopsy in the staging of HL has steadily decreased with the improvement of noninvasive imaging studies and the evolution of treatment paradigms toward the universal incorporation of systemic chemotherapy. The original Ann Arbor staging system developed in 1971 required &quot;pathologic staging&quot; with bone marrow biopsy, splenectomy, and liver biopsy in order to identify disease that might be cured with radiation therapy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Following the widespread incorporation of CT into staging, the 1989 Cotswold modifications limited unilateral bone marrow biopsy to patients with B symptoms; clinical stage IIB to IV disease; or anemia, leukopenia, or thrombocytopenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Observational studies have demonstrated that bone marrow biopsy results do not impact the choice of therapy in most patients with HL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/11,14,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,14,16</a>]. A potential exception is the patient with bulky chest disease and low volume stage III disease for whom radiation therapy might be used if the marrow has no evidence of disease but would be omitted if the marrow were positive.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Central nervous system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Central nervous system (CNS) involvement may be missed on <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> imaging due to the increased physiologic FDG uptake in the normal brain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. In those extremely rare cases when CNS involvement is suspected clinically, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be performed to evaluate further. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Other sites</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinical involvement of other extranodal sites may only be diagnosed if the site is contiguous or proximal to a known nodal site (ie, an E lesion). Lung involvement may be identified when there is radiological evidence of parenchymal involvement on <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT,</span> in the absence of other likely causes, particularly infection. Bone involvement is suggested by a history of pain or elevation of serum alkaline phosphatase, and further supported by changes on plain radiograph or evidence from other imaging studies (isotope, CT, or MRI).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Criteria for B symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systemic B symptoms generally correlate with advanced stage and bulk disease and portend a worse prognosis. However, occasional patients with early stage or small-volume HL have significant B symptoms, a finding that remains unexplained. There are three systemic B symptoms accepted as part of the staging system and are defined as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unexplained weight loss of more than 10 percent of body weight during the six months before initial staging investigation</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unexplained persistent or recurrent fever with temperatures above 38&deg;C (&gt;100.4&deg;F) during the previous month</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recurrent drenching night sweats during the previous month</p><p/><p>Fever and weight loss appear to have more prognostic significance than drenching night sweats, which are considered by some to be the least important of the B symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. In one series, for example, patients with pathologically staged IA to IIA disease who had night sweats as their only B symptom had a similar prognosis to those without night sweats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In contrast, patients with fever and weight loss had reduced survival, whether treated by radiation therapy alone or combined modality therapy.</p><p>Although other symptoms may be associated with HL, they are not classified as B symptoms. However, some of these symptoms, such as severe pruritus and alcohol induced pain, may prove to be of prognostic significance and should be recorded [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Criteria for bulky disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bulky disease is denoted in the staging system by the subscript &quot;X.&quot; For treatment purposes, a mediastinal mass noted on CT scan that is either &ge;10 cm or greater than one-third the internal transverse diameter of the thorax should qualify for bulky disease. Lesions in the liver or spleen are not measured as part of the determination of bulky disease.</p><p>Bulky disease has been variably defined by different investigational groups:</p><p>In the Ann Arbor Staging system with Cotswolds modifications, bulky disease is defined by the presence of one of the following two findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An abdominal node or nodal mass that is 10 cm or greater in largest dimension as determined by CT, MRI, or ultrasound.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A mediastinal mass which has a maximum width equal to or greater than one-third of the internal transverse diameter of the thorax (at the pleural surfaces) at the level of <span class=\"nowrap\">T5/6</span> as determined on a posteroanterior chest radiograph. The <span class=\"nowrap\">T5/6</span> criteria are used in an attempt to create a consistent, reliable, and therefore reproducible measurement.</p><p/><p>In contrast, the proposed Lugano classification defines bulky disease as a nodal mass of 10 cm or greater than one-third of the transthoracic diameter at any level of thoracic vertebrae as determined by CT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>Other definitions of bulk disease have been used to define patients with a worse prognosis, using cutoffs of 6 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>] and 5 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. In the Stanford V protocol, bulky disease, defined as 5 cm or greater, required the use of involved field irradiation following completion of chemotherapy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Criteria for extranodal spread</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The designation &quot;E&quot; refers to extranodal contiguous extension (ie, proximal or contiguous extranodal disease) of HL that can be encompassed within an irradiation field appropriate for nodal disease of the same anatomic extent. Limited extranodal extension is defined by one of the following two criteria:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Involvement of extralymphatic tissue on one side of the diaphragm by limited direct extension from an adjacent nodal site.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An apparently discrete single extranodal deposit consistent with extension from a regionally involved node. If a single extralymphatic site is the only site of disease, the staging should be classified as IE. </p><p/><p>The presence of a single site of extranodal extension (E) is not classified as disseminated disease with the implicit expectation of a prognosis equivalent to that for treatment of nodal disease of the same anatomical extent. As an example, anterior extension of a mediastinal mass into the sternum or chest wall or extension to lung or pericardium should be recorded as extranodal extension. Diffuse or disseminated foci of involvement of one or more extralymphatic organs or tissues, with or without associated lymphatic involvement is designated as stage IV disease.</p><p>The importance of limited extranodal involvement was suggested by a retrospective study that found a striking difference in prognosis between patients with essentially localized extralymphatic organ involvement (contiguous with an involved lymph node region) and disseminated extralymphatic involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">EXAMPLES OF STAGING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following are provided as examples of the application of the Lugano classification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/staging-and-prognosis-of-hodgkin-lymphoma/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An asymptomatic patient with disease limited to nodes of the mediastinum with anterior extension into the sternum would be staged as IIA<sub>E</sub> disease. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An asymptomatic patient with bilateral cervical and right axillary lymph nodes with a small mediastinal mass would be staged as IIA disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A symptomatic patient with night sweats, weight loss of 15 kg, bilateral cervical node enlargement, a 15 cm mediastinal mass on chest CT, involvement of the right hilum, an abdominal CT showing paraaortic and pelvic adenopathy with no definite involvement of the liver, and no evidence of bone marrow involvement on PET would be staged as IIIBX.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A symptomatic patient with disseminated extralymphatic involvement would be staged as IVB.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9398216\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several studies have attempted to use prognostic factors to identify patients at high risk for first relapse and who might benefit from more intensive initial therapy.
