Most lung cancer is attributed to smoking, including lung cancer in nonsmokers in whom a significant proportion of cancer is attributed to environmental smoke exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lung-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The promotion of smoking cessation is essential, as cigarette smoking is thought to be causal in 85 to 90 percent of all lung cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lung-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Progress in smoking cessation is now reflected in declining lung cancer rates and mortality in men in the United States. However, the smoking rate in the United States remains high, at 15 percent in 2015 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lung-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], and is increasing in many parts of the world. In addition, a high percentage of lung cancer occurs in former smokers, since the risk for lung cancer does not decline for many years following smoking cessation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lung-cancer/abstract/4-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-7</a>].</p><p>Screening for lung cancer will be reviewed here. General principles of screening, risk factors associated with the development of lung cancer, and techniques for smoking cessation are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evidence-based-approach-to-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evidence-based approach to prevention&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-smoking-cessation-management-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of smoking cessation management in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cigarette-smoking-and-other-possible-risk-factors-for-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cigarette smoking and other possible risk factors for lung cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H129596425\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death among men and women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lung-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Some [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lung-cancer/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>] but not all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lung-cancer/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>] studies suggest that, for any level of smoking, women are at higher risk of developing cancer than men. Worldwide, it is estimated that there are 1.6 million deaths due to lung cancer annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lung-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The American Cancer Society estimates over 234,000 new cases of lung cancer diagnosed yearly and over 154,000 lung cancer-associated deaths in the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lung-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Clinical outcome for non-small cell lung cancer is directly related to stage at the time of diagnosis, ranging from over 60 percent five-year survival for stage I disease to less than 5 percent for stage IV disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F80099\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef80099 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F73088\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73088 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lung-cancer/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In addition, within early lung cancers (stage I), there is a relationship between tumor size and survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lung-cancer/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. Available data are more limited for patients with small cell lung cancer but also support an improved outcome when disease is diagnosed at an early stage. However, 75 percent of patients with lung cancer present with symptoms due to advanced local or metastatic disease that is not amenable to cure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lung-cancer/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Despite advances in therapy, five-year survival rates average approximately 18 percent for all individuals with lung cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lung-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H90385077\"><span class=\"h1\">POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF SCREENING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many characteristics of lung cancer suggest that screening should be effective: high morbidity and mortality, significant prevalence (0.5 to 2.2 percent), identified risk factors allowing targeted screening for high-risk individuals, a lengthy preclinical phase for some types of lung cancer, and evidence that therapy is more effective in early-stage disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lung-cancer/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. </p><p>The potential of screening to detect early cancers may both increase the overall cure rate and allow more limited surgical resection to achieve cure. However, screening may not accomplish these goals unless it takes place in the context of a multidisciplinary program to ensure that screening is properly performed and results properly interpreted, and followed up, and that disease, when detected, is managed appropriately.</p><p>The success of lung cancer screening can be assessed using various outcome measures, including cancer detection rates, stage at detection, survival, disease-specific mortality, and overall mortality. For a lethal disease such as lung cancer, which requires invasive procedures for detection and treatment, the most important outcomes to assess are disease-specific and overall mortality. (See <a href=\"#H75373691\" class=\"local\">'National Lung Screening Trial'</a> below and <a href=\"#H75373873\" class=\"local\">'Other trials'</a> below.)</p><p>In addition to the possibility of mortality reduction due to earlier disease detection, several studies found that participation in a randomized controlled trial of lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) scan was associated with a favorable impact on smoking cessation rates. However, results are mixed as to whether favorable quit rates were associated with being invited to participate in a trial, being screened rather than being in the control group, or having more or less favorable results of screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lung-cancer/abstract/20-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H75374308\"><span class=\"h1\">POTENTIAL HARMS OF SCREENING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While screening for lung cancer has the potential benefits of decreased morbidity and mortality from lung cancer, it also has potential harms, which include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Consequences of evaluating abnormal findings</strong> &ndash; Detection of abnormalities that require further evaluation, most of which are benign nodules, may involve needle biopsy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> surgery, with associated morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lung-cancer/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. In the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), over 53,000 high-risk individuals were randomly assigned to LDCT scan or chest radiograph screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lung-cancer/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Among abnormal results (24.2 percent of LDCT scans and 6.9 percent of radiographs), 96 percent were false-positive (that is, did not lead to a diagnosis of lung cancer) and 11 percent of the positive results led to an invasive study. Most positive studies are resolved with imaging and prove to be false-positive exams.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Implementation of LDCT lung cancer screening in the Veterans Health Administration also provided information about the potential need for follow-up testing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lung-cancer/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Among the 2106 patients who underwent lung cancer screening, 1184 (56 percent) had lung nodules that had to be tracked (the majority of nodules were &lt;5 mm). A total of 73 patients (3.5 percent of all people screened) had findings suspicious for possible lung cancer and underwent further diagnostic evaluation, with 31 patients (1.5 percent of all people screened) diagnosed with lung cancer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Approximately 40 percent of screened patients had incidental findings such as emphysema or coronary calcifications. Although incidental findings may not require follow-up testing, they may cause patient worry and may require a clinician to counsel the patient and determine if additional testing is indicated. Findings within the well-organized US Department of Veterans Affairs screening program, which includes older patients, smokers, and many high-risk patients, as well as experts in lung cancer and imaging, may not be generalizable to the general population of smokers and ex-smokers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Radiation exposure</strong> &ndash; Radiation from serial imaging in a screening program may add independently to the risk of developing cancers, including lung cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lung-cancer/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Since screening typically occurs over several rounds and positive studies require further evaluation, the cumulative radiation dose is also important. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-related-risks-of-imaging#H2016162\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation-related risks of imaging&quot;, section on 'Effective dose'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In secondary analysis of a LDCT screening program for asymptomatic high-risk smokers age 50 and above who were screened at least annually [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lung-cancer/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], the estimated median cumulative effective radiation dose after 10 years of screening was 13.0 millisieverts (mSv) for women and 9.3 mSv for men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lung-cancer/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. It was estimated that for every 108 lung cancers discovered by screening, one major cancer would be induced by radiation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For LDCT, the estimated effective radiation dose is 1.4 mSv compared with average effective radiation doses of 7 to 8 mSv for one standard-dose diagnostic chest CT and 0.1 mSv for one chest radiograph (posterior-anterior [PA] and lateral) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lung-cancer/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-related-risks-of-imaging#H147223785\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation-related risks of imaging&quot;, section on 'Radiation dose for common imaging exams and procedures'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Patient distress</strong> &ndash; Prolonged follow-up of nodules, often lasting several years, may cause anxiety related to fear of having lung cancer. Few trials have evaluated patient distress with LDCT screening. A 2014 systematic review of five randomized trials and one cohort study found that LDCT screening may be associated with short-term psychologic discomfort but did not affect distress, worry, or health-related quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lung-cancer/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. False-positive results were associated with short-term increases in distress. A subsequent study evaluated health-related quality of life and anxiety in 2800 patients who were a subset of participants in the NLST [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lung-cancer/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Compared with patients who had negative screens, the study found no differences in outcomes at one and six months in those with false-positive screens or screens with significant incidental findings.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Overdiagnosis</strong> &ndash; Some cancers identified at screening, if never found, would not have affected morbidity or mortality during the patient's lifetime [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lung-cancer/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Identification of such cancers is referred to as &quot;overdiagnosis.&quot; Overdiagnosis could be expected to have greater impact in screening programs where subjects are at increased risk for other potentially life-threatening comorbidities, as is the case for smokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lung-cancer/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. The risk for unnecessary invasive studies and therapy for &quot;overdiagnosed&quot; lung cancer might be greatest in this population. Observational studies of screening for lung cancer with LDCT have estimated the extent of overdiagnosis to range between 13 and 27 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lung-cancer/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although randomized trials demonstrate that screening with LDCT scan can reduce lung cancer and all-cause mortality, some cancers detected by screening may still represent overdiagnosis and lead to unnecessarily aggressive treatment. After 6.5 years of follow-up in the NLST, there were 119 more lung cancers identified in the LDCT group compared with the chest radiograph group (1060 versus 941) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lung-cancer/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. One study has used the NLST data to estimate an upper limit of overdiagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lung-cancer/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>], but this model has been criticized for not taking into account lead or length time bias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lung-cancer/abstract/40,41\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41</a>]. Only long-term follow-up can provide a true estimate of overdiagnosis.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3637816032\"><span class=\"h1\">SCREENING MODALITIES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Chest radiograph/sputum cytology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Screening for lung cancer by chest radiograph <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> sputum cytology is not recommended. There have been at least seven large-scale controlled clinical trials (six randomized, one non-randomized) of chest radiograph screening for lung cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lung-cancer/abstract/42-57\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-57</a>]. These studies began as early as 1960, and a 20-year follow-up analysis has been published for one randomized trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lung-cancer/abstract/53,58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,58,59</a>]. None of the randomized trials have demonstrated a mortality benefit for chest radiograph screening; however, only the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial compared screening with no screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lung-cancer/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p>The PLCO trial is a large randomized trial (n = 154,942) evaluating the impact of screening individuals aged 55 through 74 for several cancers, including lung cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lung-cancer/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>]. Screening for lung cancer consisted of a single posterior-anterior (PA) chest radiograph performed at baseline and annually for three years, while the control group received usual care. This study differs from prior chest radiograph screening trials in several important aspects: the cohort includes men and women in equal numbers, participants are not specifically high risk (51.6 percent current or former smokers), and prevalence screening results are included in the trial and analysis, allowing a true comparison of screening with no screening.</p><p>At the initial screening, 5991 (8.9 percent) of all chest radiographs were abnormal, ranging from 11 percent in current smokers to 8 percent in never-smokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lung-cancer/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. After up to three rounds of annual screening (nonsmokers did not participate in the third screening round), participants were followed through 13 years, with a screening adherence of 86.6 percent at baseline and 79 to 84 percent during years 1 through 3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lung-cancer/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. After 13 years of follow-up, there was no significant difference in lung cancer incidence rates between the screening and usual care groups (20.1 and 19.2 per 10,000 person-years, relative risk [RR] 1.05, 95% CI 0.98-1.12), and no difference in lung cancer mortality rates (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.87-1.22) or stage of disease. Lung cancer incidence was higher in those with prior or current smoking exposure than in nonsmokers, but there was no difference in incidence or mortality between smokers who were in the screening or control groups (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.18-1.10 after six years and RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.87-1.22 after 13 years of follow-up). Only approximately 20 percent of the cancers in the screening group were detected by screening. Thus, annual screening with chest radiograph, compared with usual care, did not reduce lung cancer mortality.</p><p>The lung cancer arm of the PLCO trial was designed to be completed in 2015. However, the monitoring board thought that results would be unlikely to change with longer follow-up and that the current findings had public health significance because of the recent report of the National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) that compared low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening with chest radiograph screening in a high-risk population. Data from the PLCO trial were also analyzed for a subset of patients who would meet the criteria for the NLST. (See <a href=\"#H75373691\" class=\"local\">'National Lung Screening Trial'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Low-dose chest CT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of the lack of a mortality benefit from chest radiograph screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lung-cancer/abstract/64-70\" class=\"abstract_t\">64-70</a>], refinements of CT scanning techniques led to the evaluation of low-dose helical computed tomography (LDCT) for lung cancer screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lung-cancer/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. New multidetector CT scanners generate high-resolution imaging with significantly less radiation exposure than diagnostic chest CT scanning. LDCT refers to a noncontrast study obtained with a multidetector CT scanner during a single maximal inspiratory breath-hold with a scanning time under 25 seconds. High-resolution (1.0 to 2.5 mm interval) images are reconstructed using a soft tissue or thin-section algorithm.</p><p>The estimated effective radiation dose due to LDCT is described elsewhere. (See <a href=\"#H75374308\" class=\"local\">'Potential harms of screening'</a> above.)</p><p>A 2012 systematic review of the benefits and harms of screening with LDCT scan identified the NLST as the only trial demonstrating a mortality benefit, with other trials either too small, still preliminary, or with study design flaws precluding meaningful interpretation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lung-cancer/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. Similarly, a 2013 systematic review also found the NLST to provide the best quality available data regarding screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lung-cancer/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].</p><p>Several observational studies of LDCT scanning have been published and demonstrate that screening with LDCT can identify early-stage asymptomatic lung cancer. The larger observational studies include the Early Lung Cancer Action Program (ELCAP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lung-cancer/abstract/74,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">74,75</a>], the International ELCAP (I-ELCAP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lung-cancer/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>], the Mayo Clinic CT study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lung-cancer/abstract/77-80\" class=\"abstract_t\">77-80</a>], and the Continuous Observation of Smoking (COSMOS) study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lung-cancer/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. However, results from randomized trials are more pertinent to decisions about screening.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H75373691\"><span class=\"h3\">National Lung Screening Trial</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The NLST was a randomized trial comparing annual screening by LDCT scanning with chest radiograph for three years in 53,454 high-risk persons at 33 United States medical centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lung-cancer/abstract/27,81-83\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,81-83</a>]. Participants were men and women 55 to 74 years of age with a history of at least 30 pack-years of smoking, and included current smokers and those who had discontinued smoking within 15 years of enrollment. The NLST demonstrated that LDCT screening reduced mortality in a high-risk population (based on age and smoking history), compared with screening by radiograph (and by inference from the PLCO trial data, compared with usual care). For those undergoing at least one screen, the number needed to screen with LDCT to prevent one lung cancer death was 320.</p><p>The trial was stopped early after an interim analysis found a statistically significant benefit for LDCT scanning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lung-cancer/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. At a median follow-up of 6.5 years, there were 645 cases of lung cancer per 100,000 person-years (1060 cancers) in the LDCT group, and 572 cases per 100,000 person-years (941 cancers) in the chest radiograph group, resulting in an incidence rate ratio of 1.13 (95% CI 1.03-1.23). Per 100,000 person years, there were 247 lung cancer deaths in the CT group and 309 in the radiograph group, yielding a relative mortality reduction of 20 percent (CI 3.8-26.7) and an absolute reduction of 62 lung cancer deaths per 100,000 person years. Importantly, there was also a 6.7 percent (CI 1.2-13.6) relative reduction in all-cause mortality in the LDCT group and an absolute reduction of 74 deaths per 100,000 person-years.</p><p>Positive findings were defined as a noncalcified nodule &ge;4 mm on LDCT scan or any noncalcified nodule on radiograph. Over all three screening rounds, 24.2 of LDCT scans and 6.9 percent of radiographs were abnormal. The cumulative rate of false-positive findings was high: 96.4 and 94.5 percent for LDCT and radiograph screening, respectively. Follow-up for false-positive findings was at the discretion of the institution, 90.4 and 92.7 percent of false-positive screens led to at least one diagnostic procedure, mostly imaging, but including surgery in 297 patients who had LDCT scan and 121 who had radiograph screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lung-cancer/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. The rate of adverse events related to complications from the diagnostic work-up was low: among participants with a positive finding, at least one complication occurred in 1.4 percent of the LDCT group and 1.6 percent of the radiograph group (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F90405\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef90405 \">table 2</a>).</p><p>The rate of detection of lung cancer did not diminish between screening years, suggesting that ongoing screening would be necessary. A retrospective cohort analysis of this study examined the effect of extending the interval of screening for those with an initial negative study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lung-cancer/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. In this study, participants with a negative initial screening LDCT (19,066 out of 26,231) had an overall lower incidence of lung cancer and lung cancer-related mortality than did all participants. The yield of lung cancer diagnosis at the next annual LDCT screening study for these patients was lower compared with all participants (0.34 versus 1.0 percent, respectively). Extrapolating from this, the authors concluded that screening participants with a negative initial LDCT at one year would, at most, result in 28 fewer lung cancer deaths in the annual screening group (decreasing mortality from 212.1 [186.8 to 240.0] per 100,000 person-years to 185.8 [95% CI 162.3-211.9]). Because more frequent screening might cause harm, the study&rsquo;s authors concluded that in subjects with a negative initial screening study, increasing the screening interval from one year might be warranted.</p><p>Fewer stage IV cancers were observed in the LDCT group than the chest radiograph group with the second and third screening rounds, suggesting that diagnosis of earlier-stage cancers reduced the occurrence of later-stage lung cancers. Lung cancers detected by screening were mostly stage I or II (70 percent of CT detected and 56.7 percent of radiograph detected), except for small cell cancers that accounted for less than 10 percent of detected cancers. Chest LDCT identified a preponderance of adenocarcinomas. More detailed results of the first round of screening (T0) in the NLST show that stage I cancer was detected in 158 participants in the LDCT group and 70 participants in the radiograph group; stage IIB to IV cancers were found in 120 versus 112 participants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lung-cancer/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. Thus, the difference in cancer detection between groups was in the increased identification of early-stage cancers with LDCT scan in the first screen. Based on data collected for three years following the screening rounds, sensitivity and specificity were, respectively, 93.8 and 73.4 percent for LDCT and 73.5 and 91.3 percent for radiograph. Additional details about screening rounds 2 and 3 (T1 and T2) and incident lung cancers indicate that 27.9 and 16.8 percent of T1 and T2 LDCT scans, respectively, were positive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lung-cancer/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. The positive predictive value for cancer was 2.4 and 5.2 percent at T1 and T2, respectively. The higher predictive value at T2 was likely related to classification of a nodule that had been stable over three screenings as &quot;negative.&quot; Consistent with results from T0, lung cancers detected by LDCT scan were more likely to be stage 1A (at T1, 47.5 percent of cancers identified by LDCT compared with 23.5 percent of those identified by radiograph).</p><p>Generalizability of these findings may be affected by the following factors: trial participants had a higher education level and were younger than tobacco users identified in United States census data, a low complication rate of follow-up procedures may reflect the expertise at the participating academic centers, and radiologic performance and interpretation may not be representative of community-based radiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lung-cancer/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>].</p><p>Since the control group in the NLST had screening with chest radiograph rather than usual care, findings of the PLCO trial, in which participants were randomly assigned to usual care or annual chest radiography, are pertinent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lung-cancer/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>].

However, the benefits from screening could be improved if it were possible to more precisely identify a high-risk population. Risk prediction models that incorporate factors in addition to smoking have been proposed to better identify high-risk groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lung-cancer/abstract/114-120\" class=\"abstract_t\">114-120</a>]. Prospective studies are needed, however, to determine whether a population can be readily identified using risk models in which screening would have greater benefit than the 20 percent lung cancer-mortality benefit identified in the NLST. In addition, how to implement and operationalize individual risk-based screening remains a major challenge.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There is evidence to suggest that targeting screening to higher-risk individuals could result in greater benefits with lower risks. In a retrospective study using NLST participants, a risk prediction model was used to divide participants into five quintiles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lung-cancer/abstract/121\" class=\"abstract_t\">121</a>]. The study found that 88 percent of the screen-prevented lung cancer deaths occurred among participants in the three highest-risk quintiles, and only 1 percent of prevented deaths occurred in the lowest-risk quintile. A model derived from data from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial incorporates age, education, body mass index (BMI), family history, history of chronic lung disease, and smoking status, and it performed well with external validation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lung-cancer/abstract/119,122\" class=\"abstract_t\">119,122</a>]. A study applying this model to the PLCO and NLST cohorts suggested that smokers age 66 to 80 years would benefit more from screening than those age 55 to 64 years, and that never-smokers would not benefit from screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lung-cancer/abstract/123\" class=\"abstract_t\">123</a>].</p><p/><p>In a subsequent study, an empirical individual risk model incorporating smoking history, family history, presence of lung disease, sex, education, race, and BMI was validated in the PLCO and NLST cohorts and in the United States general population, and compared with US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) and The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) recommendations for screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lung-cancer/abstract/114\" class=\"abstract_t\">114</a>]. The individual risk assessment model improved both effectiveness and efficiency of screening; if the same number of ever-smokers were screened, individual risk-based screening would avert 20 percent more deaths compared with application of the USPSTF criteria. It would also reduce the number needed to screen to prevent a death (NNS) by 17 percent. With this approach, there are USPSTF-ineligible individuals with sufficient lung cancer risk who would benefit from screening, replacing 36 percent of USPSTF-eligible, low-risk individuals who are unlikely to benefit from screening. This strategy also results in increasing the number of African Americans and women recommended for screening.</p><p>As a final example, the Liverpool Lung Project (LLP) risk model incorporates smoking duration, history of pneumonia, history of cancer, family history of lung cancer, and asbestos exposure into a risk score [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lung-cancer/abstract/115\" class=\"abstract_t\">115</a>].

Based on the NLST trial, the cost of screening per life saved is unknown but likely to be high, given the high (approximately 95 percent) false-positive rate leading to the need for additional studies, the need for ongoing screening, and the relatively low absolute number of deaths prevented (73 per 100,000 person years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lung-cancer/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p>Modeling studies will be needed to determine actual cost-effectiveness.

The Cancer Care Ontario Programme (CCOP) issued guidelines in 2013 targeting the same group of patients but suggesting biennial screening after two consecutive years of negative scanning [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lung-cancer/abstract/134\" class=\"abstract_t\">134</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Counseling for screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Any program of lung cancer screening requires more than LDCT capability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lung-cancer/abstract/135,136\" class=\"abstract_t\">135,136</a>]. Screening should only be performed when the clinician and patient are committed to pursuing follow-up investigations, including serial imaging and possible surgical lung biopsy, and where there is expertise in chest radiography and lung cancer management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lung-cancer/abstract/137,138\" class=\"abstract_t\">137,138</a>].</p><p>The National Cancer Institute has developed a <a href=\"http://www.cancer.gov/newscenter/qa/2002/NLSTstudyGuidePatientsPhysicians&amp;token=vOibAgOCriUmibQhldMigeArfvsx5TibcZcZC20mdxV9PaqZLVzhMC+dMDrPOuo1e081rOBnWY/C0u24fyFKLD3ShoZ5tsZDImaIoXnceYQ=&amp;TOPIC_ID=7566\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">guide for patients and clinicians</a> to review the data from the NLST to facilitate communication about the benefits and harms of screening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lung-cancer/abstract/139\" class=\"abstract_t\">139</a>].</p><p>Providers need to be experienced in the principles of screening and the management of small lung nodules. If these components are in place and at-risk individuals (mostly through smoking and occupational exposure) are highly motivated to be screened for lung cancer, the following points should be discussed with the patient before beginning screening. Some have advocated formal informed consent including these points:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Smoking cessation is a more proven and powerful intervention for preventing death and complications from lung cancer and other diseases than screening.

The role of insurance coverage in screening has not been determined following the NLST results, and insurance may not cover the cost of screening. As of February 2015, Medicare will cover low-dose helical CT scanning for asymptomatic patients age 55 to 77 years with a history of smoking at least 30 pack-years and, if a former smoker, having quit within the previous 15 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lung-cancer/abstract/140\" class=\"abstract_t\">140</a>].

In one study, FDG-PET correctly diagnosed 19 of 25 indeterminate nodules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lung-cancer/abstract/141\" class=\"abstract_t\">141</a>]. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of FDG-PET for the diagnosis of malignancy were 69, 91, 90, and 71 percent, respectively. When a negative FDG-PET was followed three months later with a repeat CT, the negative predictive value was 100 percent. If these results are validated by future studies, the simple algorithm employed could have substantial implications for incorporation of PET imaging into large-scale screening programs.

Detection and treatment of small lung tumors (prior to radiographic visualization) may produce superior outcomes, though the possibility of lead-time and other types of bias influencing the assessment of these technologies is great. Outcome benefits must be thoroughly investigated prior to their widespread use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lung-cancer/abstract/143\" class=\"abstract_t\">143</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">These techniques may also help identify people with significantly higher lung cancer risk in whom the likelihood that radiographic studies would detect early-stage lung cancer is increased.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Potential biosamples for biomarker analysis include airway epithelium (including buccal mucosa), sputum, exhaled breath, and blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/screening-for-lung-cancer/abstract/144\" class=\"abstract_t\">144</a>].

VDT correlated with lung cancer mortality rates (9.2 percent per year for fast-growing and 0.9 percent per year for slow-growing or indolent cancers). Ten percent of the cancers identified in the COSMOS cohort had a VDT of 600 days or more, and 25 percent had a VDT of 400 or more days and thus might represent overdiagnosis; such tumors might reasonably be managed with less aggressive intervention.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3112302942\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Prevention (promoting smoking cessation) is likely to have far greater impact on lung cancer mortality than is screening. Nonetheless, lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) has the potential to significantly reduce the burden of lung cancer. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Early trials of chest radiograph screening in males at high risk for lung cancer found no mortality benefit for radiograph alone or radiograph plus sputum cytology. A large randomized trial (the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian [PLCO] Cancer Screening Trial) of single-view chest radiograph in men and women found no decrease in lung cancer incidence or mortality with screening. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Chest radiograph/sputum cytology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LDCT refers to a noncontrast study obtained with a multidetector CT scanner during a single maximal inspiratory breath-hold with a scanning time under 25 seconds. Radiation dose exposure is less than a third of a standard-dose diagnostic chest CT examination. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Low-dose chest CT'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A large randomized trial (National Lung Screening Trial [NLST]) of annual LDCT screening in patients with a 30 pack-year history of smoking, including those who quit smoking in the preceding 15 years, demonstrated a decrease in lung cancer and all-cause mortality. These results have led to revised guidelines from multiple professional organizations. (See <a href=\"#H75373691\" class=\"local\">'National Lung Screening Trial'</a> above and <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Recommendations by expert groups'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All patients who smoke should be strongly counseled to quit smoking, as this is the most effective intervention to reduce the risk of lung cancer. Patients who currently smoke or have a history of smoking should be advised of the risks and benefits of screening for lung cancer (see <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Counseling for screening'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients in good health who are thought to have a risk for lung cancer at least as great as those in the NLST and who have access to centers with radiologic, diagnostic, and treatment capabilities similar to those in the NLST, and for whom the cost of screening is not an issue, we suggest annual screening with low-dose helical CT (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=4\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2A</a>). High-risk criteria for participation in the NLST were age 55 to 74 years, a history of smoking at least 30 pack-years and, if a former smoker, having quit within the previous 15 years. Consistent with modeling studies subsequent to the NLST and with recommendations from the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), we also suggest screening for high-risk patients in good health to age 80 (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For former smokers, annual screening should continue until 15 years has elapsed from the date of smoking cessation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The potential harms associated with LDCT include false-positive imaging requiring follow-up, incidental findings, radiation exposure, anxiety associated with screening and follow-up, and overdiagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H75374308\" class=\"local\">'Potential harms of screening'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Plain chest radiograph screening has been shown to be ineffective for lung cancer screening. We recommend <strong>not</strong> screening for lung cancer with chest radiograph (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>).
