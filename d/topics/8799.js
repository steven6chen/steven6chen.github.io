To meet this goal, pediatric clinicians must know the risk factors for obesity and protein energy malnutrition and must understand the normal and abnormal patterns of growth and the changes in body composition during childhood and adolescence. In addition, they must be able to accurately perform and interpret the results of the nutritional evaluation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-nutritional-assessment-in-childhood/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Nutritional assessment is the quantitative evaluation of nutritional status.

Failure to pay attention to brief episodes of nutritional depletion can lead to a vicious cycle in which the nutritional status of the child worsens with each repeated illness and makes him or her more vulnerable to subsequent infections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Malignancy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of malnutrition among pediatric cancer patients varies widely. Malnutrition is present at diagnosis of cancer in more than 50 percent of children in resource-limited countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-nutritional-assessment-in-childhood/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In resource-rich countries, the prevalence of malnutrition ranges from less than 10 percent in children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia to 50 percent in children with advanced neuroblastoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-nutritional-assessment-in-childhood/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. Furthermore, nutritional status at diagnosis is a predictor of outcomes and quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-nutritional-assessment-in-childhood/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. Cancer treatment can contribute to malnutrition in the short term by inducing anorexia, mucositis, emesis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diarrhea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-nutritional-assessment-in-childhood/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Serial measurements of height, weight, and food intake, as well as measurement of serum albumin and prealbumin, should be standard practice in the care of children with cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-nutritional-assessment-in-childhood/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. </p><p>Children with acute leukemia are at risk for nutritional problems at diagnosis, during treatment, and in long-term follow up. At diagnosis and during treatment they tend to have low rates of undernutrition (typically less than 10 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-nutritional-assessment-in-childhood/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. However, they often gain weight excessively during and after two years of therapy and appear to have an increased risk of becoming obese [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-nutritional-assessment-in-childhood/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. The mechanisms for this association have not been established, but may include reduced habitual physical activity and associated reduced total energy expenditure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-nutritional-assessment-in-childhood/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>], and possibly subtle hypothalamic-pituitary dysfunction induced by cranial radiation therapy (CRT).

In one study, nutrition evaluation was performed in 79 children with moderate to severe motor or cognitive dysfunction who were referred for diagnosis and treatment of feeding or nutritional problems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-nutritional-assessment-in-childhood/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. The primary diagnoses included cerebral palsy with mental retardation, prematurity, chromosomal abnormality, central nervous system (CNS) malformation, congenital infection, pervasive developmental delay, perinatal asphyxia, and fetal alcohol syndrome. The following findings were reported: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Energy intake at the time of entry into the study, determined by dietary recall and three-day food records, was approximately 80 percent of the recommended daily allowance (RDA). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) with or without aspiration was present in 44 of 79 patients, oropharyngeal dysphagia in 21, and aversive feeding behaviors in 14. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After approximately two years of therapy based upon diagnosis (eg, medical treatment of GER, feeding therapy, gastrostomy tube placement), energy intake increased to 123 percent of the RDA. </p><p/><p>The assessment and management of nutritional problems in children with cerebral palsy are discussed in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-prognosis-of-cerebral-palsy#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and prognosis of cerebral palsy&quot;, section on 'Feeding and nutrition'</a>.) </p><p>Paradoxically, there is also a high prevalence of obesity among some populations of children and adults with intellectual disability, particularly those with less severe disabilities and certain specific disorders such as Down syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/indications-for-nutritional-assessment-in-childhood/abstract/42-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-44</a>]. The rates of obesity also vary depending on the country and the clinical setting in which the affected individual lives.

Identifying children with or at risk for nutritional problems is an important part of preventive medical care. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Serial measurements of weight and height are a valuable screen for nutritional problems when compared with expected growth rates for healthy children. The most rapid growth rates in healthy children occur during early infancy and adolescence (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F68720\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68720 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Normal patterns of growth'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) manifests as weight loss in all children. However, the effect of PEM on body composition differs in infants and older children. As the infant becomes malnourished, weight loss occurs, the absolute amount of body fat decreases, and the proportion of body fat relative to body weight decreases markedly. In the older child with chronic disease, the absolute amount of lean body mass generally is reduced to a much greater extent than body fat. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Effect of malnutrition on body composition'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The following growth patterns raise concerns for under-nutrition. In general, deficits in weight gain or body mass index (BMI) raise concerns about acute PEM while deficits in height or height velocity raise concerns about chronic PEM.
