A substantial body of literature about pediatric RLS has emphasized its impact on sleep, as well as frequent comorbidity with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), mood disorders, and anxiety disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-children/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>]. Consensus diagnostic criteria for children were updated in 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-children/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>], and pediatric-specific treatment data are emerging.</p><p>Periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD) is characterized by clinical sleep disturbance and by repetitive limb jerking in sleep (known as periodic limb movements of sleep, PLMS), that is not better explained by another condition, medication use, or substance use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In children, PLMD appears to be closely related to RLS, although they are distinct diagnostic entities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-children/abstract/1,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8,9</a>].</p><p>Because of the similarities of pediatric RLS and PLMD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>], especially overlap in the approach to treatment, they are presented together in this topic review, with important differences noted when applicable.

However, the prevalence of moderate-to-severe or clinically-significant RLS is lower, estimated at 2 to 3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-children/abstract/12-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-16</a>]. The severity of symptoms is directly relevant to clinical care and is an important component of treatment decisions. The prevalence of RLS in most Asian populations is less, with most studies finding overall rates lower than 5 percent, except in Korea where prevalence is similar to Europe and North America [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-children/abstract/10,17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,17-19</a>]. In all ethnic groups, women are affected about twice as often as men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Onset of symptoms prior to age 20 years is reported in approximately 40 percent of adults with RLS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-children/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>].</p><p>The prevalence of RLS in children and adolescents is 2 to 4 percent in population-based studies from the United Kingdom, the United States, Turkey, China, and Brazil, and the prevalence of moderate-to-severe RLS is 0.5 to 1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-children/abstract/23-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-29</a>]. This approaches the prevalence of obstructive sleep apnea in children but exceeds the prevalence of both pediatric epilepsy and diabetes. Boys are affected as often as girls in younger age groups, except in China where there are more females affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-children/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]; the female predominance noted in adults consistently emerges in the mid-to-late teens or early twenties [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-children/abstract/10,23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,23-26</a>].</p><p>Population-based studies of RLS in adults report high incidence rates (annual new cases) of 0.8 to 1.7 percent, as well as high remission rates (about 50 percent of cases) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-children/abstract/30-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-33</a>]. A single pediatric study found similarly high incidence and remission rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-children/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. These findings are in contrast to clinical cohorts, in which remission is much less common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-children/abstract/20,35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,35-37</a>]. As an example, a large study in a clinical cohort reported that RLS was progressive in 36 percent, was stable in 41 percent, diminished in 15 percent, and remitted in 8 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-children/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Together, these observations suggest that mild, non-clinical cases that are captured in population-based studies are more likely to remit spontaneously than are those cases that come to medical attention and that are captured in clinical cohorts. Nonetheless, the potential for remission should be considered when a treatment plan is discussed.</p><p>The epidemiology of periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD) is less understood because no well-constructed studies are available using the more current definition for PLMD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. However, large case series suggest that this diagnosis is not uncommon in pediatric sleep clinics in which children are routinely evaluated for PLMD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-children/abstract/9,39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,39-41</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21806625\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Genetics, brain iron deficiency, and brain dopamine have been implicated in the pathophysiology of restless legs syndrome (RLS) and periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-children/abstract/42-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-46</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A genetic mechanism is suggested by the high familial prevalence (40 to 92 percent) among individuals with RLS onset before age 40 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-children/abstract/36,38,47,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,38,47,48</a>]. Similarly, in a pediatric population-based study, a family history of RLS was reported in 71 percent of affected children between 8 and 11 years and in 80 percent of those between 12 and 17 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-children/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Both parents were affected in 16 percent of these cases. In addition, several genome-wide studies have found an association of RLS with genetic variants of <em>BTBD9, MEIS1,</em> <em>PTPRD, SKOR1, TOX3, </em>and<em> MAP2K5 </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-children/abstract/44,49-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,49-52</a>]. More recently, 13 new risk loci have been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-children/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].

Iron is important in brain dopamine production and synaptic density, as well as in myelin synthesis, in energy production, and, probably, in norepinephrine and serotonin neurotransmitter systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-children/abstract/62-64\" class=\"abstract_t\">62-64</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A role for brain dopaminergic signaling in RLS and PLMS is supported by the efficacy of dopaminergic drugs in treating these disorders, demonstrated in multiple randomized clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-children/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H21806751\" class=\"local\">'Medication'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21806632\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among children presenting to our pediatric sleep and neurology clinic who were ultimately diagnosed with restless legs syndrome (RLS) or periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD), we have observed the following characteristics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]:</p><p>Chief complaint:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep concerns &ndash; 46 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Behavior concerns &ndash; 46 percent</p><p/><p>Sleep problems:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Restless sleep &ndash; 86 percent</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sleep onset problems &ndash; 81 percent.

Sleep maintenance problems are somewhat more common in children diagnosed with PLMD, compared with those with RLS.</p><p/><p>Surprisingly, leg symptoms rarely are the chief complaint. We think this is because parents are more likely to be aware of and concerned about the behavioral impact of these disorders, rather than the more specific leg or limb symptoms. These observations underscore the importance of asking specifically about leg and arm symptoms, if the family does not spontaneously relate concerns. (See <a href=\"#H21806680\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>We also noted a high prevalence of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in this sample (78 percent), which reflects our clinical focus on ADHD. The prevalence of other comorbid conditions probably vary among clinical centers that see children with these disorders. Leg discomfort may be a more common presentation of RLS in a pediatric rheumatology clinic, and limb jerking during sleep may be more common as a presentation of PLMD in an epilepsy clinic.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21806639\"><span class=\"h2\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To evaluate for RLS, the key clinical characteristics that should be elicited by the history are (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F86837\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86837 \">table 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An urge to move the legs, usually accompanied by uncomfortable or unpleasant sensations in the legs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>These symptoms: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>begin or worsen during rest or inactivity (eg, lying down or sitting)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>are relieved by movement</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>occur exclusively or predominantly in the evening or night</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>These symptoms are not solely accounted for by another medical or behavioral condition.</p><p/><p>These symptoms are subjective but follow typical patterns that are described in different ways by children. Therefore, it is important to have the child describe any leg-related symptoms in his or her own words rather than by the parent or caretaker and to make these inquiries with open-ended questions, using age-appropriate vocabulary (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F86838\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86838 \">table 2</a>). Descriptive responses should be encouraged instead of <span class=\"nowrap\">yes/no</span> responses. Sufficient prompts should be used to determine whether RLS diagnostic criteria are met, but, once the child starts describing symptoms, &quot;tell me more&quot; is often the best way to elicit further diagnostic information.</p><p>The interview may start with nonspecific prompts, such as, &quot;How did you sleep last night?&quot;. More specific prompts to assess the urge to move the legs are &quot;Do your legs bother you?&quot;; &quot;Do your legs bother you at night?&quot;; &quot;Do your legs bother you at school?&quot;; and &quot;Do your legs ever hurt?&quot;. It is very uncommon for young children to understand or use the word &quot;urge.&quot; If given the opportunity, most children with RLS will use more than one descriptor for the RLS sensations. Common descriptors used by children are &quot;want to move&quot;; &quot;have to move&quot;; &quot;got to kick&quot;; &quot;bugs&quot;; &quot;ants&quot;; &quot;tingling&quot;; &quot;wiggly&quot;; &quot;itchy&quot;; &quot;pain&quot;; and &quot;hurts&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-children/abstract/8,23,66-68\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,23,66-68</a>]. If &quot;pain&quot; or &quot;hurts&quot; is the initial descriptor, it is important to probe for additional descriptors, since many of the conditions in the differential diagnosis are described as painful but lack additional RLS characteristics. Another helpful prompt to identify discomfort is &quot;Is that a good or a bad feeling?&quot;.</p><p>To identify the temporal characteristics of the symptoms, useful prompts are &quot;What are you doing when you get those feelings?&quot; or &quot;Do you get those feelings more during the day or at night?&quot;. To probe for relief with movement, a useful prompt is &quot;When you move your legs are the feelings better, worse, or about the same?&quot;.</p><p>An additional technique that we find useful diagnostically is having the child make a drawing of symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F87631\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87631 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F87694\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef87694 \">figure 2</a>). We have found that children will often talk about their RLS symptoms in detail if they are asked to draw a picture of the feelings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-children/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p>Finally, the clinical significance of RLS or PLMD is determined by assessing for significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, educational, or other important areas of functioning. Parental input is helpful in this assessment. The impact of the symptoms on sleep, mood, and schoolwork are typically the focus of concerns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-children/abstract/23,28,29,69,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,28,29,69,70</a>].</p><p>PLMD is characterized by repetitive limb jerking in sleep, in association with clinical disturbance of sleep or impaired daytime function that cannot be accounted for by another sleep disorder or etiology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The possibility of PLMD may be raised by the history but must be confirmed by polysomnography because parental or child observations for periodic limb movements of sleep (PLMS) are not reliable for diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-children/abstract/8,9,71-73\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9,71-73</a>]. Parents report children with PLMD as &quot;restless in sleep&quot; in 70 to 90 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-children/abstract/9,39,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,39,71</a>]. However, this descriptor is not specific for PLMD and can be seen in a similar percentage of children with obstructive sleep apnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-children/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Observed &quot;leg kicking in sleep&quot; is reported in 40 to 50 percent but also has a low specificity. Conversely, absence of restless sleep and of leg kicking in sleep has a high negative predictive value. Other findings that can raise the index of suspicion for PLMD include a family history of RLS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-children/abstract/9,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,39</a>], a personal history of some but not full diagnostic criteria for RLS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-children/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>], and a history of frequent parasomnias, such as confusional arousals, sleep terrors, or sleepwalking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-children/abstract/9,39,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,39,75</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6963820\"><span class=\"h2\">Polysomnography and accelerometry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For PLMD, polysomnography is essential for diagnosis and helps to rule out sleep apnea as the etiology for leg movements. Polysomnography should be considered for children with clinical sleep disturbance (for which another cause is not evident) and with a history suggestive of PLMD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-children/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. </p><p>Night-to-night variability of periodic limb movements of sleep (PLMS) can complicate the assessment by polysomnography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-children/abstract/77-81\" class=\"abstract_t\">77-81</a>]. Therefore, in cases in which we have a high index of suspicion for PLMD and in which polysomnography is negative for PLMS, we monitor for PLMS by five nights of ankle accelerometry [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-children/abstract/78,82,83\" class=\"abstract_t\">78,82,83</a>]. In the scoring of pediatric PLMS, it should be appreciated that the intermovement intervals may be quite variable, resulting in irregular appearing clusters, as shown in the bottom panel of the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F87701\" class=\"graphic graphic_waveform graphicRef87701 \">waveform 1</a>), rather than the highly stereotyped &quot;runs&quot; seen in adult RLS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-children/abstract/84-87\" class=\"abstract_t\">84-87</a>]. Of note, periodic limb movements of sleep (PLMS) greater than five per hour are usually abnormal in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-children/abstract/84,88-92\" class=\"abstract_t\">84,88-92</a>]. An exception is normal 3 to 5 year olds at high altitude, who were found to have a mean PLMS index of 10.1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-children/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. Also, new evidence suggests slightly higher normative values for children one to five years of age, with PLMS during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep contributing to the increase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-children/abstract/94\" class=\"abstract_t\">94</a>]. In contrast, PLMS greater than five per hour are common in apparently asymptomatic adults over age 40 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-children/abstract/95,96\" class=\"abstract_t\">95,96</a>]. Interestingly, the cardiovascular lability associated with PLMS in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-children/abstract/97,98\" class=\"abstract_t\">97,98</a>] has also been found in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-children/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>]. PLMS typically occur during stage N1 and N2 sleep, decrease in frequency in stage N3, and are usually absent during REM (also known as stage R) sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/restless-legs-syndrome-and-periodic-limb-movement-disorder-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6963429\"><span class=\"h2\">Iron deficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Iron deficiency is associated with both RLS and PLMD, and iron supplementation improves symptoms in a subset of patients. Therefore, laboratory evidence of iron deficiency supports the diagnosis of RLS or PLMD. However, iron deficiency is neither necessary nor sufficient to make the diagnosis of RLS or PLMD because each of these disorders is of a multifactorial etiology.

Because RLS is highly familial, the entire family may benefit from effective treatment for an affected parent. Furthermore, parents often need specific guidance to help the child establish and maintain a good sleep schedule to minimize RLS and PLMD symptoms. As adolescence approaches, it is important to foster self-awareness and self-management skills.

It is characterized by an urge to move the legs, usually accompanied by uncomfortable or unpleasant sensations in the legs. The symptoms begin or worsen during rest or inactivity, are relieved by movement, and occur exclusively or predominantly in the evening or night (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F86837\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86837 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H21806687\" class=\"local\">'Restless legs syndrome'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of RLS is based primarily upon the history, which must be carefully targeted to capture relevant information from the patient (rather than just the parent). Other causes of similar symptoms should be considered and excluded (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F86840\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86840 \">table 4</a>). (See <a href=\"#H21806639\" class=\"local\">'History'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1419667\" class=\"local\">'Restless legs symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Periodic limb movement disorder (PLMD) is characterized by repetitive limb movements during sleep (known as periodic limb movements of sleep; PLMS), in association with clinical disturbance of sleep or impaired daytime function that cannot be accounted for by another sleep disorder or etiology. The diagnosis is established by documenting abnormal numbers of PLMS during polysomnography and by ruling out other causes for the symptoms, including RLS and obstructive sleep apnea (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F86839\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef86839 \">table 3</a>). (See <a href=\"#H6963820\" class=\"local\">'Polysomnography and accelerometry'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1419761\" class=\"local\">'Leg movements during sleep'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In children, RLS is closely related to PLMD, although they are distinct diagnostic entities. PLMS are central to the diagnosis of PLMD but also are a common and supportive finding in RLS. Both conditions have been associated with relative iron deficiency and have a familial tendency. (See <a href=\"#H21806625\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Conditions associated with RLS and PLMD include attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), depression, and anxiety. Recognition of these comorbid conditions is important to treatment decisions. (See <a href=\"#H21806716\" class=\"local\">'Comorbidity'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1417583\" class=\"local\">'Special populations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management of pediatric RLS is summarized in the algorithm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F99432\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef99432 \">algorithm 1</a>), and includes the following: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Iron status should be evaluated for all children with suspected or established RLS or PLMD because of the association between these disorders and iron deficiency. A serum ferritin level of 50 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/L</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">(ng/mL)</span> is optimal. For children with ferritin levels below this range, we suggest iron supplementation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H6965168\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory tests'</a> above and <a href=\"#H21806744\" class=\"local\">'Iron supplementation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Factors that may exacerbate RLS or PLMD include insufficient sleep, irregular sleep, obstructive sleep apnea, pain, caffeine, nicotine, and some medications, including sedating antihistamines, serotonergic antidepressants, and dopamine blockers. (See <a href=\"#H21806737\" class=\"local\">'Exacerbating factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Establishing healthy sleep habits is an important aspect of a comprehensive treatment plan for RLS or PLMD (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F52760\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52760 \">table 5</a>). Regular physical activity also may be helpful. In milder cases, these interventions alone can be sufficient. (See <a href=\"#H21806730\" class=\"local\">'Nonpharmacologic interventions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For pediatric RLS, we generally emphasize nonpharmacologic interventions for mild cases and reserve medication for chronic, moderate-to-severe cases in a setting of long-term specialty care. For children six years and older with RLS who require pharmacotherapy, we suggest <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">gabapentin</a> as a first-line medication, rather than dopamine agonists or benzodiazepines (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Other considerations that affect choice of treatment include the severity of symptoms, the type of sleep disturbance (sleep onset or sleep maintenance), and the presence of comorbid depression, anxiety, or ADHD.
