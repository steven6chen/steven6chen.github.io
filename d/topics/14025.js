In a phase III trial, over 700 patients with stage III NSCLC without progression after at least two cycles of platinum-based chemoradiotherapy were randomly assigned to the programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibody <a href=\"topic.htm?path=durvalumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">durvalumab</a> or to placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practice-changing-updates/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Durvalumab increased the median duration of progression-free survival (16.8 versus 5.6 months), with comparable rates of severe adverse events. Overall survival results are immature. In February 2018, based on these data, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of durvalumab for patients with unresectable stage III NSCLC whose disease has not progressed following concurrent platinum-based chemoradiotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practice-changing-updates/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>], and we now suggest its use in this setting. However, some experts may reasonably opt to avoid this additional treatment, given the lack of mature overall survival data and the potential for toxicity associated with immunotherapy.

We suggest RZV rather than ZVL for most patients who meet criteria for vaccination. RZV appears to provide greater protection against herpes zoster, and there is less concern for waning immunity. The choice of RZV as the preferred type of vaccine is consistent with recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practice-changing-updates/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Disadvantages of RZV are the need for two doses (versus one with ZVL), and an increased risk of mild to moderate side effects (pain at the injection site, myalgia, fatigue, headache, fever) that typically resolve in one to three days. These factors rarely prevent patients from completing the RZV series. For patients who previously received ZVL, we suggest revaccination with RZV. The optimal use of RZV in immunocompromised patients is still to be determined.

Rhythm control can be achieved with medical therapy (eg, antiarrhythmic drugs) or catheter ablation (CA). The strongest evidence supporting the use of CA in many of these patients comes from the CASTLE-AF randomized trial that compared CA with medical therapy (rate or rhythm control) in 363 patients with symptomatic paroxysmal or persistent AF; New York Heart Association class II, III, or IV HF; a left ventricular ejection fraction of &le;35 percent; failure or unwillingness to take antiarrhythmic drug therapy; and an implanted cardioverter-defibrillator [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practice-changing-updates/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

We are in agreement with this approach, which is supported by a study performed during a mumps outbreak at a university with over 20,000 enrolled students [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/practice-changing-updates/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Almost all students had previously received two MMR doses; nearly 5000 received a third dose following the outbreak onset. In an adjusted analysis, the third MMR dose was associated with a 60 percent lower risk of mumps at seven days after vaccination. In subgroup analysis, the mumps attack rate was lowest for students who had received their second dose of MMR within two years of the outbreak, compared with those who completed the two-dose MMR series more than two years earlier. Given that the benefit of a third MMR dose increases with time since receipt of the second MMR dose, it is reasonable to prioritize booster vaccination to those who have had longer intervals since their previous MMR immunization.

Eltrombopag plus IST produced higher rates of overall hematologic response at six months compared with responses in a historical cohort (80 to 94 percent versus 66 percent for the historical group). Based on these findings, we now suggest administration of eltrombopag plus IST for individuals with acquired severe AA who are not candidates for allogeneic HCT.

Compared with placebo, ocrelizumab modestly reduced the proportion of patients with disability progression at 24 weeks (30 versus 36 percent). In addition, ocrelizumab slowed deterioration from baseline to week 120 on the timed 25-foot walk and led to improvements on other endpoints. While the long-term risks of infection and neoplasm with ocrelizumab are uncertain, there are no other disease-modifying therapies for PPMS. Therefore, we suggest treatment with ocrelizumab for most patients with PPMS. Ocrelizumab has also been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for use in relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), although its role in the early treatment of this form of the disease remains to be determined.
