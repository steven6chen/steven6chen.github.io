In a population-based series from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, the average annual incidence of RPS was approximately 2.7 cases per million population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-treatment-of-retroperitoneal-soft-tissue-sarcoma/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Patients usually present in their 50s, although the age range is broad [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-treatment-of-retroperitoneal-soft-tissue-sarcoma/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. The frequency is approximately equal in men and women.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY, HISTOLOGY, AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The retroperitoneum is defined anteriorly by the peritoneal extensions anchoring the transverse colon, the small bowel, and the ascending and descending colon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-treatment-of-retroperitoneal-soft-tissue-sarcoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The posterior aspect of this space is a muscular wall comprising the psoas major and minor, the quadratus lumborum, the obturator internus, the pyriformis muscle, and the tendinous portion of the transversus abdominis muscle. The retroperitoneum is bordered superiorly by the diaphragm, inferiorly by the levator ani muscles, and laterally by the ascending and descending colon in combination with the peripheral margin of the quadratus lumborum muscles.</p><p>Approximately 80 percent of the neoplasms that arise within the retroperitoneal space are malignant. Furthermore, the majority of patients who present with a primary retroperitoneal, extravisceral, unifocal soft tissue mass will be found to have a sarcoma.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Histologic types</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In adults, the most common histologic types of RPS are liposarcoma and leiomyosarcoma, followed by <span class=\"nowrap\">undifferentiated/unclassified</span> soft tissue sarcoma (STS; a subset of which are pleomorphic undifferentiated sarcomas). Historically, <span class=\"nowrap\">undifferentiated/unclassified</span> STS were included within the older term &quot;malignant fibrous histiocytoma.&quot; A variety of other histologic types may be observed, but they are much less common in the retroperitoneum than in other primary sites. Approximately one-half of all RPS are high-grade tumors, although this varies according to histology. The majority of retroperitoneal liposarcomas are low- to intermediate-grade lesions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-histopathology-diagnostic-evaluation-and-staging-of-soft-tissue-sarcoma#H12227072\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, histopathology, diagnostic evaluation, and staging of soft tissue sarcoma&quot;, section on 'Histopathology'</a>.)</p><p>Among children, the most common histologic types of RPS are extraskeletal Ewing <span class=\"nowrap\">sarcoma/primitive</span> neuroectodermal tumor (PNET), alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma, and fibrosarcoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-treatment-of-retroperitoneal-soft-tissue-sarcoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The remainder of this review will focus on the tumor types that are most common in adults.

Myxoid, round cell, and pleomorphic liposarcomas are uncommonly found in the retroperitoneum.</p><p>Microscopically, well-differentiated liposarcomas consist of a background of adipocytes that contain scattered lipoblasts, each with a single atypical nucleus surrounded by large intracytoplasmic vacuoles. There is often an inflammatory cell infiltrate. Hypercellular well-differentiated liposarcomas may be confused with dedifferentiated liposarcomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-treatment-of-retroperitoneal-soft-tissue-sarcoma/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Well-differentiated liposarcomas have no potential to metastasize; as such, they are referred to as atypical lipomatous tumors when they arise in the extremity or body <span class=\"nowrap\">wall/trunk</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-treatment-of-retroperitoneal-soft-tissue-sarcoma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, given their propensity for local recurrence in the <span class=\"nowrap\">retroperitoneum/mediastinum</span> and spermatic cord, these same tumors are referred to as well-differentiated liposarcomas in these locations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-treatment-of-retroperitoneal-soft-tissue-sarcoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Dedifferentiated liposarcomas are defined by the presence of sharply demarcated regions of nonlipogenic sarcomatous tissue within a well-differentiated tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-treatment-of-retroperitoneal-soft-tissue-sarcoma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. They may be difficult to distinguish from <span class=\"nowrap\">undifferentiated/unclassified</span> &quot;pleomorphic&quot; sarcomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-treatment-of-retroperitoneal-soft-tissue-sarcoma/abstract/9,11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11-13</a>].</p><p>Well-differentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcomas have morphologic and cytogenetic similarities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-treatment-of-retroperitoneal-soft-tissue-sarcoma/abstract/9,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,14</a>] but significantly different biologic behavior. Dedifferentiated liposarcomas are high-grade tumors. Compared with well-differentiated low-grade liposarcomas, they have higher local recurrence rates, the potential to metastasize (20 to 30 percent distant recurrence rate versus 0 percent for well-differentiated liposarcomas), and a sixfold higher risk of death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-treatment-of-retroperitoneal-soft-tissue-sarcoma/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. It is thought that high-grade dedifferentiated liposarcomas arise from well-differentiated liposarcomas and that well-differentiated liposarcomas can recur as the more aggressive dedifferentiated subtype.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Leiomyosarcomas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Leiomyosarcomas of the retroperitoneum generally arise from the inferior vena cava, its branches, or any small vessel. They often present as a mass or, occasionally, with unilateral or bilateral leg swelling, and they are usually of a large size when diagnosed.</p><p>The clinical issues presented by a large leiomyosarcoma differ from those of a <span class=\"nowrap\">well-differentiated/dedifferentiated</span> liposarcoma. Lung (more than liver) metastases are sometimes observed at the time of presentation or appear relatively quickly after diagnosis. Leiomyosarcomas may also arise from the wall of the gastrointestinal tract or from the uterus. In this situation, they are visceral rather than retroperitoneal, and they have a greater risk of peritoneal spread and metastasis to the liver. For these reasons, follow-up after complete resection of a leiomyosarcoma of the abdomen or retroperitoneum should involve imaging of the chest as well as the abdomen and pelvis on a regular schedule, as noted for other RPS. (See <a href=\"#H2309811992\" class=\"local\">'Posttreatment follow-up'</a> below.)</p><p>Other less common histologic types include malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, undifferentiated sarcoma, synovial sarcoma, solitary fibrous tumor, and desmoplastic small round cell tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-treatment-of-retroperitoneal-soft-tissue-sarcoma/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

Neoplasms originating in the duodenum, pancreas, adrenal glands, or kidney can usually be distinguished from extravisceral retroperitoneal soft tissue masses based upon radiographic appearance. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-staging-of-testicular-germ-cell-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and staging of testicular germ cell tumors&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=extragonadal-germ-cell-tumors-involving-the-mediastinum-and-retroperitoneum\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Extragonadal germ cell tumors involving the mediastinum and retroperitoneum&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other benign and malignant tumors, such as schwannomas and paragangliomas, should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a retroperitoneal mass, particularly one located in the midline adjacent to the aorta or vena cava.</p><p>Two typically benign processes, Castleman disease (angiofollicular lymph node hyperplasia) and retroperitoneal fibrosis, arise within the retroperitoneum and can mimic STS both clinically and radiographically. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=unicentric-castlemans-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Unicentric Castleman's disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-retroperitoneal-fibrosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of retroperitoneal fibrosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RPS typically produce few symptoms until they are large enough to compress or invade surrounding structures. Most cases come to medical attention as an incidentally discovered abdominal mass in an asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic patient. Most tumors are already large and locally advanced at the time they are first detected (median size at diagnosis is approximately 15 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-treatment-of-retroperitoneal-soft-tissue-sarcoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]).</p><p>Some patients present with pain or signs <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> symptoms that are related to mass effect of the tumor on surrounding structures. Local invasion or compression of retroperitoneal neurovascular structures can result in lower extremity edema and neurologic or musculoskeletal symptoms that may be referred to the lower extremities. Gastrointestinal symptoms, such as early satiety, obstruction, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bleeding, can also occur.</p><p>Serous ascites due to portal vein compression has been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-treatment-of-retroperitoneal-soft-tissue-sarcoma/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. Rarely, patients with high-grade, rapidly expanding tumors may experience flu-like symptoms and present with fevers and leukocytosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-treatment-of-retroperitoneal-soft-tissue-sarcoma/abstract/18,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,20</a>].</p><p>Rarely, leiomyosarcomas present with paraneoplastic hypoglycemia, which is usually secondary to tumor production of &quot;big&quot; insulin-like growth factor II [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-treatment-of-retroperitoneal-soft-tissue-sarcoma/abstract/18,19,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19,21</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonislet-cell-tumor-hypoglycemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonislet cell tumor hypoglycemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Distant metastases (most commonly to the lung and liver) are present at the time of diagnosis in approximately 10 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-treatment-of-retroperitoneal-soft-tissue-sarcoma/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION AND STAGING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given that lymphomas and germ cell tumors may occasionally present as a retroperitoneal mass, the initial history should always include questions as to symptoms related to lymphoma (eg, fever, night sweats, weight loss). The physical examination should include palpation of all nodal basins and, in men, a careful testicular examination. A normal testicular exam does not exclude the diagnosis of testicular cancer metastatic to the retroperitoneal nodes; thus, an ultrasound of the testicles should be strongly considered in the evaluation of a young man with a newly diagnosed retroperitoneal mass.</p><p>Laboratory studies should include measurement of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH; an elevated level may be suggestive of lymphoma), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), and beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (beta-hCG; which if elevated, raises the suspicion for a germ cell tumor).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Radiographic evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Radiographic imaging is a key component of the evaluation of a patient with a retroperitoneal mass. The preferred diagnostic studies are a contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis to evaluate the primary site as well as a chest CT to rule out metastatic disease to the lungs. The lungs are the first site of metastasis in the majority of cases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-histopathology-diagnostic-evaluation-and-staging-of-soft-tissue-sarcoma#H12227107\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, histopathology, diagnostic evaluation, and staging of soft tissue sarcoma&quot;, section on 'Pattern of spread'</a>.)</p><p>In most cases, CT is less sensitive to motion artifact than magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and it better defines the anatomic relationship of the tumor to other abdominal organs. It can also detect metastasis to the liver or peritoneum. The radiographic appearance of the primary tumor on a CT scan can also offer clues as to the histologic subtype and grade, which may guide decisions as to the need for a pretreatment biopsy as well as treatment. </p><p>MRI with gadolinium is reserved for patients with an allergy to iodinated contrast agents or if there is equivocal muscle, bone, or foraminal involvement on CT. MRI may also be useful for delineating disease in the pelvis. For patients in whom preoperative radiation therapy is being considered, MRI is useful for assessing local tumor extent and surrounding edema, which are optimally included in the treatment volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-treatment-of-retroperitoneal-soft-tissue-sarcoma/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

PET scanning can achieve whole body imaging, and it is widely considered to be more sensitive than CT for the detection of occult distant metastases in a variety of solid tumors. One reported benefit in sarcomas is to detect sites of extrapulmonary metastatic disease. However, the risk is so low with most soft tissue sarcomas (STS) that routine use of PET for this purpose is unlikely to change the therapeutic plan. As a result, neither PET nor integrated <span class=\"nowrap\">PET/CT</span> is routinely recommended as a component of the initial staging evaluation for STS, including those arising in the retroperitoneum.

The need for and scope of surgery can vary dramatically based upon histology, and this information can be vital in terms of developing a rational multidisciplinary approach to the patient, which may entail referral to a center specializing in the treatment of the given tumor. </p><p>A biopsy is clearly indicated if the diagnosis is in doubt or if preoperative (neoadjuvant) therapy is planned (eg, for a locally advanced unresectable lesion or in the case of radiographic suspicion of focal dedifferentiation [eg, focal <span class=\"nowrap\">nodular/water</span> density areas within an otherwise fat-containing retroperitoneal mass] [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-treatment-of-retroperitoneal-soft-tissue-sarcoma/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]). At least some data support the view that percutaneous core needle biopsy of RPS is safe and does not increase the risk of local recurrence or adversely impact overall survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-treatment-of-retroperitoneal-soft-tissue-sarcoma/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>]. Tumor seeding of the biopsy tract is rare (only 2 suspected out of 547 cases in one report [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-treatment-of-retroperitoneal-soft-tissue-sarcoma/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]). (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Preoperative therapy for large high-grade or locally advanced tumors'</a> below.)</p><p>However, initial surgery without biopsy is an acceptable alternative if the radiographic diagnosis is likely benign lipoma or well-differentiated liposarcoma, or when the diagnosis of STS seems certain based on cross-sectional imaging and the patient is not a candidate for preoperative therapy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Staging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>RPS are staged using the tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) system as defined by the combined American Joint Committee on Cancer <span class=\"nowrap\">(AJCC)/Union</span> for International Cancer Control (UICC). The most recent (eighth edition, 2017) version has separate T stage classifications and prognostic stage groupings for RPS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F110713\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110713 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-treatment-of-retroperitoneal-soft-tissue-sarcoma/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>The earlier (seventh edition) AJCC staging system for STS at all sites was not in widespread use for RPS because it did not account for the prognostic importance of disease site or histology, two major prognostic indicators. In addition, its ability to discriminate outcome was limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-treatment-of-retroperitoneal-soft-tissue-sarcoma/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Several studies have found no prognostic role for tumor size in RPS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-treatment-of-retroperitoneal-soft-tissue-sarcoma/abstract/3,4,11,12,31-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4,11,12,31-33</a>]. Furthermore, most patients with resectable RPS present with large lesions (T2 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F66617\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66617 \">table 2</a>)) without nodal or distant metastases.

Surgical resection has traditionally been the only potentially curative approach. Because of the typically large size and anatomic complexity of these tumors at diagnosis, a complete resection with microscopically negative margins (R0 resection) is often not achieved, and locoregional recurrence is common, especially for low-grade tumors. Yet, the role of adjunctive therapy (radiation therapy [RT], chemotherapy; either given preoperatively or postoperatively) continues to be debated, and there is no consensus as to the best approach for all patients. </p><p>Due to the rarity of these tumors and the complexity of treatment, evaluation and management should ideally be carried out in a center with multidisciplinary expertise in the treatment of sarcomas. The multidisciplinary team approach by dedicated subspecialists optimizes treatment planning, minimizes the duplication of diagnostic studies, reduces the time to implementation of the definitive therapeutic protocol, and improves clinical outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-treatment-of-retroperitoneal-soft-tissue-sarcoma/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. </p><p>However, even among centers of excellence, there is widespread disagreement as to the optimal way to approach RPS and a lack of high-level evidence to support any approach. This is reflected in the widely disparate recommendations from expert groups. Neither the <a href=\"https://www.nccn.org/professionals/physician_gls/default.aspx&amp;token=oGWrlxnXv58O6Xy/JnLCfApxYzrnXi0kiSzt1Mg9KitbaDP6PZOikSjltTXFz1UpHD66kSctLbsuo389nJkOnAq+xKVcSlXG3YebgGzp7ic=&amp;TOPIC_ID=7736\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)</a> nor the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-treatment-of-retroperitoneal-soft-tissue-sarcoma/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>] provides guidance in selecting treatment for individual patients with RPS. However, guidelines from ESMO do mention chemotherapy as an appropriate option for chemosensitive histologies, such as synovial sarcoma, and choosing RT for solitary fibrous tumor due to its radiosensitivity. (See <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Recommendations from expert groups'</a> below.) </p><p>There are many acceptable treatment alternatives. We tend to base our treatment approach on an assessment of resectability and the likely pattern of recurrence:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For all patients, we suggest participation in ongoing clinical trials, where available. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If protocol therapy is not available or the patient is not eligible, our approach differs based upon grade and histology:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For treatment of well-differentiated liposarcoma with no areas concerning for higher grade histology on imaging, our approach differs by tumor size. Initial surgery is reasonable for most patients with a small potentially resectable tumor. For larger tumors, we tend to treat aggressively with therapies that optimize local control (ie, preoperative RT and radical surgery) because these patients tend to die from local recurrence and not distant disease, unless they dedifferentiate. There are no data to provide evidence-based guidelines on the appropriate tumor size to consider for initial surgery, and decision making must be individualized.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients with intermediate- and high-grade tumors with histologies that are chemotherapy sensitive (eg, synovial sarcoma, <span class=\"nowrap\">myxoid/round</span> cell liposarcoma) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> when the risk of distant metastatic disease is high (eg, leiomyosarcoma of the inferior vena cava or large dedifferentiated liposarcoma), we tend to favor neoadjuvant chemotherapy, with or without preoperative RT.

(See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Management of microscopically positive margins'</a> below and <a href=\"#H479112863\" class=\"local\">'Adjuvant radiation therapy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Following an R2 resection, residual tumor frequently abuts structures or organs that cannot be easily or safely resected. For these patients, a small-field postoperative boost dose of RT is a reasonable approach if bowel and other dose-limiting normal tissues can be adequately spared (which might require placement of omentum or a tissue spacer at the time of surgery to displace bowel from the area of residual tumor). Another option, if the surgeon anticipates a grossly incomplete resection, is intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) for an additional dose of 10 to 15 Gy to areas of residual microscopic or gross disease.

The usual reasons for unresectability are extensive vascular involvement or the presence of multiple peritoneal implants. (See <a href=\"#H2429218098\" class=\"local\">'Criteria for unresectability'</a> above.)</p><p>The primary oncologic goal is R0 resection. However, the large size of most RPS, coupled with the inability to obtain wide margins due to anatomic constraints, makes this goal difficult to achieve. In clinical practice, many resections are grossly complete but with microscopically positive margins (R1 resection, termed a &quot;complete resection&quot; in many literature reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-treatment-of-retroperitoneal-soft-tissue-sarcoma/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>]). In a review of four large series of patients with RPS from institutions with extensive experience in management of this disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-treatment-of-retroperitoneal-soft-tissue-sarcoma/abstract/3-5,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5,42</a>], complete resection rates were between 50 and 67 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-treatment-of-retroperitoneal-soft-tissue-sarcoma/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

Guidelines are available from two consensus groups that attempt to standardize the approach to front-line extended surgery for RPS in order to optimize outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-treatment-of-retroperitoneal-soft-tissue-sarcoma/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>].</p><p>The same surgical considerations apply to RPS that involves or originates from major blood vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-evaluation-and-treatment-of-retroperitoneal-soft-tissue-sarcoma/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].

The most common histologic types are liposarcoma and leiomyosarcoma. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Anatomy, histology, and differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>RPS typically produce few symptoms until they are large enough to compress or invade surrounding structures; most commonly, they are discovered in asymptomatic patients as an incidental abdominal mass. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The preferred diagnostic workup is a computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis to evaluate the primary site and a chest CT to rule out metastatic disease to the lungs. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is reserved for patients with an allergy to iodinated contrast agents, in cases where there is equivocal muscle, bone, or foraminal involvement on CT, for pelvic tumors, and if preoperative radiation therapy (RT) is being considered. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Radiographic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinicians should have a low threshold to proceed with a percutaneous core needle biopsy as the very small risk of complications and the unsubstantiated fear of tumor seeding of the biopsy tract are far outweighed by the information obtained from the biopsy. A preoperative biopsy is always indicated if the diagnosis is in doubt, if preoperative therapy is being considered as an alternative to upfront surgery, or if the lesion is suspected of having a high-grade component based upon the results of cross-sectional imaging. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Need for biopsy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is no &quot;one size fits all&quot; approach to treatment of RPS. Surgical resection has traditionally been the only potentially curative approach. Because of the typically large size and anatomic complexity of these tumors at diagnosis, a complete resection with microscopically negative margins (R0 resection) is often not achieved, and locoregional recurrence is common, especially for low-grade tumors. Yet, the role of adjunctive therapy (RT, chemotherapy; either given preoperatively or postoperatively) continues to be debated, and there is no consensus as to the best approach for all patients. (See <a href=\"#H2197191463\" class=\"local\">'Overview of the approach to multidisciplinary treatment'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Due to the rarity of these tumors and the complexity of treatment, evaluation and management should ideally be carried out in a center with multidisciplinary expertise in the treatment of sarcomas. However, even among centers of excellence, there is widespread disagreement as to the optimal way to approach RPS and a lack of high-level evidence to support any approach. This is reflected in the disparate recommendations from expert groups. (See <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Recommendations from expert groups'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are many acceptable treatment alternatives. We tend to base our treatment approach on an assessment of resectability and the likely pattern of recurrence:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For all patients, we suggest participation in ongoing clinical trials, where available. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If protocol therapy is not available or the patient is not eligible, our approach differs depending on grade and histology:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>For treatment of well-differentiated liposarcoma with no areas concerning for higher grade histology on imaging, our approach differs by tumor size. Initial surgery is reasonable for most patients with a small potentially resectable tumor. For larger tumors, we tend to treat aggressively with therapies that optimize local control (ie, preoperative RT and radical surgery) because these patents tend to die from local recurrence and not distant disease, unless they dedifferentiate. There are no data to provide evidence-based guidelines on the appropriate tumor size to consider for initial surgery, and decision making must be individualized. In this setting, we suggest RT alone rather than chemoradiotherapy, unless the patient is being treated in the context of a clinical trial (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Radiation therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Concurrent chemoradiotherapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Surgical resection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>For patients with intermediate- and high-grade tumors with histologies that are chemotherapy sensitive (eg, synovial sarcoma, <span class=\"nowrap\">myxoid/round</span> cell liposarcoma) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> when the risk of distant metastatic disease is high (eg, leiomyosarcoma of the inferior vena cava or large dedifferentiated liposarcoma), we tend to favor neoadjuvant chemotherapy, with or without preoperative RT. The choice of chemotherapy regimen should be based upon the results of small series in which preoperative chemotherapy was used for patients with RPS. Benefit of histology-driven treatment has not been shown in any localized STS, including RPS. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Chemotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>For intermediate- and high-grade tumors with histologies that are not chemotherapy sensitive <span class=\"nowrap\">(and/or</span> if the patient is not a suitable candidate for chemotherapy), we offer preoperative RT (without chemotherapy) and radical surgery. In this setting, we suggest RT alone rather than chemoradiotherapy, unless the patient is being treated in the context of a clinical trial (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Radiation therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Concurrent chemoradiotherapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Although not used in the United States, preoperative regional hyperthermia with systemic chemotherapy is another option for high-risk primary tumors in parts of the world where it is available (mainly Germany). Whether this approach is superior to surgery plus preoperative RT will require a randomized trial. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'With regional hyperthermia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Debulking surgery (ie, partial resection of a tumor leaving behind grossly positive margins [R2 resection]) should be avoided for most patients, with the possible exception of large unresectable well-differentiated liposarcomas, for which palliative debulking surgery may improve symptoms and prolong survival. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Role of debulking surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The use of adjuvant therapy following resection of an RPS without neoadjuvant therapy largely depends on the tumor grade and completeness of resection:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Following resection of an RPS without neoadjuvant therapy, we do not suggest adjuvant RT for a low-grade, completely resected (margin-negative) tumor (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Postoperative RT could be considered for patients with grossly completely resected <span class=\"nowrap\">(R0/R1)</span> high- or intermediate-grade tumors that are at risk for local recurrence; however, in practice, most patients are just observed because it is rarely possible to deliver postoperative adjuvant RT with acceptable morbidity. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Management of microscopically positive margins'</a> above and <a href=\"#H479112863\" class=\"local\">'Adjuvant radiation therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Following an R2 resection, a small-field postoperative boost dose of RT is a reasonable approach if bowel and other dose-limiting normal tissues can be adequately spared (which might require placement of omentum or a tissue spacer at the time of surgery to displace bowel from the area of residual tumor). Another option, if the surgeon anticipates a grossly incomplete resection, is intraoperative radiation therapy (IORT) for an additional dose of 10 to 15 Gy to areas of residual microscopic or gross disease. (See <a href=\"#H479112863\" class=\"local\">'Adjuvant radiation therapy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Role of intraoperative radiation therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent3\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#45;</span>Adjuvant chemotherapy cannot be considered a standard approach for STS at any site, including the retroperitoneum, and we do not suggest its use outside of the context of a clinical trial (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H26\" class=\"local\">'Adjuvant chemotherapy'</a> above.). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The main prognostic factors for long-term outcome are resectability, histologic grade of differentiation, and histologic subtype.
