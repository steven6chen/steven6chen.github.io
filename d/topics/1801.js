Studies comparing BAL cellular constituents to cells obtained from open lung biopsy have shown that the cell types and their state of activation are similar with either collection method.</p><p>This review will consider the basic principles and technique of BAL. The utility of this procedure in individual diseases is discussed in the appropriate topic reviews. The use of preprocedure medication, topical anesthesia of the upper airway, and techniques for the passage of the bronchoscope into the lung are discussed elsewhere.

Advantages with this technique include its noninvasive nature and ability to readily sample alveolar contents.</p><p>As a result, it has an important role in management of diffuse lung diseases for the following reasons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-and-technique-of-bronchoalveolar-lavage/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is an excellent method to obtain specimens to rule out opportunistic infections in immunocompromised hosts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-and-technique-of-bronchoalveolar-lavage/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It can provide clues to the correct diagnosis of certain diseases (eg, acute eosinophilic pneumonia and diffuse alveolar hemorrhage) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=idiopathic-acute-eosinophilic-pneumonia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Idiopathic acute eosinophilic pneumonia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-diffuse-alveolar-hemorrhage-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The diffuse alveolar hemorrhage syndromes&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In some cases, it permits assessment of the stage of disease and potential responsiveness to therapy</p><p/><p>There are no absolute contraindications to the performance of BAL beyond those commonly associated with bronchoscopy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F79205\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79205 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-and-technique-of-bronchoalveolar-lavage/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. BAL is usually well tolerated; rarely, it is complicated by transient hypoxemia due to residual fluid in the alveoli. Thus, oxygen saturation should be assessed continuously, and all patients should breathe supplemental oxygen during the procedure, titrated to maintain the oxygen saturation above 92 percent. In patients with borderline oxygenation, elective preprocedure intubation and ventilation during the procedure should be considered, as oxygenation will likely deteriorate during the BAL. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flexible-bronchoscopy-in-adults-indications-and-contraindications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Flexible bronchoscopy in adults: Indications and contraindications&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNIQUE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) is performed following general inspection of the tracheobronchial tree and before biopsy or brushing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-and-technique-of-bronchoalveolar-lavage/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. This sequence minimizes the likelihood that iatrogenic bleeding will alter the concentration of cellular and protein components. The usual procedures for patient preparation, sedation, and monitoring for flexible bronchoscopy should be followed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flexible-bronchoscopy-in-adults-indications-and-contraindications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Flexible bronchoscopy in adults: Indications and contraindications&quot;</a>.)</p><p>BAL differs from bronchial washings, in which secretions are aspirated from large airways directly or following the instillation of 10 to 30 mL of saline.</p><p>Whole lung lavage is a different procedure that is uniquely used as therapy for pulmonary alveolar proteinosis; 30 to 50 liters of sterile saline are delivered via a double lumen endotracheal tube under general anesthesia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-pulmonary-alveolar-proteinosis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis of pulmonary alveolar proteinosis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Optimal site</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Little information exists regarding the optimal site in the lung for BAL, although a good general rule is to perform the lavage where the disease is most prominent radiographically [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-and-technique-of-bronchoalveolar-lavage/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In localized disease, lavage of the involved segment is more likely to yield the best results. In diffuse disease, the right middle lobe or lingula is lavaged most commonly because, when the patient is supine, the anatomy favors maximal recovery of fluid and cells from these sites. If anatomic or technical difficulties are encountered, either the superior or anterior segment of a lower lobe may be used.</p><p>Lavage in one site is usually adequate, especially if a cumulative volume of 100 mL or greater is instilled. A lavage volume of 100 mL samples approximately one million alveoli (1.5 to 3 percent of the lung). It is thought that such a sample provides a representative picture of the inflammatory and immune processes in the alveoli regardless of the site of the lavage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-and-technique-of-bronchoalveolar-lavage/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Nevertheless, some centers routinely instill 100 mL of fluid into each of two or three different areas. Such an approach may be particularly useful when there is marked radiographic heterogeneity in the disease process. The lavage site(s) should always be recorded in the bronchoscopy report.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Fluid instillation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the lavage site has been chosen, the bronchoscope is advanced into a subsegmental bronchus until the lumen is occluded; this is referred to as the &quot;wedged&quot; position. Care must be taken to avoid &quot;over wedging&quot; the bronchoscope, since this can result in additional trauma to the airway and diminish fluid recovery. A good wedge position is usually confirmed by noting slight airway collapse when gentle suction is applied. A poor wedge position allows leakage of lavage fluid around the bronchoscope, leading to cough soon after the fluid is instilled. Optimum fluid recovery occurs when the bronchoscope completely occludes the bronchial lumen of a third or fourth bronchial subsegment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-and-technique-of-bronchoalveolar-lavage/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Sterile buffered or unbuffered saline (commercial 0.9 percent NaCl without additives for intravenous use) is used as the instillate. Prewarming the lavage fluid to 37&ordm;C has been suggested to decrease coughing and to increase the cellular yield, but most groups continue to use room temperature saline.</p><p>The total volume of fluid to be instilled has not been standardized. BAL typically involves the delivery of a total of 100 to 240 mL of fluid in 20 to 60 mL aliquots; larger volumes are occasionally used for research purposes. We usually use two to three sequential aliquots of 40 to 60 mL each. Using tubing with an inline clamp or three way stopcock, a saline-filled, 50 to 60 mL syringe is attached to the side port of the bronchoscope. The first aliquot of saline is instilled slowly and steadily [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-and-technique-of-bronchoalveolar-lavage/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Fluid recovery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After the first aliquot of saline is infused, it is recovered immediately into the same syringe by gentle continuous hand suction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-and-technique-of-bronchoalveolar-lavage/abstract/2,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,11</a>]. Suction should be gentle enough that visible airway collapse does not occur. In patients with marked airway collapse despite gentle suction, the suctioning process should be slower, and discontinuous suction should be used to maximize fluid retrieval. When no further fluid can be aspirated, the clamp or stopcock is closed and the syringe (but not the tubing) is removed. The second saline filled syringe is attached to the tubing and the procedure is repeated. Following these steps, a third lavage is completed, if desired.</p><p>In patients with suspected alveolar hemorrhage, three sequential lavages are performed at the same site. The recovered samples are visually inspected for any increase in hemorrhagic appearance from the first syringe to the third. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-diffuse-alveolar-hemorrhage-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The diffuse alveolar hemorrhage syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There is no established <strong>dwell time</strong> for the fluid to remain before it is suctioned back. We feel that the cellular and noncellular yield is improved by having the patient take several breaths before the fluid is retrieved, though some have raised concern about breaking the wedged position by adding this step. The total duration of lavage after wedging the bronchoscope should take approximately 5 to 10 minutes.</p><p>Lavage fluid recovery is influenced by several factors:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It increases with larger volumes instilled. The first aliquot of fluid tends to be poorly recovered (&lt;20 percent); with subsequent aliquots, the return increases, such that 40 to 70 percent of the total instilled volume is recovered.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Small instilled volumes (less than 100 mL) increase the likelihood of contamination of lavage fluid by mucus and large airway cells, rather than sampling of distal (alveolar) sites.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A history of current or past smoking or the presence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) significantly decreases the fluid recovery rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-and-technique-of-bronchoalveolar-lavage/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The average BAL fluid recovery in normal healthy nonsmokers is between 50 to 80 percent of the instilled volume, compared with recovery as low as 20 to 30 percent in otherwise healthy smokers.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fluid recovery decreases with increasing age.</p><p/><p>The lavage procedure should be terminated if the instilled volume exceeds recovery by more than 100 mL, or if the patient experiences substantial distress (eg, excessive coughing) or falling oxygen saturation requiring increased oxygen supplementation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-and-technique-of-bronchoalveolar-lavage/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">PROCESSING THE LAVAGE SPECIMEN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The recovered lavage fluid should be pooled into a single container (siliconized glass or non-cell adherent plastic) and the total volume measured. Controversy exists about whether to include the first aliquot of fluid recovered with the remainder; this is more of an issue when the specimen is being processed for cell counts in patients with interstitial lung disease than when evaluating for infection. The first aliquot is usually a small volume and represents a disproportionate amount of bronchial airway material (epithelial cells and neutrophils) compared to alveolar fluid. Our practice is to pool all of the recovered bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and to ensure that the pooled fluid is well-mixed.</p><p>BAL fluid generally should be transported to the laboratory on ice, but can be stored or transported at room temperature if processing will occur in less than one hour. Cells in BAL fluid remain viable for up to four hours when stored at 25&ordm;C. In general, BAL samples should be processed immediately for culture; however, storage up to 24 hours at 4&deg;C does not result in loss of diagnostic accuracy of microbiologic culture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-and-technique-of-bronchoalveolar-lavage/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">CELL COUNTING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cell counting of BAL fluid is useful in the evaluation of certain interstitial lung diseases, such as the eosinophilic pneumonias, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, sarcoidosis, and drug-induced lung disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=role-of-bronchoalveolar-lavage-in-diagnosis-of-interstitial-lung-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Role of bronchoalveolar lavage in diagnosis of interstitial lung disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial processing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of steps are involved in the optimal processing and examination of BAL samples. The lavage fluid frequently contains large amounts of mucus. When cell counts will be performed in the evaluation of interstitial lung disease, filtration of the fluid through sterile cotton gauze or nylon mesh is often performed to prevent the mixing of mucus with the cell pellet after centrifugation; filtration also results in the preferential removal of bronchial epithelial cells. An aliquot of the fluid and cells should be stored in case future testing is required.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Total cell counts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The total number of leukocytes recovered by lavage is determined by examination of a sample of the pooled fluid with a hemocytometer. The cell counts are most accurate when done on the original, pooled sample before any washing procedure has been performed; washing results in a loss of total cells and a decrease in the cell viability.</p><p>The total white cell count is usually expressed both as the total number of cells recovered per lavage and as the concentration of cells per mL of recovered fluid. Red blood cells and epithelial cells should be enumerated, but are not included in the total white cell count.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential cell counts</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Differential cell counts are used to determine whether the patient has an eosinophil or lymphocyte predominant pattern of diffuse lung disease. Cell counts are most frequently determined on slides prepared either by cytocentrifugation or filtration. These procedures are operator-dependent and should be performed by an experienced and properly trained cytotechnologist.</p><p>With either technique, at least 8 to 10 slides are prepared. The differential counts are performed with a light microscope employing 25x and 40x objectives. Counts are made from random fields of 200 to 500 cells. Esterase staining is often employed to distinguish immature macrophages from large lymphocytes. The number of ciliated or squamous epithelial cells should be noted, but they are not included in the differential count.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cytocentrifugation</strong> &ndash; Cytocentrifugation is the more commonly used method for obtaining a differential cell count; as the name implies, it collects cells by virtue of their outward migration when centrifuged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-and-technique-of-bronchoalveolar-lavage/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Differential counting is commonly performed on air-dried (15 to 30 minutes) May-Grunwald-Giemsa or Wright-Giemsa stained preparations. The specimens have less distortion of cell structure and less cell loss (especially the selective loss of lymphocytes) when the &quot;neat&quot; fluid, ie, the original sample before centrifugation and resuspension, is used for the cytocentrifuge preparation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Advantages of this technique include lower cost than filtration methods and the fact that cytocentrifugation slides permit detection of more subtle cytologic features which can occasionally aid diagnosis. Special stains for iron, inorganic dust, malignant cells, and microorganisms may be performed if desired.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Filtration</strong> &ndash; With the filtration method, differential cell counts are performed after trapping cells on a filter. The cells are then stained with hematoxylin and eosin or the modified Papanicolaou technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-and-technique-of-bronchoalveolar-lavage/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. This method offers two advantages. First, cell retention by the filter is high, providing a more accurate representation of the cell types and numbers recovered by lavage. Second, these slides can be stored indefinitely without significant loss of cell detail or staining. The major disadvantages of the filter preparations are that they may underestimate the number of neutrophils, and that the method is considerably more time consuming and costly than cytocentrifuge preparation.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Adequacy of BAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No clear criteria exist for determining the adequacy of the BAL specimen. Unsatisfactory specimens for cell counts for evaluating interstitial lung disease:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contain fewer than two million total cells</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have fewer than 10 alveolar macrophages per high power field</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contain excessive numbers of epithelial cells, either showing morphologic degenerative changes or exceeding the number of alveolar macrophages present</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contain a mucopurulent exudate of polymorphonuclear cells</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contain excessive red blood cells due to trauma during the procedure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contain degenerative changes or laboratory artifacts obscuring cell identity.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Data expression</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common method is to present cell differential data in the same manner used for peripheral blood, ie, each white cell type is given as a percentage of the total white cells recovered. The advantage of this method is that it provides the data in a fashion that is familiar. A disadvantage is that the numbers presented are proportions of the total and, as such, changes in the absolute numbers of a single cell line necessarily affect the reported percentages of all cell lines.</p><p>With the total cell method, the differential is combined with the total cell count to quantify the absolute numbers of each cell type per volume of fluid recovered. The advantage of this method is that it also gives insight into the total number of effector cells present in the alveolar structures. Unfortunately, such quantification is most meaningful if standardized lavage volumes are instilled and recovered. At present, such standardization is not possible, and the differential percentage count of total BAL cells is the more commonly used approach. However, until clear standards are established, both methods should be used and reported by the cytology laboratory.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Noncellular components of BAL</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The usefulness of routine measurement of the noncellular components of BAL in clinical practice remains to be elucidated. It has been extremely difficult to determine what proportion of the fluid recovered by lavage represents alveolar fluid from the distal airways and alveoli, so-called epithelial lining fluid (ELF). Several approaches have been proposed to determine the volume of epithelial lining fluid recovered by BAL, including quantitation of albumin, total lavage protein, potassium, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylene-blue-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylene blue</a>, and urea. However, none of these have become standard practice. In the future, proteomic analysis of ELF may become an attractive method to examine for changes in protein expression and secretion during the course of pulmonary disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-and-technique-of-bronchoalveolar-lavage/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Lymphocyte subpopulations and immunohistochemistry</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Application of immunofluorescent and immunocytochemical techniques to the analysis of cells recovered from BAL is helpful in the diagnosis of certain interstitial lung diseases and pulmonary lymphomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-and-technique-of-bronchoalveolar-lavage/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>].

After incubation with these antibodies, the cells are passed through a flow cytometer for counting and assessment of polyclonality. The CD4 to CD8 ratio can then be calculated. The advantage of flow cytometry over hand counting of immunohistochemical stained cells on cytocentrifuge prepared slides is the greater number of cells counted by flow cytometry. </p><p>Flow cytometry can also be used to identify monoclonal populations of lymphocytes that indicate lymphomatous or leukemic infiltrates.</p><p>When pulmonary Langerhans cell histiocytosis (PLCH) is suspected (middle and upper lung zone predominant nodular and cystic lesions), staining for CD-1a, S-100 protein, or CD207 (langerin) can be diagnostic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/basic-principles-and-technique-of-bronchoalveolar-lavage/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>].

Papanicolaou staining is typically used for detecting tumor cells and viral inclusion bodies; periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining to identify PAS-positive lipoproteinaceous material in the distal air spaces and macrophages; and Prussian blue staining for hemosiderin to detect macrophages that have taken up red cells during chronic bleeding, as in diffuse alveolar hemorrhage.

The BeLPT requires more cells than are usually obtained during BAL, so four successive 60 mL lavages (total instilled volume of 240 mL) are performed.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>BAL is an excellent technique for evaluating opportunistic infections in immunocompromised hosts. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Patient selection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are no absolute contraindications to the performance of BAL beyond those commonly associated with bronchoscopy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F79205\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79205 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Patient selection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In localized disease, lavage of the involved segment is most likely to yield the best results. In diffuse disease, the right middle lobe or lingula is often chosen to optimize fluid recovery. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Technique'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The total volume of fluid to be instilled during BAL has not been standardized. We usually use two to three sequential aliquots of 40 to 60 mL each. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Fluid instillation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A number of steps are involved in the optimal processing and examination of BAL samples for total and differential cell counting. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Cell counting'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lymphocyte subpopulations (eg, CD3, CD4, CD8) can be assessed using immunofluorescent labeled monoclonal antibodies and either flow cytometry or hand counting of a slide from a cytocentrifuge specimen. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Lymphocyte subpopulations and immunohistochemistry'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depending on the clinical situation, samples of BAL fluid may be sent for a variety of microbiologic analyses, including bacterial, viral and fungal cultures, and also direct fluorescent antigen (DFA) staining for Legionella or Pneumocystis jirovecii. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Microbiologic analysis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cytology of BAL fluid may be of use in the evaluation of some diffuse neoplasms affecting the lung (eg, bronchoalveolar carcinoma, lymphangitic carcinomatosis, and lymphoma) and in the evaluation of some diffuse lung diseases (eg, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis).
