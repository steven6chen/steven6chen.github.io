OSA is the most common type of sleep-disordered breathing, with an estimated prevalence of 1 in 4 males and 1 in 10 females for mild OSA, and 1 in 9 males and 1 in 20 females for moderate OSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-risk-and-the-preoperative-evaluation-and-management-of-adults-with-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. OSA has been increasing in prevalence over the last two decades in parallel with the increase in obesity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-risk-and-the-preoperative-evaluation-and-management-of-adults-with-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. Over half of patients with OSA who present for surgery are undiagnosed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-risk-and-the-preoperative-evaluation-and-management-of-adults-with-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>The incidence of perioperative complications is greater in patients with OSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-risk-and-the-preoperative-evaluation-and-management-of-adults-with-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/8-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-13</a>], leading the American Society of Anesthesiologists, the American Academy of Sleep Medicine, and others to develop clinical practice guidelines and protocols for the perioperative management of patients with OSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-risk-and-the-preoperative-evaluation-and-management-of-adults-with-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/3,14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,14-16</a>]. Recommendations include maintaining a high index of suspicion for OSA, careful use of medications, vigilant monitoring for upper airway obstruction, and an integrated team approach to perioperative management. There is little direct evidence that these precautions improve outcomes, so recommendations are generally based upon indirect evidence, clinical rationale, and expert opinion.</p><p>The preoperative evaluation and management of patients with known or suspected OSA are reviewed here.

A 2012 meta-analysis examining the association between OSA and postoperative outcomes showed that OSA increased the odds of various postoperative complications by a factor of approximately two to four [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-risk-and-the-preoperative-evaluation-and-management-of-adults-with-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

OSA-related comorbidities (eg, obesity, systemic hypertension, pulmonary hypertension, cardiac arrhythmias, coronary artery disease, and heart failure) may also contribute to the increased perioperative complication rate.

One potential explanation is that sleep deprivation may lead to an increase in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, which is the stage of sleep when OSA is typically most severe. Sleep architecture disturbance is greatest during the first postoperative night in patients with and without OSA, and breathing disturbance (ie, apnea-hypopnea index) is greatest on the third postoperative night [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-risk-and-the-preoperative-evaluation-and-management-of-adults-with-obstructive-sleep-apnea/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

Respiratory complications are the most common. While unproven, it is likely that patients with more severe OSA are at greater risk. High-risk surgical procedures are those that are invasive, involve the airways or cardiovascular system, or are associated with need for high levels of postoperative opioids. (See <a href=\"#H15227501\" class=\"local\">'Perioperative risks'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation of patients with OSA should include results of recent sleep studies, details of treatment for OSA, current signs and symptoms of OSA, and the presence of OSA-associated medical conditions (obesity, airway abnormalities, cardiovascular disease). (See <a href=\"#H2282940\" class=\"local\">'Patients with known OSA'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Given the increasing prevalence of OSA, the ease of screening, and increased perioperative risks of OSA, we screen all preoperative patients for OSA.

Several screening tools have been validated in preoperative patients.
