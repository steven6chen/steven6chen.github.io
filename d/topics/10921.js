Most tumors (between 50 and 75 percent) are nonfunctioning and unassociated with a hormonal syndrome. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-epidemiology-clinical-presentation-localization-and-staging-of-pancreatic-neuroendocrine-neoplasms#H24623092\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification, epidemiology, clinical presentation, localization, and staging of pancreatic neuroendocrine neoplasms&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a>.)</p><p>For those who have potentially resectable metastatic disease, resection may provide prolonged control of symptoms and tumor growth. However, the majority of patients recur, even if resection is complete. For patients with unresectable disease, options to control tumor growth and symptoms related to tumor bulk or hormonal hypersecretion include somatostatin analogs, nonsurgical liver-directed therapy, and systemic antitumor therapy.</p><p>Patients with symptoms of hormone hypersecretion from a well-differentiated pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor (NET) should be managed with somatostatin analogs and other agents as appropriate to the specific syndrome. In general, initial therapy for insulinomas consists of carbohydrates and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diazoxide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diazoxide</a>, which directly inhibits the release of insulin from insulinoma cells. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=everolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Everolimus</a> can also be highly effective in improving glycemic control in patients with insulinoma. For patients with gastrinoma, high doses of oral proton pump inhibitors are the treatment of choice. Somatostatin analogs may be helpful for refractory cases. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Insulinoma&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-and-prognosis-of-the-zollinger-ellison-syndrome-gastrinoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management and prognosis of the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome (gastrinoma)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Somatostatin analogs and the molecularly targeted agents <a href=\"topic.htm?path=everolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">everolimus</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sunitinib-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sunitinib</a> also improve progression-free survival duration relative to supportive care alone in patients with metastases from a non-functioning pancreatic NET. For patients with low volume disease who are asymptomatic, we suggest waiting until disease progression or development of symptoms related to tumor bulk before beginning systemic therapy. For most patients with metastatic pancreatic NET who are felt to require therapy, somatostatin analogs may be preferred over a molecularly targeted agent as initial therapy because of the more favorable side effect profile. For patients who are highly symptomatic from tumor bulk or who have rapidly enlarging metastases, we suggest chemotherapy rather than molecularly targeted therapy or a somatostatin analog.

The ability of octreotide and lanreotide to inhibit the secretion of peptides from NET cells is mediated mainly through somatostatin receptor (SSTR)-2 and SSTR-5.</p><p>The presence of somatostatin receptors can be determined by diagnostic imaging using a radiolabeled somatostatin analog (indium-111 [111-In] pentetreotide [OctreoScan] or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gallium-ga-68-dotatate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Gallium Ga-68 DOTATATE</a> [68-Ga DOTATATE]). While either traditional imaging with 111-In-pentetreotide or 68-Ga DOTATATE can be used to assess somatostatin receptor status in patients with NET, the higher sensitivity of 68-Ga DOTATATE suggests that this may the preferred option in certain clinical scenarios, particularly in patients with smaller tumor volume. In general, uptake of radiotracer by the tumor is predictive of a response to therapy with somatostatin analogs. However, in some cases (ie, miliary disease), diagnostic imaging may be negative even if somatostatin receptors are present on the tumor. In such cases, a trial of somatostatin analog therapy can be considered even in the presence of a negative scan.

Although gastrointestinal and pancreatic NET are morphologically similar on routine histologic evaluation, they differ in terms of pathogenesis, biology, and response to therapy. Systemic treatment options for advanced gastrointestinal NET are discussed in detail elsewhere.

In general, initial therapy for insulinomas consists of dietary modifications.

Given a favorable toxicity profile, we suggest a somatostatin analog as an appropriate first choice for many patients with use of a targeted agent if there is subsequent disease progression. Everolimus may be of particular value in patients with functioning insulinomas and refractory hypoglycemia because of its association with hyperglycemia.
