It is located somewhere else in the body. An ectopic pregnancy is a serious condition and can even be life-threatening.</p><p>Pregnancy begins when a woman's egg joins together with a man's sperm. These cells grow into a bigger group of cells, called an &quot;embryo.&quot; In a normal pregnancy, the embryo attaches to the lining of the uterus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F80271\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80271 \">figure 1</a>). Then, it can grow into a baby (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F73238\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73238 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>In an ectopic pregnancy, a woman's egg joins with a man's sperm and forms an embryo. But the embryo does not attach to the lining of the uterus. Instead, it attaches to a place in the body that it should not attach to and starts to grow. Even though the embryo gets bigger, it cannot grow into a baby. As the embryo gets bigger, it can cause pain and bleeding and lead to other problems. Some of these problems can be life-threatening.</p><p>In most ectopic pregnancies, the embryo attaches to the lining of one of the fallopian tubes (the tubes that connect the ovaries to the uterus). When this happens, doctors also call it a &quot;tubal pregnancy.&quot; In rare cases, the embryo can also attach to the cervix, ovary, or the inside of the belly.</p><p>Some women have a higher chance than other women of having an ectopic pregnancy. A woman can have a higher chance of having an ectopic pregnancy if she:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Has abnormal or damaged fallopian tubes, such as from past infections or surgeries</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Had an ectopic pregnancy before</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Is getting certain treatments to help her get pregnant</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Smokes cigarettes</p><p/><p>Women who use a type of birth control called an &quot;intrauterine device&quot; or &quot;IUD&quot; have a very low chance of getting pregnant at all. But, if a woman using an IUD does get pregnant, she is at high risk of ectopic pregnancy and should have her doctor to check for ectopic pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6148522\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women who have an ectopic pregnancy don't always have symptoms early on. If a woman does have symptoms early on, she can have:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lower belly pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding from the vagina (the bleeding can be heavy or light, or it can even be just spots of blood or brown staining)</p><p/><p>Some women don't have any symptoms until the ectopic pregnancy causes more serious problems. For example, an embryo growing in a fallopian tube can cause the fallopian tube to burst open. When this happens, symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe lower belly pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heavy bleeding from the vagina</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fainting or passing out, or feeling like you might faint or pass out</p><p/><p>If you are pregnant and have any of the symptoms listed above, go to an emergency room as soon as possible.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6148529\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for an ectopic pregnancy?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To check if you have an ectopic pregnancy, your doctor or nurse can do:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A blood test to measure a hormone called hCG &ndash; This test checks if you are pregnant and how much hCG the pregnancy is making.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An imaging test called an ultrasound to see where the embryo is in your body &ndash; Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p/><p>Sometimes, test results show an ectopic pregnancy right away. But most of the time, doctors need to repeat the tests every few days to know for sure if a woman has an ectopic pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6148536\"><span class=\"h1\">How is an ectopic pregnancy treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors can treat an ectopic pregnancy in 2 ways, depending on the size of the embryo, the woman's symptoms, and other factors. Both treatments involve removing the embryo. A woman can be treated with:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicine &ndash; Your doctor can give you a shot of medicine. The medicine stops the embryo's growth and causes it to dissolve. Women who are treated with medicine need follow-up blood tests for a few weeks to make sure that the treatment worked.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery &ndash; A doctor can do surgery to remove the embryo. Your doctor might or might not need to remove your fallopian tube.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6148543\"><span class=\"h1\">Can an ectopic pregnancy be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most ectopic pregnancies cannot be prevented. But women have a higher chance of having an ectopic pregnancy if they get a lot of infections that you catch during sex. To reduce your chance of getting a disease from sex, you can use a condom.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6148550\"><span class=\"h1\">Can I get pregnant in the future?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most women are able to have a normal pregnancy after having an ectopic pregnancy. But let your doctor or nurse know if you are trying to get pregnant. That way, he or she can follow your pregnancy to make sure everything is normal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6148557\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=infertility-in-women-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Infertility in women (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlamydia-and-gonorrhea-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chlamydia and gonorrhea (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=choosing-birth-control-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Choosing birth control (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ectopic-tubal-pregnancy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Ectopic (tubal) pregnancy (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=gonorrhea-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Gonorrhea (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlamydia-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Chlamydia (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=in-vitro-fertilization-ivf-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: In vitro fertilization (IVF) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
