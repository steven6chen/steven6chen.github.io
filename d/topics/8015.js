When this happens, the part of the heart that normally gets blood from that artery is damaged. The longer the time the artery is blocked, the bigger the heart attack. The arteries that supply blood to the heart are called the &quot;coronary arteries.&quot;</p><p>Heart attacks are usually the result of a condition called &quot;coronary heart disease&quot; or &quot;coronary artery disease.&quot; In this disease, fatty deposits called plaques form on the walls of the coronary arteries (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F61785\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61785 \">figure 1</a>). These plaques sometimes break open and cause blood clots to form. Then the blood clot can block off the artery and keep blood from reaching parts of the heart muscle. That is what causes most heart attacks (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F60394\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60394 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13395734\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a heart attack?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People having a heart attack often notice (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F52579\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52579 \">figure 3</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain, pressure, or discomfort in the chest</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain, tingling, or discomfort in other parts of the upper body, including the arms, back, neck, jaw, or stomach</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shortness of breath</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea, vomiting, burping, or heartburn</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sweating or cold, clammy skin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A racing or uneven heartbeat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling dizzy or lightheaded</p><p/><p>If you think you might be having a heart attack, <strong>call 9-1-1 right away</strong>. Do not try to get to the hospital on your own.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13395741\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for heart attacks?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If your doctor thinks you are having a heart attack, he or she might order one or more of these tests:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>An electrocardiogram (ECG or EKG)</strong> &ndash; This test measures the electrical activity in your heart.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Blood tests</strong> &ndash; During a heart attack, the heart releases certain chemicals. If these chemicals are in your blood, it might mean you are having a heart attack.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Echocardiogram</strong> &ndash; This test uses sound waves to create an image of your heart as it beats. In a heart attack, not all parts or the heart pump normally.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cardiac catheterization (also called &quot;cardiac cath&quot;)</strong> &ndash; During this test, the doctor puts a thin tube into a blood vessel in your leg or arm. Then he or she moves the tube up to your heart. Next, the doctor puts a dye that shows up on X-ray into the tube. This part of the test is called &quot;coronary angiography.&quot; It can show whether any of the arteries in your heart are clogged.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13395748\"><span class=\"h1\">How is a heart attack treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you go to the hospital while you are having a heart attack, the doctors and nurses will do a few things:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They might give you oxygen through a mask or a tube in your nose.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They will give you pain medicines to ease the chest pain and discomfort of a heart attack. They might also give you something to help you relax.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They will give you medicines to help keep more blood clots from forming.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They might give you a medicine called a beta blocker to reduce your heart's need for oxygen. This medicine can help reduce the damage caused by a heart attack.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>They will try to get blood flowing again through the clogged artery. Doctors can do this in 1 of 2 ways:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>They can give you medicines through a thin tube that goes into a vein, called an &quot;IV,&quot; to break up clots. These have been called &quot;clot busters.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>They can do a procedure called &quot;stenting&quot; combination with cardiac catheterization. This involves putting a tiny metal tube called a &quot;stent&quot; into the blocked artery to hold it open.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you cannot get a stent, or if the stent does not work, your doctor might suggest open heart surgery. This is also called &quot;coronary artery bypass grafting&quot; or &quot;bypass surgery&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F73589\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73589 \">figure 4</a>). During this surgery, doctors create a new path &ndash; a detour &ndash; for blood to get around the clogged portion of the artery. They do this using a combination of your own arteries and veins.</p><p/><p>You will likely stay in the hospital for 3 to 5 days, unless your heart attack led to other problems that need treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13395755\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens after a heart attack?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After you've had a heart attack, you will probably need to:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Take more medicines than before.</strong> It is very important that you take all your medicines every day, as directed. The medicines given to people who have had a heart attack can help prevent other heart attacks, and they reduce the chances of having a stroke or dying. If you can't afford your medicines, or if the medicines give you side effects, mention it to your doctor. There are often ways to solve these problems.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Improve the way you eat.</strong> Try to avoid fried foods and too many foods with sugar. Eat lots of fruits and vegetables. Try to eat foods that have fiber in them.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lose weight, if you are overweight.</strong> Losing extra weight reduces the chance of another heart attack and can make you feel better.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Become more active.</strong> Walking, gardening, or any activity that gets you to move more can help reduce the risk.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13395881\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medicines-after-a-heart-attack-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medicines after a heart attack (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-attack-recovery-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Heart attack recovery (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=coronary-heart-disease-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Coronary heart disease (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chest-pain-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Chest pain (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-blood-pressure-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: High blood pressure in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-cholesterol-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: High cholesterol (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=what-can-go-wrong-after-a-heart-attack-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: What can go wrong after a heart attack?
