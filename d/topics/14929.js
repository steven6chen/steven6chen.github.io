It has been speculated that accumulated damage to the RBC, especially to its membrane, renders the aging RBC unfit to circulate, leading to its destruction, via mechanisms that are poorly understood.</p><p>The normal time of RBC senescent (age-related) death in adults is approximately 110 to 120 days. Hemolysis can therefore be arbitrarily defined as a shortening in the survival of circulating RBCs to a value of less than 100 days.</p><p>This topic will review the mechanisms of normal RBC destruction and the methods used to measure RBC survival, which may be used in the evaluation of patients with suspected hemolysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-survival-normal-values-and-measurement/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Approaches to the patient with hemolytic anemia and with anemia in general are presented separately.

These two processes may not be fully independent of one another [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-survival-normal-values-and-measurement/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Senescence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Virtually all RBCs in normal subjects die of processes associated with &quot;wear and tear&quot; associated with prolonged circulation within the intravascular space.

Such antibodies, when membrane bound, lead to partial complement activation on the red cell surface, which may be associated with decreased red cell deformability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-survival-normal-values-and-measurement/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].

These unique vascular channels end blindly, unlike others in the body. The only way for an RBC, which has a diameter of 7 to 8 microns, to escape from these cords and return to the general circulation is to deform sufficiently to pass through 2 to 4 micron slits in the walls of the cords (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F53105\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53105 \">picture 1</a>). Cells that negotiate this process survive; those that cannot find themselves in a hostile environment, surrounded by cells of the monocyte-macrophage system. It is at this stage that senescent signals on the RBC membrane are detected by phagocytic cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-survival-normal-values-and-measurement/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Aging cells that fail this quality control step lose part or all of their membrane, with approximately two to three million RBCs being destroyed per second through these processes.</p><p>Senescent death of RBCs can be approximated mathematically by a Gaussian distribution (the &quot;bell shaped&quot; curve), with a mean time of senescent death (mean potential RBC lifespan) in normal adults of approximately 110 to 120 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-survival-normal-values-and-measurement/abstract/5,11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,11-13</a>]. Senescence signals most likely arise from alterations in membrane proteins on the surface of aging RBC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-survival-normal-values-and-measurement/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Candidate processes include exposure of cryptic alpha-galactosyl residues or phosphatidylserine on the RBC surface, alterations in the anion transporter (band 3) protein, altered expression or recognition of CD45 or CD47 on the red cell surface, increased membrane immunoglobulin, and accumulated membrane damage and stiffness from the effects of reactive oxygen species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-survival-normal-values-and-measurement/abstract/15-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Random RBC death</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rate of random or age-independent RBC destruction is quite low in normal subjects, in the range of less than 0.05 to 0.5 percent per day; this value can be appreciably increased in hemolytic states, especially when destruction in an enlarged spleen is part of the hemolytic process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-survival-normal-values-and-measurement/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. It has been estimated that, in healthy individuals, up to 20 percent of the RBC's content of hemoglobin is lost during its lifespan secondary to loss of membrane-bound hemoglobin by the process of vesiculation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-survival-normal-values-and-measurement/abstract/4,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,24</a>].</p><p>When the rate of random hemolysis is sufficiently high, RBCs may die solely from this process, since few survive long enough to die of age-related changes. As an example, when the rate of random hemolysis is 0.5 percent per day, the chance that a red cell will survive to an age of 100 days is 61 percent. On the other hand, the chance of survival to 100 days falls below 1 percent when the rate of random hemolysis is &ge;5 percent per day.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">DETERMINATION OF RBC LIFESPAN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Three general methods are available for accurate determination of the RBC lifespan: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Random labeling of RBCs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cohort labeling of RBCs</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Kinetic studies of iron, bilirubin (and other bile pigments), or carbon monoxide metabolism</p><p/><p>An historical review of RBC survival methodologies is available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-survival-normal-values-and-measurement/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], beginning with the Ashby differential RBC agglutination studies initially published in 1919 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-survival-normal-values-and-measurement/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3563332\"><span class=\"h2\">Utility of RBC survival studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>With few exceptions, all of the above methods for determination of RBC survival entail the use of radioactive or nonradioactive isotopes, are time-consuming, expensive, and require the patient to be in a steady state throughout the study. However, such studies were instrumental in our gaining an accurate understanding of RBC production and destruction in normal subjects as well as in various disorders of hematopoiesis, such as aplastic anemia, pernicious anemia, thalassemia, and the various hemolytic anemias.</p><p>RBC survival studies are rarely employed in the 21<sup>st</sup> century for studies in individual patients, as routine laboratory studies for detecting intravascular and extravascular hemolysis are routinely available (eg, LDH, indirect bilirubin, haptoglobin, urine for cell-free hemoglobin and hemosiderin). A candidate for such studies might be the rare patient with anemia in whom the underlying mechanism is unclear. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-hemolytic-anemia-in-the-adult\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of hemolytic anemia in the adult&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, research applications of RBC survival methods continue to be important for the evaluation of RBC storage media, the effects of agents employed to improve RBC survival in the hemolytic anemias, and understanding the relationship between RBC survival and hemoglobin A1c levels in diabetic subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-survival-normal-values-and-measurement/abstract/3,26-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,26-29</a>].

This is based upon the fact that, in order to maintain a constant RBC mass, the bone marrow must produce as many new RBCs (reticulocytes) per day as are being destroyed. Thus, for a mean RBC survival of 120 days, 0.83 percent of the RBC mass is destroyed and replaced each day. This is the RBC turnover rate, the reciprocal of RBC survival:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">RBC turnover rate <span class=\"nowrap\">(percent/day)</span> &#160; = &#160; 100 &#160;&divide; &#160;RBC survival (days)</p></div></div><p/><p>The actual lifespan of the reticulocyte is approximately four days, the first three of which are spent in the marrow in normal subjects, with only the final day being spent in the circulation. Thus, if the patient is not anemic, reticulocytes should represent approximately 0.8 percent of circulating RBCs. This is in line with the generally accepted normal range of 0.5 to 1.5 percent. </p><p>It is therefore possible, under steady state conditions in which the secretion and response to erythropoietin are intact, to estimate RBC survival from knowledge of the reticulocyte percentage, the hematocrit, and the reticulocyte's lifespan within the circulation (RLS):</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">RBC survival (days) &#160;&asymp; &#160;100 &#160;&divide; &#160;[Reticulocytes (percent) &#160;&divide; &#160;RLS (days)]</p></div></div><p/><p>For this calculation, the RLS equals 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 days at hematocrits of 45, 35, 25, and 15 percent, respectively (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F61552\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61552 \">figure 1</a>). The reason for this prolongation in RLS in the circulation with increasing degrees of anemia is that, as anemia becomes more severe, and with increasing bone marrow stimulation by erythropoietin, reticulocytes leave the bone marrow at an earlier stage in their maturation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-with-anemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult with anemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The clinical utility of this approach can be appreciated by the following example of an adult with sickle cell anemia, a hematocrit of 27 percent, and a reticulocyte count of 15 percent.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using the above calculations, the estimated RBC survival is 13 days (100 &divide; [15 &divide; 2]) and the rate of RBC turnover is 7.5 percent per day (100 &divide; 13).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>This turnover rate (7.5 percent per day) exceeds the adult marrow's maximum sustainable capacity (5 percent per day compared with 1 percent per day in normals). Thus, this patient's marrow can only deliver 67 percent (5 &divide; 7.5) of the needed RBCs, resulting in a HCT of 27 percent (67 percent of the normal value of 40 percent). If this patient's bone marrow is suppressed, such as during an intercurrent infection, an even lower HCT will rapidly ensue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-survival-normal-values-and-measurement/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>If this subject's RBC production were to become 100 percent suppressed, as may occur following an intercurrent parvovirus B19 infection, the rate of fall of the patient's HCT will be 7.5 percent per day, since no new RBCs would be entering into the circulation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-parvovirus-b19-infection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of parvovirus B19 infection&quot;</a>.) After seven days, during which time the patient's reticulocytes will have vanished from the circulation, the HCT will have fallen to approximately 15 percent, with obvious severe clinical consequences.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The outcome is different when transient erythroid aplasia occurs in a hematologically normal subject (RBC survival of 120 days, reticulocyte count of 1 percent, HCT of 45 percent). In such a patient, the RBC turnover rate is 0.8 percent per day (100 &divide; 120). After seven days of erythroid aplasia, the HCT would have fallen to 94 percent of its initial value, to a level of 42 percent, which is still in the normal range and would not be noticeable. An example of this in a patient with extended erythroid aplasia due to idiopathic pure red cell aplasia is shown in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F98749\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef98749 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Random label RBC survival methods</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=biotin-vitamin-h-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Biotin</a><strong><span class=\"nowrap\">/avidin</span> method</strong> &ndash; This method is used in clinical research studies when it becomes important to determine the lifespan of the entire population (or selected subpopulations) of RBCs. It is not used clinically. An aliquot of RBCs is labeled in vitro with biotin, washed to remove unreacted reagent, reinfused into the subject, and activity periodically monitored by reacting a sample of blood with fluorescein-labeled avidin or streptavidin, followed by flow cytometric quantitation of fluorescein-labeled RBC as a percentage of the total [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-survival-normal-values-and-measurement/abstract/3,31-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,31-35</a>].

Blood samples are removed periodically, and survival is measured from the resulting plot of RBC radioactivity versus time after injection. While these techniques can also be used to determine blood volume, two major parameters of RBC survival can be obtained: the RBC half-time and the time of RBC senescence. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-approach-to-the-patient-with-polycythemia#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic approach to the patient with polycythemia&quot;, section on 'Blood volume measurement'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Differential agglutination</strong> &ndash; The Ashby differential agglutination method, which is also mainly of historic interest, is based upon administration of type O blood into a subject with type A or B blood and serially measuring the number of non-agglutinated RBC as a function of time following injection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-survival-normal-values-and-measurement/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].

However, the most commonly used radioactive isotope in the past for this purpose (<sup>51</sup>Cr) was not a perfect label, and eluted from the RBC at a rate of approximately 1 percent per day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-survival-normal-values-and-measurement/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Thus, when employing <sup>51</sup>Cr, the observed half-time was shorter than the theoretical value, in the range of 28 to 37 days for healthy adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-survival-normal-values-and-measurement/abstract/31,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,36</a>], with values as low as 5 to 10 days in individuals with sickle cell anemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-survival-normal-values-and-measurement/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>].</p><p>While corrections can be made to adjust for label elution, the <sup>51</sup>Cr half-time was used directly as a semiquantitative measure of RBC lifespan.

The time when the last labeled RBC has left the circulation is called the &quot;extinction time,&quot; and represents the time of death, by senescence, of labeled reticulocytes present in the original sample. This value is equal to the mean potential lifespan of the subject's RBC, averaging 120 days (range: 100 to 132 days) in normal healthy adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-survival-normal-values-and-measurement/abstract/31,34,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,34,36</a>].</p><p>Similar reasoning applies to the determination of the lifespan of fetal red cells transfused into the maternal circulation via an unplanned, large volume fetomaternal hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/red-blood-cell-survival-normal-values-and-measurement/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].
