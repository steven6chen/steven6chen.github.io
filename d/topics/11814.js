A subset of these patients have symptoms related to continued reflux of non-acidic material. This topic review will review the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of non-acid reflux. A general approach to patients with suspected GERD who have persistent symptoms despite PPI therapy is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-refractory-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to refractory gastroesophageal reflux disease in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TERMINOLOGY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acid reflux is defined as the reflux of gastric contents with a pH &lt;4.0</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Non-acid reflux is defined as reflux of gastric contents with a pH &gt;4.0 (ie, above the threshold used by conventional pH monitoring to identify acid reflux)</p><p/><p>Some experts define gastroesophageal reflux (GER) episodes with a pH of 4.0 to 7.0 as weakly acidic reflux, and GER with a pH above 7.0 weakly alkaline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-acid-reflux-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. However, given the low prevalence of weakly alkaline reflux episodes, we separate GER episodes into acid and non-acid using a cutoff value of 4.0, thereby grouping weakly acidic and weakly alkaline reflux into &quot;non-acid&quot; reflux.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are limited data on the prevalence of non-acid reflux episodes in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) whose symptoms are controlled with proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) (ie, the prevalence of asymptomatic non-acid reflux).</p><p>It is estimated that approximately 40 percent of GERD patients have persistent symptoms despite PPIs, and with objective testing, up to 40 percent of these patients have symptomatic non-acid reflux (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F57581\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57581 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-acid-reflux-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/2-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6</a>]. In a multicenter study that included 168 GERD patients with persistent symptoms on a PPI twice daily who underwent combined multichannel intraluminal impedance and pH (MII-pH) monitoring. Among 144 patients who recorded symptoms during the study period, 53 (37 percent) had a positive symptoms index with non-acid reflux, while only 16 (11 percent) had a positive symptom index for continued acid reflux [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-acid-reflux-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

In patients on proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), treatment changes the acidity of the refluxate but does not decrease the volume of reflux or affect structural and motility abnormalities at the gastroesophageal junction responsible for GERD (ie, hiatal hernias, decreased lower esophageal sphincter pressure, transient lower esophageal relaxations). In patients not taking acid suppressive medications (ie, off PPI therapy), non-acid reflux results when gastric acid is buffered by the ingested food in the postprandial period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-acid-reflux-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. </p><p>The exact mechanism by which non-acid reflux episodes produce symptoms remains uncertain. It is hypothesized that abrupt distension of the lower esophagus stimulates mechanoreceptors in the esophagus. In addition, the composition (mixed liquid-gas) and proximal extent of refluxate (episodes reaching the proximal esophagus) are important determinants of whether reflux episodes are symptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-acid-reflux-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1906793\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of non-acid reflux episodes do not cause symptoms. Patients with symptomatic non-acid reflux usually present with heartburn (pyrosis) and regurgitation despite acid suppressive therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-acid-reflux-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Whether extra-esophageal symptoms can truly be attributed to non-acid reflux is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-acid-reflux-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. In one study in which 50 patients with chronic cough underwent combined MII-pH monitoring while on acid suppressive therapy, there was an association between cough and non-acid reflux in only 13 patients (26 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-acid-reflux-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4294000712\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical suspicion and diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Non-acid reflux should be suspected in patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) that is refractory to maximal acid suppression therapy (eg, twice daily proton pump inhibitor [PPI]). Patients with suspected non-acid reflux require an upper endoscopy with biopsies to exclude alternative diagnoses (eg, eosinophilic esophagitis). We perform combined multichannel intraluminal impedance and pH (MII-pH) testing to establish the diagnosis of non-acid reflux. A refluxate with pH &gt;4 in a patient in whom at least one-half of the symptoms are associated with reflux is diagnostic of non-acid reflux. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-refractory-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-adults#H3417117953\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to refractory gastroesophageal reflux disease in adults&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic testing'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5204359\"><span class=\"h2\">Impedance pH testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MII-pH has a high sensitivity for detecting reflux episodes. In patients with refractory GERD symptoms in whom non-acid reflux is suspected, we perform testing on acid-suppressive therapy (ie, a PPI twice daily before meals) for at least one week before combined MII-pH testing. MII-pH testing while on PPI therapy can clarify the effectiveness of acid suppression by evaluating distal esophageal acid exposure and evaluate whether episodes of non-acid reflux are associated with symptoms. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=esophageal-multichannel-intraluminal-impedance-testing\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Esophageal multichannel intraluminal impedance testing&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Impedance pH testing uses inherent conductive or resistive properties of the intraluminal bolus (liquid, gas, or mixed) to examine the presence and transit of the bolus in the esophageal lumen. Impedance-detected reflux episodes associated with a decline in pH from above to below 4.0 are considered acid, whereas impedance-detected reflux episodes during which the pH remains above 4.0 are considered to be non-acid (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F80772\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef80772 \">figure 3</a>). In addition, combined MII-pH monitoring also provides information on the number of acid and non-acid reflux episodes, and their relationship with symptoms. A detailed description of MII-pH is presented separately.

Non-acid reflux can be distinguished from these conditions by impedance pH testing. Patients with reflux hypersensitivity have normal acid exposure but a positive symptom association with acid or weakly acid reflux. Patients with functional heartburn have normal acid exposure and a negative symptom reflux association.

Lifestyle interventions that have been demonstrated to improve esophageal pH <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> symptoms in patients with GERD include weight loss for patients who are overweight or have had recent weight gain, elevation of the head of the bed, refraining from assuming a supine position after meals, and avoidance of meals two to three hours before bedtime [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-acid-reflux-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

We initiate therapy with a low dose of baclofen (5 to 10 mg twice a day before meals). In patients who fail to respond, we make incremental changes and increase the dose by 5 mg every four days to 20 mg three times a day while carefully monitoring for side effects. Because baclofen crosses the blood-brain barrier, a variety of central nervous system-related side effects may occur. These include somnolence, confusion, dizziness, lightheadedness, drowsiness, weakness, and trembling. We usually continue baclofen for four to eight weeks before stopping, if it is ineffective. </p><p>Data to support the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=baclofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">baclofen</a> in patients with non-acid reflux are limited. Baclofen reduces the rate of transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxations, and in physiologic studies, has been associated with a reduction in both acid and non-acid postprandial reflux [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-acid-reflux-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/15-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15-17</a>]. In a meta-analysis of nine randomized trials that included 283 patients with GERD and healthy volunteers who were assigned to baclofen or placebo, baclofen resulted in a reduction in the number of reflux episodes per patient, the average length of reflux episodes, and the incidence of transient lower esophageal sphincter relaxation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-acid-reflux-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, the meta-analysis included patients with functional heartburn and reflux hypersensitivity. In one trial that included add-on therapy with baclofen, treatment significantly reduced the total number of non-acid reflux episodes regardless of the presence of a hiatal hernia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-acid-reflux-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2302335645\"><span class=\"h2\">Subsequent management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The subsequent approach to management depends upon the symptomatic response to treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1602834907\"><span class=\"h3\">Patients who respond to reflux inhibitors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with a symptomatic response to reflux inhibitor therapy (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=baclofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">baclofen</a>), we attempt to decrease the PPI dose, and if possible discontinue PPI therapy, over a four to eight-week interval.

In one study of 15 patients off PPI therapy before and seven months after laparoscopic Nissen-Rossetti fundoplication found that laparoscopic fundoplication improved acid reflux parameters (percent time pH &lt;4 and DeMeester score) and the total number of impedance-detected episodes of both acid and non-acid reflux (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F60423\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60423 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/non-acid-reflux-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>Laparoscopic fundoplication should be performed in high-volume centers of excellence.<strong> </strong>Patients must also be counseled on the limited data supporting laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication and difficulty in predicting which patients will respond to fundoplication.
