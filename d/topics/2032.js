Disseminated candidiasis is life threatening. The great majority of candidiasis is caused by <em>Candida albicans</em>. <em>C. albicans </em>is a common commensal organism in the oropharyngeal cavity, gastrointestinal tract, and vagina of humans but is capable of causing opportunistic infection following disruption of the normal flora, a breach of the mucocutaneous barrier, or a defect in host cellular immunity. <em>C. albicans</em> can be detected as normal flora in about 50 percent of individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The basic mycology and pathogenesis of candidiasis will be reviewed here. An overview of <em>Candida</em> infections and the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of candidemia and invasive candidiasis are presented separately; other forms of candidiasis are also discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-candida-infections\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of Candida infections&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-candidemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and pathogenesis of candidemia in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-candidemia-and-invasive-candidiasis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of candidemia and invasive candidiasis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-candidemia-and-invasive-candidiasis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of candidemia and invasive candidiasis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">MYCOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The genus <em>Candida</em> encompasses more than 350 species. They can be found among humans and other mammals, birds, insects, arthropods, fish, animal waste, plants, mushrooms, naturally occurring high-sugar substrates (eg, honey, nectar, grapes) and fermentation products, dairy products, soil, freshwater, seawater, and on airborne particles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>].</p><p>Infection in humans was first described as oral thrush by Hippocrates in the fifth century BC. In 1853, Charles Robin microscopically observed budding cells and filaments in epithelial scrapings, and he named the fungus <em>Oidium albicans</em>. Subsequently, more than 160 synonyms, including <em>Monilia albicans</em>, were used before <em>Candida albicans</em> became the accepted name for this species.</p><p>As many as 30 <em>Candida</em> species have caused infection in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The most common of these are <em>C. albicans</em>, <em>C. glabrata</em>, <em>C. krusei</em>, <em>C. parapsilosis</em>, and <em>C. tropicalis</em>. <em>C. parapsilosis</em> has been recognized as a heterogeneous species, and it was proposed that it be split into three morphologically and physiologically indistinguishable species: <em>C. parapsilosis</em>, <em>C. metapsilosis</em>, and <em>C. orthopsilosis</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Phylogenetic analyses show that <em>C. glabrata</em> is more closely related to <em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em> than to the <em>Candida albicans</em> group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>], and future taxonomic revision is possible.</p><p>In 1995, <em>Candida dubliniensis</em> was described as a new species to accommodate a subset of isolates previously identified as <em>C. albicans</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. <em>C. dubliniensis</em> is seen primarily among HIV-infected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. An environmental source for this species may be the digestive tract of marine birds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. There is no clear clinical or experimental evidence that significant pathogenicity differences exist between <em>C. albicans</em> and <em>C. dubliniensis</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], and it is not necessary to routinely distinguish <em>C. dubliniensis </em>from <em>C. albicans </em>in the clinical laboratory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p><em>Candida auris</em> was described as a new species after it was detected from a patient in Japan in 2009. In 2016, it was reported as a cause of infection in the United States and the United Kingdom. Since then, infections have been reported in over a dozen countries on five continents. <em>C. auris </em>is of particular concern because isolates cause serious infections, are often multidrug resistant, can be associated with outbreaks in healthcare facilities, and can be misidentified. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-candidemia-in-adults#H2316358869\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and pathogenesis of candidemia in adults&quot;, section on 'Emergence of C. auris'</a>.)</p><p>All of these clinically common species are diploid, except for the haploid <em>C. glabrata </em>and <em>C. krusei</em>. Of the aforementioned species, only <em>C. krusei</em> has been determined to have a classic heterothallic sexual cycle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, mating and genetic recombination does occur in <em>C. albicans</em>, <em>C. dubliniensis, </em>and <em>C. tropicalis </em>through a parasexual cycle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/9,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,15,16</a>]. An apparently similar mating mechanism exists in <em>C. dubliniensis</em>, and interspecific mating occurs between <em>C. albicans</em> and <em>C. dubliniensis</em> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Sequencing of the <em>C. albicans</em> genome has demonstrated that this species possesses 6354 genes contained in 8 chromosomes. These data will facilitate proteomic studies, which in turn could lead to better understanding of key biological characteristics of these species, including pathogen-host interactions, improved diagnostics, antifungal drug resistance, novel molecular targets for antifungal therapy, biofilm formation and dynamics, cell signaling, and responses to stress, nutrients, temperature, and pH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Growth, morphology, and pleomorphism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unlike the so-called systemic dimorphic fungi (eg, <em>Histoplasma capsulatum</em>), the morphology of a given <em>Candida</em> species is fundamentally the same whether observed in vitro or in vivo. <em>C. glabrata</em> grows as a small, elliptical, unicellular budding yeast at all times (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F61641\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61641 \">picture 1</a>). Rarely, buds of <em>C. glabrata</em> can adhere to one another in rudimentary short chains. In marked contrast, <em>C. albicans</em>, <em>C. krusei</em>, <em>C. parapsilosis</em>, and <em>C. tropicalis</em> form elliptical budding cells that typically are larger than those of <em>C. glabrata</em>; they can also form elaborate and well developed multicellular filaments (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F53369\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53369 \">picture 2</a>), particularly when in contact with a solid substrate, such as human tissue or agar culture media.</p><p><em>C. krusei</em> and <em>C. parapsilosis</em> can be considered dimorphic because they exhibit budding and pseudohyphal forms. <em>C. albicans</em> and <em>C. tropicalis</em> can form true hyphae (in addition to buds and pseudohyphae) and thus can be considered pleomorphic. Each of these species is capable of exhibiting budding <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> filamentous morphologies in infected tissue.</p><p>Usually, the presence of budding yeast and filaments in infected tissue is indicative of candidiasis. However, similar morphologies occur in infections caused by certain opportunistic molds (eg, <em>Paecilomyces lilacinus</em>). Histologic misdiagnosis of these mold infections as candidiasis can occur if histology is the sole diagnostic criterion used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/19-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-21</a>]. Correlation of histologic and culture results is recommended.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Pseudohyphae and hyphae</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pseudohyphae are morphologically and ontogenically distinct from hyphae. They are formed when buds remain attached to each other and subsequently elongate via differential rates of wall synthesis at various points along the cell wall. Elongation then stops and each terminal cell produces a new apical bud, which elongates in turn. This repeated process of budding and elongation can result in extensive filamentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Side branches initiate as buds and develop in the same manner. A constriction typically remains and can be seen at the origin of each bud (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F80723\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef80723 \">picture 3</a>). The branching process is regulated in part by a vacuolar protein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>] and by calcineurin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>In contrast, true hyphae elongate by a polarized growth process of apical synthesis that does not involve budding. Buds are not present at the hyphal tips; as a result, true hyphae do not exhibit the periodic constrictions that characterize pseudohyphae (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F76924\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef76924 \">picture 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. <em>C. albicans </em>hyphae have been shown to contain the Spitzenkorper, a vesicle-laden, actin-rich structure, well known in molds, that correlates with tip growth rate and direction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Hyphae develop by a process that is fundamentally different from that of pseudohyphal growth.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Septa</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Septa form by centripetal synthesis from the interior of the cell wall inward toward the center of the cell and are present in pseudohyphae, hyphae, and between mature bud cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. The septa provide internal support of the tubular filaments, and a central pore in each septum assures cytoplasmic continuity between cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">White-opaque switching</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to yeast, pseudohyphal, and hyphal forms, <em>C. albicans </em>exhibits two additional phenotypes: white and opaque colonies. Although genetically identical, the two phases differ in virulence and gene expression, and switching between phenotypes occurs at a known frequency although the extent to which environmental (including host) stimuli control switching is not fully known [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Opaque phase cells are prevalent as skin colonizers and are more readily killed by neutrophils, whereas white phase cells are more commonly associated with candidemia and are less susceptible to neutrophil defenses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Genetic control</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Signals that trigger each of the growth forms gradually are becoming better understood. Signals include pH, temperature, carbon and nitrogen availability, oxygenation, serum, hormones, and density of the <em>Candida</em> cells within the infected host [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/29-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-32</a>]. For example, one of the key factors, as indicated by studies of <em>C. albicans</em>, is pH of the microenvironment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. Several pH-regulated genes involved in growth and morphology have been identified: <em>PHR1</em> is expressed when the ambient pH is 5.5 or higher and correlates with filamentous growth, whereas <em>PHR2</em> is expressed when the ambient pH is lower than 5.5 (as in the vagina) and correlates with yeast-like growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Thus, the importance of these genes might vary according to the site of infection. For example, a null mutant of <em>PHR1</em> was avirulent in a mouse model of systemic infection (the systemic pH being well above 5.5) but maintained its ability to produce vaginal infection (where the pH is approximately 4.5). Conversely, a <em>PHR2</em> null mutant was able to cause systemic but not vaginal infection. Mutants without Phr1p, a protein product of the <em>PHR1</em> gene, also lack cross-linking activity associated with the cell wall glucan when grown at pH 8 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Adaptation of <em>C. albicans</em> to the neutral-alkaline environment of the human body by pH sensing is determined mainly by the RIM 101 signal transduction pathway [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>Several other genes have been identified which regulate the switch from the budding yeast to the filamentous form. Double mutants of <em>EFG1</em> and <em>CPH1</em> were nonfilamentous (ie, locked in the yeast form) and unable to form hyphae or pseudohyphae in response to stimuli, such as serum and macrophages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90), a repressor of hyphal development, can be partially compromised at 30&ordm;C, thus allowing hyphal initiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Several dozen genes have been shown to contribute to biofilm formation by <em>C. albicans</em>, and a role for quorum sensing molecules has been postulated as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-40</a>].</p><p>The gene <em>EFG1</em> encodes a protein Efg1 that contains conserved regions with homology to the human Myc protein; Efg1 appears to activate pseudohyphal formation and downregulate hyphal development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. In one study of <em>C. albicans</em>, the gene <em>CaRSR1</em>, a <em>RAS</em>-related gene, was necessary for budding and also contributed to germ tube emergence and cell elongation, which is part of the process of hyphal formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Alterations in the gene led to decreased virulence. G1 cyclins CLN1, CLN2, and CLN3 have been shown to play a key role in bud formation and regulation of yeast-hyphal transition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. Various protein kinases in the Cdc2 subfamily also have been shown to regulate filamentous growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. Tor1 is required for contact-dependent induction of <em>C. albicans</em> filaments on artificial surfaces and could be required in vivo as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. A role for quorum sensing as a signaling mechanism for hyphal development has also been suggested [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/31,48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,48,49</a>].</p><p>Both budding and filamentous forms presumably play a role in the progression of infection in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/19,20,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20,29</a>]. The ongoing formation and detachment of unicellular buds can facilitate hematogenous dissemination of the yeast following angioinvasion. In contrast, filamentation enhances the ability of <em>Candida</em> species to invade solid tissue via a burrowing process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Nonfilamentous <em>C. albicans</em> can be avirulent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Some investigators have suggested that the hyphae of <em>C. albicans</em> invade epithelial cells using thigmotropism (movement based upon touch) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/31,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,50</a>]. Others argue that chemotropism plays a more important role [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Detection in the microbiology laboratory</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cultures can be expected to grow within one to two days in most cases. The exception is <em>C. glabrata</em>, which may take several days to grow. Rapid presumptive identification of <em>C. albicans</em> can be made by observing the formation of germ tubes (the initiation of true hyphal growth) when incubated in proteinaceous liquid (eg, plasma) at 35&ordm;C for two to three hours (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F67784\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67784 \">picture 5</a>) or by rapid colorimetric detection of the enzymes L-proline aminopeptidase and beta-galactosaminidase (<em>C. albicans</em> Screen, Carr-Scarborough Microbiologicals, Inc). In addition, a chromogenic agar culture medium (Chromagar, Inc) has been developed that allows presumptive identification of <em>C. albicans</em>, <em>C. tropicalis</em>, and <em>C. krusei </em>(Chromagar, Inc) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F70584\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef70584 \">picture 6</a>), and a modified formula can distinguish <em>C. dubliniensis</em> as well [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. If necessary, isolates can be further characterized by conducting carbohydrate assimilation tests, which require two to three days. These nutritional tests use either manual kits or automated methods. Anaerobic growth (carbohydrate fermentations) also can be incorporated into an identification algorithm as needed, although few laboratories still do so. <em>C. dubliniensis</em> and <em>C. albicans</em> cannot be differentiated using most of the aforementioned methods, and further testing, such as assessing growth ability at 45&ordm;C (<em>C. albicans</em>) or performing nucleic acid sequence analysis, would be needed.</p><p>Definitive traditional identification of yeast species is based on a combination of morphologic features and physiologic testing. Under in vitro conditions, the filamentous morphologies of each of the common species are sufficiently distinctive that they should be used as an important criterion for species identification. Molecular sequence analysis for identification of isolates can also be readily accomplished and is highly accurate. However, in practice, the majority of clinical laboratories still base identification of <em>Candida</em> species on physiologic testing alone. More recently, matrix-assisted laser <span class=\"nowrap\">desorption/ionization&ndash;time</span> of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry offers the ability to accurately identify yeast isolates in minutes, without the need for mycological expertise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/53-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">53-55</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-candidemia-and-invasive-candidiasis-in-adults#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of candidemia and invasive candidiasis in adults&quot;, section on 'Blood cultures'</a>.)</p><p>As an alternative to cultures, nucleic acid detection of <em>Candida </em>species in blood specimens has received much attention, but it has not yet been integrated into the clinical laboratory. Some of the reasons for this include high equipment costs, labor-intensive sample preparation, and the need for technicians trained in molecular techniques. Another problem is high variation in reported test sensitivity, which has ranged from 58 to 100 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. One possible explanation for low test sensitivity is that DNA-based assays have generally reported a limit of detection of 5 to 10 cells, whereas most initial culture-positive blood specimens harbor one colony-forming unit or less per mL of blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]. RNA, which is present in far greater amounts than DNA targets, may offer a basis for more sensitive nucleic acid-based tests, but this requires further study.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Antigenic structure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The multilayered cell wall of <em>C. albicans</em> consists of glucans, mannans, mannoproteins, proteins, and chitin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/58-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">58-61</a>]. With the exception of glucans and chitin, which have little, if any, antigenicity, these products are capable of eliciting an immune response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>]. Glucan and chitin appear to lend mechanical strength and stability to the cell wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Strains deficient in one or more of these components are less virulent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/59,60,63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">59,60,63,64</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">VIRULENCE FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><em>Candida</em> species have little inherent virulence as illustrated by their ability to exist in a commensal relationship with humans and other animals. Despite this fact, the prevalence of <em>Candida</em> infections has increased in recent decades, and there is some evidence that the relative numbers of non-albicans<em> Candida</em> infections are increasing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. <em>C. albicans</em>, however, still causes the majority of infections. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-pathogenesis-of-candidemia-in-adults#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and pathogenesis of candidemia in adults&quot;, section on 'Prevalence of Candida species'</a>.)</p><p>Molecular genetic advances, such as microarray analysis, creation of gene knockout mutants, genome sequencing, and proteomic studies permit specific analysis of putative virulence factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. It is likely that there are numerous virulence factors, which may play different roles at various sites and stages of a given infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/1,66-68\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,66-68</a>]. As noted above, one such factor appears to be the ambient pH of the host [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. As another example, calcineurin (a calcium-regulated signaling enzyme) has been shown to be an important virulence factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/24,69,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,69,70</a>]. Calcineurin mutant strains showed no deficits in known virulence factors but were highly attenuated in a murine model of disseminated candidiasis. In addition, inhibition of calcineurin promotes susceptibility to azole antifungal compounds in vivo and in vitro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/71,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">71,72</a>]. More recently, the <em>GWT1</em> gene, which encodes an inositol acyltransferase needed for anchoring of fungal proteins to the fungal cell membrane, has been shown to be a potential gene target that could provide the basis for a new class of antifungal compounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>].</p><p>There also appear to be multiple adherence mechanisms that allow initial attachment to host tissue (or plastic foreign bodies) and subsequent proliferation. For example:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A hypha-specific surface protein, Hwp1, is needed to form stable attachments to epithelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].

On the other hand, expression of the <em>INT1</em> gene in <em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em> significantly promoted adhesion of this normally nonadherent yeast to human epithelial cells. Because the <em>INT1</em> protein is expressed on the exterior of the cell wall, it may be a promising candidate for targeted design of vaccines or therapeutic agents.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>C. albicans</em> deficient in mannosyl transferase demonstrated decreased adherence and virulence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p/><p>In vitro testing has suggested that the ability of <em>C. albicans </em>to synthesize trehalose provides protection against stress factors (such as thermal stress) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. In vivo testing of a trehalose synthase mutant strain showed attenuated virulence in a murine model of infection, supporting the further investigation of trehalose phosphate synthase as a potential antifungal compound target [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].</p><p><em>C. albicans</em> also produces extracellular proteinases, phospholipases, lipases, hydrolytic enzymes, and adhesins in vivo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/1,29,77-82\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,29,77-82</a>]. Among these possible virulence factors, protease-lacking mutants were less virulent than their wild-type parent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/1,25,83\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,25,83</a>]. Reduced virulence also was induced by deletion of the gene encoding for the production of phospholipase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>]. This defect did not appear to affect in vitro adhesion but was associated with diminished cell wall penetration. In a mouse model, the phospholipase-competent strain had a significantly greater ability to cross the gastric mucosal barrier and invade the kidneys and liver. Mutant strains that lack adhesion Hwp1 showed decreased virulence in an esophageal murine model of candidiasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. Ability to adapt to rapidly changing hypoxic conditions also may be a virulence factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/86,87\" class=\"abstract_t\">86,87</a>].</p><p>Sequencing of the <em>Candida albicans</em> genome has been completed. Comparative analysis to the nonpathogenic yeast <em>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</em> has shown that about 7 percent of genes in <em>C. albicans</em> have no homolog in <em>S. cerevisiae</em>. These genes appear to be of the kind that may be responsible for synthesis of adhesions and hydrolytic enzymes, which are believed to be virulence factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">GENETIC FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis is associated with the genetic conditions polyglandular autoimmune syndrome type I (APS1; the autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy [APECED]) syndrome and Job's (hyperimmunoglobulin E) syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>].

The cell-mediated immune response is clearly important in the host defense against <em>Candida</em>, as reflected by the higher prevalence of infections among individuals whose cellular immune systems are impaired, although the exact mechanisms of induction of this response have not been elucidated. Interleukin (IL)-12 appears to play an important role in the development of a Th1 response to <em>C. albicans</em> in the mouse; IL-12&ndash;deficient mice had increased susceptibility to infection introduced via the gastrointestinal tract and also to reinfection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>].

Several studies have shown that granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) increased neutrophil-mediated damage to pseudohyphae of <em>C. albicans</em>, perhaps in association with IFN-gamma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/92,93\" class=\"abstract_t\">92,93</a>].

However, recently developed polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies have shown a protective effect in a mouse model of candidiasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/97,98\" class=\"abstract_t\">97,98</a>]. Mannan-specific IgG antibodies have been shown to trigger both the classical and alternative complement pathways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>]. These findings suggest that development of a vaccine or short-term protective antibodies may be feasible. In both immunocompetent and immunocompromised mice, a vaccine against <em>C. albicans</em> conferred reduced fungal burden and improved survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/100\" class=\"abstract_t\">100</a>]. Toll-like receptors, mainly TLR2 and TLR4, play a key role in recognition of <em>C. albicans</em> and the activation of the host immune response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>]. In addition, the non-toll-like receptor, Dectin-1, has been shown to induce host cellular responses following recognition of beta-glucan of the fungal cell wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biology-of-candida-infections/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1206538028\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Candidiasis refers to the range of infections caused by species of the fungal genus <em>Candida</em>; these infections can be acute or chronic, localized or systemic. Disseminated candidiasis is life threatening. The great majority of candidiasis is caused by <em>Candida albicans</em>. <em>C. albicans</em> is a common commensal organism in the oropharyngeal cavity, gastrointestinal tract, and vagina of humans but is capable of causing opportunistic infection following disruption of the normal flora, a breach of the mucocutaneous barrier, or a defect in host cellular immunity. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As many as 30 <em>Candida</em> species have caused infection in humans. The most common of these are <em>C. albicans</em>, <em>C. glabrata</em>, <em>C. krusei</em>, <em>C. parapsilosis</em>, and <em>C. tropicalis</em>. <em>C. auris </em>was first identified as a cause of infections in 2011 and is often multidrug resistant and is associated with outbreaks in healthcare facilities. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Mycology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unlike the so-called systemic dimorphic fungi (eg, <em>Histoplasma capsulatum</em>), the morphology of a given <em>Candida</em> species is fundamentally the same whether observed in vitro or in vivo. <em>C. glabrata</em> grows as a small, elliptical, unicellular budding yeast at all times (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F61641\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61641 \">picture 1</a>). In marked contrast, <em>C. albicans</em>, <em>C. krusei</em>, <em>C. parapsilosis</em>, and <em>C. tropicalis</em> form elliptical budding cells that typically are larger than those of <em>C. glabrata</em>; they can also form elaborate and well-developed multicellular filaments (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F53369\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53369 \">picture 2</a>), particularly when in contact with a solid substrate, such as human tissue or agar culture media. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Growth, morphology, and pleomorphism'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of budding yeast and filaments in infected tissue is usually indicative of candidiasis. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Growth, morphology, and pleomorphism'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cultures can be expected to grow overnight in most cases. Rapid presumptive identification of <em>C. albicans</em> can be made by observing the formation of germ tubes (the initiation of true hyphal growth) when incubated in proteinaceous liquid (eg, plasma) at 35&ordm;C for two to three hours (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F67784\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef67784 \">picture 5</a>) or by rapid colorimetric detection of the enzymes L-proline aminopeptidase and beta-galactosaminidase. Definitive traditional identification of yeast species is based on a combination of morphologic features and physiologic testing but could be replaced by alternative methods such as matrix-assisted laser <span class=\"nowrap\">desorption/ionization&ndash;time</span> of flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Detection in the microbiology laboratory'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><em>Candida</em> species have little inherent virulence as illustrated by their ability to exist in a commensal relationship with humans and other animals. Nevertheless, several virulence factors have been identified, including the ambient pH of the host, calcineurin, and various adherence mechanisms. Progress in the identification of virulence factors and important genes holds promise for the development of new classes of antifungal compounds. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Virulence factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis is associated with the genetic conditions polyglandular autoimmune syndrome type I (APS1; the autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy [APECED]) syndrome and Job's (hyperimmunoglobulin E) syndrome. Other genetic mutations have also been associated with mucocutaneous <em>Candida</em> infections in familial clusters. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Genetic factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cell wall constituents in <em>Candida</em> species can evoke both humoral and cellular host immune responses during the course of infection. In addition, extracellular proteinases of <em>C. albicans</em> trigger immune responses locally and systemically. The cell-mediated immune response is clearly important in the host defense against <em>Candida</em>, as reflected by the higher prevalence of infections among individuals whose cellular immune systems are impaired.
