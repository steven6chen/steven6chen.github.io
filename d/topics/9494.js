This blockage causes a lack of blood flow to portions of the brain, which is called ischemia (literally, lack of blood).</p><p>During a stroke, one or more areas of the brain can be damaged. Depending upon the area affected, a person may lose the ability to move one side of the body, the ability to speak, the ability to see normally, or a number of other functions. The damage may be temporary or permanent, and the function may be partially or completely lost. A person's long term outcome depends upon how much brain is damaged, how quickly treatment begins, and a number of other factors.</p><p>Strokes are a leading cause of long-lasting injury, disability, and death. Early treatment and preventive measures can reduce the brain damage that occurs as a result of a stroke. The treatment of a stroke depends upon the type of stroke (eg, ischemic or hemorrhagic), the time since the first stroke symptoms occurred, and the patient's underlying medical problems. General information about the treatment of ischemic strokes is provided here.</p><p>A separate topic review is available that discusses the signs, symptoms, and diagnosis of ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stroke-symptoms-and-diagnosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Stroke symptoms and diagnosis (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A topic is also available that discusses the treatment of hemorrhagic stroke. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemorrhagic-stroke-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Hemorrhagic stroke treatment (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">VERY EARLY TREATMENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For people who have an ischemic stroke, the goal of treatment is to restore blood flow to the affected area of the brain as quickly as possible, which means within the first hours after the stroke begins. The main very early treatments for ischemic stroke are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intravenous thrombolytic (&quot;clot buster&quot;) therapy with alteplase</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intra-arterial mechanical thrombectomy (opening of the blocked artery) with stent retriever devices</p><p/><p>Both thrombolytic therapy and mechanical thrombectomy require care in a hospital that can coordinate emergency services, rapid consultation with a neurologist (a physician who specializes in the brain), intensive care services, and brain and vascular imaging with CT or MRI scans. Not all hospitals are able to provide all these services. In this situation it may be necessary to transfer the patient to a hospital that can. Intravenous thrombolytic therapy is available at many more hospitals than intra-arterial mechanical thrombectomy because intra-arterial therapy is highly specialized. It should only be performed at a hospital with expertise in the use of stent retrievers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Alteplase (thrombolytic therapy)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intravenous thrombolytic therapy uses a medication called tissue plasminogen activator (tPA, alteplase) that is injected into a vein. Alteplase works to dissolve clots that are blocking blood flow within arteries of the brain. The benefit of thrombolytic treatment slowly decreases over several hours. Thus, the earlier the treatment is given after the stroke begins, the more likely the artery can be opened.</p><p>Overall, it is estimated that alteplase treatment is 10 times more likely to help than to harm. However, approximately 1 in 15 patients who receive thrombolytic therapy develops excessive bleeding (hemorrhage) in the brain; this type of bleeding can be fatal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7298666\"><span class=\"h2\">Mechanical thrombectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This is a procedure that can help in certain situations (when the person has a blockage in one of the large arteries in the brain). It involves inserting a catheter with a &quot;stent retriever&quot; into the artery to remove the clot that is causing stroke symptoms. This treatment can reduce long-term disability caused by the stroke.</p><p>Mechanical thrombectomy is beneficial if it is given within six hours from the start of the stroke symptoms. It may also have a benefit for some patients if given between 6 and 24 hours of symptom onset; however, the sooner it is done, the more likely it is to help.</p><p>Mechanical thrombectomy for stroke is a highly specialized treatment and should only be performed at hospitals with experience in the use of stent retrievers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanical-thrombectomy-for-acute-ischemic-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanical thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7298680\"><span class=\"h1\">OTHER EARLY TREATMENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The medicines used for the early treatment of ischemic stroke are aspirin and anticoagulants.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Aspirin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antiplatelet therapy helps prevent new clots from developing. Unlike thrombolytic drugs, these agents do not dissolve clots that are already present. They are often used acutely if thrombolytic drugs cannot be given or after thrombolytics have been given.</p><p>Aspirin is the only antiplatelet agent that has been established as effective for the early treatment of acute ischemic stroke. Thus, doctors may use early aspirin therapy (within 48 hours of the start of stroke symptoms) for patients with ischemic stroke who are not receiving anticoagulants. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antithrombotic-treatment-of-acute-ischemic-stroke-and-transient-ischemic-attack#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antithrombotic treatment of acute ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack&quot;, section on 'Antiplatelet agents'</a>.)</p><p>Platelets are tiny cell fragments circulating in the blood that normally clump together to stop bleeding. This clumping leads to the formation of a blood clot. In strokes, platelets clump together and form clots inside of narrowed arteries. The platelet &quot;plug&quot; itself <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> the clot that forms around the plug can block blood flow in the brain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14511937\"><span class=\"h2\">Anticoagulants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anticoagulants are often, but incorrectly, referred to as blood thinners. They work by decreasing the formation of additional blood clots. Heparin and low molecular weight heparin are anticoagulants.</p><p>Because of the risk of excessive bleeding, anticoagulation is seldom given for the treatment of patients with acute ischemic stroke. However, anticoagulant therapy with heparin or low molecular weight heparin is used by some practitioners for certain types of stroke. For example, some doctors use anticoagulants for the early treatment of stroke caused by blood clots that travel from the heart (cardioembolism) in patients who have heart valve disease or severe heart failure, and for patients who have stroke caused by dissection (a tear of the inner blood vessel wall) of a large artery that supplies blood to the brain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antithrombotic-treatment-of-acute-ischemic-stroke-and-transient-ischemic-attack#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antithrombotic treatment of acute ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack&quot;, section on 'Anticoagulation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14511908\"><span class=\"h1\">LONG TERM PREVENTION OF ISCHEMIC STROKE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For people who have already had an ischemic stroke, doctors often prescribe medicines that can reduce the chance of having another stroke. This is called secondary prevention. The treatments for secondary prevention of ischemic stroke include antiplatelet medications, anticoagulants, and surgical procedures to reopen blockages in blood vessels (revascularization).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14511916\"><span class=\"h2\">Antiplatelet therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The antiplatelet medicines aspirin, clopidogrel, and the combination of aspirin plus extended-release dipyridamole (Aggrenox) are all acceptable options for preventing recurrent ischemic stroke for patients other than those who have a stroke caused by embolism from the heart. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antiplatelet-therapy-for-secondary-prevention-of-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention of stroke&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3671499248\"><span class=\"h3\">Aspirin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aspirin (even at relatively low doses) is effective for preventing ischemic stroke. It is used as first-line treatment after a noncardioembolic stroke (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Aspirin'</a> above), and may be continued longer term or switched to a different antiplatelet agent. Aspirin has the advantage of being less expensive than the other antiplatelet medications. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antiplatelet-therapy-for-secondary-prevention-of-stroke#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention of stroke&quot;, section on 'Aspirin'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Clopidogrel</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clopidogrel (Plavix) is an antiplatelet medication that is also used in patients after stroke to reduce the risk of having another stroke. In one trial, the combined risk of stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), or vascular death, was modestly reduced with clopidogrel treatment compared with aspirin treatment. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antiplatelet-therapy-for-secondary-prevention-of-stroke#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention of stroke&quot;, section on 'Clopidogrel'</a>.)</p><p>Compared with aspirin, clopidogrel causes a slightly higher frequency of rash and diarrhea, and a slightly lower frequency of stomach upset and gastrointestinal bleeding.</p><p>In some cases, aspirin and clopidogrel are used together for the first 90 days after an ischemic stroke. This strategy is called &quot;dual antiplatelet therapy.&quot; After 90 days, however, the treatment is changed so that only one of these antiplatelet medications is continued. Long-term treatment using clopidogrel in combination with aspirin is not usually recommended after a stroke because the combination is no more effective for preventing another stroke than either clopidogrel or aspirin alone, while using the two in combination increases the risk of bleeding in the brain. However, selected patients with a recent acute myocardial infarction, other acute coronary syndrome, or recent arterial stent placement are often treated with the combination of clopidogrel plus aspirin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1433701711\"><span class=\"h3\">Dipyridamole</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dipyridamole is a medication that may be given after a stroke to reduce the risk of another stroke. It is often given in an extended-release form, which combines dipyridamole with aspirin (called Aggrenox). It is taken two times per day. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antiplatelet-therapy-for-secondary-prevention-of-stroke#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antiplatelet therapy for secondary prevention of stroke&quot;, section on 'Dipyridamole'</a>.)</p><p>Side effects of dipyridamole include headache, stomach upset, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diarrhea. Headaches usually improve over the first week.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Anticoagulant therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Anticoagulant therapy is used to prevent stroke for selected patients. As an example, for long-term stroke prevention, virtually all patients with a heart rhythm problem called atrial fibrillation who have a history of embolic stroke or transient ischemic attack should be treated with anticoagulation (warfarin or one of the newer oral anticoagulant drugs) in the absence of contraindications.</p><p>Warfarin (Coumadin) is a pill that is taken by mouth. It is often recommended as a long-term treatment for people who have conditions that promote the formation of blood clots, such as atrial fibrillation of the heart. People who take warfarin must be closely monitored with blood tests to ensure that the correct dose is used and that the risk of excessive bleeding or developing blood clots is minimized. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-coumadin-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Warfarin (Coumadin) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Dabigatran (Pradaxa), apixaban (Eliquis), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), and edoxaban (Savaysa, Lixiana) are newer anticoagulants that work as well as warfarin, and are as safe, but do not require periodic blood tests. Patients should discuss with their doctors whether one of these newer agents is better for them than warfarin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Revascularization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Revascularization is the medical term for reestablishing blood flow to an area. In people who have had a stroke, revascularization usually refers to a surgical procedure (carotid endarterectomy) that opens a blocked artery in the neck (the carotid artery), which improves blood flow to the brain and reduces the risk of stroke. The amount of blockage in the carotid artery can be measured with an ultrasound imaging test, CT angiogram, MR angiogram, or conventional arteriogram. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stroke-symptoms-and-diagnosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Stroke symptoms and diagnosis (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Carotid endarterectomy is most successful when it is performed by a vascular surgeon who has specialized training and experience with the procedure. However, even in experienced hands, the procedure has risks, including bleeding, brain injury, stroke, and even death. Some people are likely to benefit from carotid endarterectomy while for others, the risks of the procedure are greater than the potential benefits. Placement of a stent in the carotid artery is another alternative, although this therapy carries a greater risk of stroke and disability, especially in people over the age of 70 years. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-symptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of symptomatic carotid atherosclerotic disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-asymptomatic-carotid-atherosclerotic-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of asymptomatic carotid atherosclerotic disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS AFTER STROKE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of problems can develop in people who have had a stroke. These complications are significant because approximately half of deaths after stroke are due to medical complications. In the days and weeks after a stroke, clinicians, the patient, and family members can work to decrease the risk of some of these complications. Common complications include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood clots</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Difficulty eating and drinking, which increases the risk of pneumonia and malnutrition</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pneumonia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urinary tract infection</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding in the digestive system</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Falls</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart attack or heart failure</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bed sores</p><p/><p>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-complications-of-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical complications of stroke&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stroke-related-pulmonary-complications-and-abnormal-respiratory-patterns\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stroke-related pulmonary complications and abnormal respiratory patterns&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiac-complications-of-stroke\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiac complications of stroke&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Blood clots</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People who have strokes are at an increased risk of developing blood clots as they recover. A deep vein thrombosis (DVT) is a blood clot that develops in the deep veins of the leg. If the clot breaks off, it can travel to the lung, where it is called a pulmonary embolus (PE). A PE can cause serious, and potentially fatal, changes in blood flow throughout the body. These blood clots occur most often between the second and seventh day after the stroke.</p><p>The risk of pulmonary embolism is especially high in stroke patients who have difficulty with moving or walking around during the recovery period. Difficulty walking may be related to paralysis caused by the stroke or to other medical conditions. Lack of movement increases the risk of a deep vein thrombosis. Advanced age also increases the risk.</p><p>Treatments to prevent blood clots in patients who have difficulty moving or walking after a recent stroke include intermittent pneumatic compression devices and anticoagulation. Intermittent pneumatic compression devices use an inflatable sleeve that wraps around the legs; the sleeves are attached to an air pump that inflates and deflates the sleeves at regular intervals to help increase venous flow in the leg veins. Anticoagulation generally involves the temporary use of heparin or low molecular weight heparin. These treatments can help to prevent a blood clot in a deep vein of the leg or a blood clot that travels to the lung (called a pulmonary embolism). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deep-vein-thrombosis-dvt-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Use of an anticoagulant to prevent blood clots is different that anticoagulation used for treatment of an ischemic stroke; the dose used for prevention is typically smaller than that used to treat stroke.</p><p>To decrease the risk of blood clots, the patient is encouraged to get up and move around frequently as soon as they are able to do so. A physical therapist is often available to help, especially if the patient has weakness in the legs as a result of the stroke.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Difficulty swallowing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The act of swallowing requires coordination of the nerves and muscles of the tongue, mouth, and throat. The brain damage that occurs as a result of a stroke can cause muscle weakness and difficulty swallowing. Dysphagia is the medical term for difficulty swallowing.</p><p>Dysphagia is concerning because it increases the risk of inhaling saliva or food into the lungs, which can cause a type of pneumonia known as aspiration pneumonia. Patients with stroke-related pneumonia have a higher risk of death and a poorer long-term outcome when compared to patients without pneumonia. However, in people who have weakness of one side of the body, dysphagia is often temporary because both sides of the brain and body control swallowing.</p><p>To determine if a patient is at risk for inhaling food or drinks into the lungs, a simple water swallow test may be done. If the patient has difficulty swallowing water, the clinician may recommend that the patient not eat or drink anything temporarily. In the meantime, medication and nutrition can be given into a vein. Specific exercises and training programs can help to retrain a person how to swallow despite muscle or nerve damage. An additive to thicken liquids may be recommended.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Urinary tract infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Urinary tract infections are a common complication after stroke, occurring in about 11 percent of patients during the first three months after stroke. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-complications-of-stroke#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical complications of stroke&quot;, section on 'Urinary tract infection'</a>.)</p><p>After a stroke, some men and women have difficulty getting out of bed to empty their bladder. Others have difficulty with urinary leakage or are not able to empty their bladder completely because of muscle weakness. For these reasons, a catheter is often placed inside the bladder, especially during the first few days to weeks after a stroke. However, there is an increased risk of urinary tract infections related to the use of a catheter.</p><p>There are a number of strategies that can decrease the risk of urinary tract infections in patients who require a catheter. A few of these strategies are listed below:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use a catheter only when necessary.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Remove the catheter as soon as possible.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is not necessary to change the catheter to prevent infections. The catheter should only be changed if it begins to crack or deteriorate or if the patient has a urinary tract infection.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For men, there is a lower risk of infections with a condom-type catheter.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are not good data to support using antibiotics to prevent infection during catheter use. Antibiotics are recommended to treat a urinary tract infection if it develops.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Nutrition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After a stroke, some patients have difficulty consuming an adequate number of calories. In addition, some patients are underweight or malnourished before their stroke. These problems can interfere with a person's ability to recover from stroke, potentially increasing the risk of long-term disability.</p><p>For these reasons, a patient's nutritional status should be evaluated before discharge from the hospital. This includes a review of the patient's past and current body weight, a basic history of the patient's eating habits, blood testing, and a physical examination that focuses on the condition of the eyes, hair, skin, mouth, and muscles.</p><p>If a person is not able to consume an adequate number of calories, a feeding tube may be placed through the nose and into the stomach (called a nasogastric tube). If the feeding tube will be needed for more than two to three weeks, a tube can be inserted through the abdomen into the stomach This type of tube is called a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube. The PEG tube may be removed if the person regains the ability to eat normally.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">GI bleeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who have had a severe stroke, especially those who are in the intensive care unit and require a ventilator to breathe, have an increased risk of developing a bleeding ulcer in the stomach. To lower this risk, a medication can be given to lower the stomach's production of acid.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h2\">Heart problems</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Heart problems, such as an irregular heart rhythm (called an arrhythmia) or heart attack (called a myocardial infarction) are commonly seen following stroke, with some heart problems occurring in up to 70 percent of people. It is important to determine whether the heart problems are caused by the stroke, unrelated to it, or the cause of the stroke.</p><p>Tests often performed to screen for these problems include an electrocardiogram (ECG), blood testing, and continuous monitoring of the heart rhythm (called telemetry). Because a large number of people with ischemic strokes also have coronary artery disease, there is a risk of ischemia (lack of blood flow) in the heart during the stroke. In some cases, the person may not be able to tell the clinician that he or she feels chest pain. The ECG will help the clinician to diagnose and treat heart problems as quickly as possible.</p><p>Other heart testing may also be recommended, such as an echocardiogram. This test uses sound waves to examine the heart and the aorta (the large vessel that arises directly from the heart); blood vessels that supply the brain with blood originate from the aorta (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F74006\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74006 \">figure 1</a>). In some people with embolic strokes, the heart or the aorta is the source of the blood clot that led to the stroke.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h2\">Bed sores</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bed sores are areas of skin and underlying tissue that are injured when compressed between a bone (eg, tail bone) and an external surface (eg, a mattress) for a prolonged period of time. Other names for bed sores are pressure sores and decubitus ulcers.</p><p>The consequences of this type of skin injury range from mild skin redness to deep ulcers extending down to the bone. The ulcer can be uncomfortable and increases the risk of infection for the patient and also potentially increases the healthcare costs and hospital stay.</p><p>Bed sores are common in people with a limited ability to move without assistance, and may be preventable by moving or turning (or being moved by a family member or nurse) at least every two hours. It is recommended that:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should be placed at a 30 degree angle when lying on their side to avoid direct pressure over the hip bone (greater trochanter).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pillows or foam wedges may need to be placed between the ankles and knees to avoid pressure at these sites.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The heels require particular attention; pillows may be placed under the lower legs to elevate the heels, or special heel protectors can be used.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elevation of the head of the bed should be limited.</p><p/><p>Chair-bound patients may generate considerable pressures over the sit bones (ischial tuberosities); they should probably be repositioned at least every hour.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Falls</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After a stroke, many people have difficulty walking due to muscle weakness, paralysis, or lack of coordination. When a person becomes less active or unable to walk, they are at increased risk of bone thinning (osteoporosis) and worsened muscle weakness. These risks greatly increase the chance of breaking a bone after a fall. Falls are one of the most common complications of stroke, occurring in up to 25 percent of patients.</p><p>To reduce the risk of falls, several interventions may be helpful:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscle strengthening and balance retraining exercises &ndash; This may include exercise or rehabilitation programs tailored to an individual's needs and abilities. Group classes, such as Tai Chi, may be helpful for patients who are able to walk without assistance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation of fall risk &ndash; An evaluation may be recommended to determine if a person is at risk for falling.
