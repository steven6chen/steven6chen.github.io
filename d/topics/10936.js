Methadone substitution therapy has many potential benefits during pregnancy and postpartum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F55718\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef55718 \">table 1</a>). Nevertheless, several barriers to methadone treatment exist, including lack of health insurance, incarceration, transportation and childcare needs, guilt about the effect of drugs on the fetus, and fear of legal consequences, including loss of custody of children.</p><p>This topic will review management of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a> substitution therapy in pregnant and postpartum women. The choice of methadone versus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=buprenorphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">buprenorphine</a> substitution therapy and management of buprenorphine substitution therapy are discussed separately.

In opioid substitution therapy, the opioid is administered in doses sufficient to prevent symptoms of withdrawal and reduce or eliminate drug craving. In medical withdrawal, the opioid dose is gradually reduced to the lowest dose that prevents withdrawal symptoms and then reduced further until the drug can be discontinued. Maintenance psychosocial interventions, which follow opioid withdrawal, include addiction counseling, peer support groups, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> structured, multi-modal approaches.

In nonpregnant patients treated for opioid use disorder, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a> treatment has shown greater efficacy in reducing opioid use and maintaining abstinence compared with medically supervised withdrawal followed by non-drug psychosocial treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methadone-substitution-therapy-of-opioid-use-disorder-during-pregnancy/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>].

However, we consider several factors when counseling women about their options, and the choice of drug (methadone versus buprenorphine) is a shared decision.

The psychosocial history is also important: In one report, 83 percent of women entering <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a> treatment programs came from households in which parents used drugs, 67 percent had been victims of sexual assault, and 60 percent had been physically assaulted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methadone-substitution-therapy-of-opioid-use-disorder-during-pregnancy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. </p><p>We agree with the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' recommendation for screening for depression and other behavioral health conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methadone-substitution-therapy-of-opioid-use-disorder-during-pregnancy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>] as co-occurring mental health conditions are common.

We suggest hospitalization during initiation of treatment because of the potential for serious adverse events, such as overdose and adverse drug interactions. This is also an ideal time for assessment by a social worker and case manager and for initiation of prenatal care. However, other authorities believe hospitalization is not necessary at initiation of therapy.</p><p>The starting <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a> dose depends on the patient's symptoms; however, if the diagnosis of opioid use disorder is clear, there is no legal requirement that the patient demonstrate signs and symptoms of withdrawal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F78130\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef78130 \">table 3</a>) initiating methadone. Signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal typically appear 4 to 6 hours after the last dose of short-acting opioids, peak at one to three days (onset of and peak symptoms may occur later after long-acting opioids) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methadone-substitution-therapy-of-opioid-use-disorder-during-pregnancy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>] and include one or more of the following: dysphoria, restlessness, rhinorrhea, lacrimation, myalgias, arthralgias, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramping, diarrhea, mydriasis (pupillary dilation), yawning, increased bowel sounds, piloerection. The severity of each symptom depends on the individual's tolerance to opioids, the continued presence of opioid in the serum and end organs, and the duration of time over which withdrawal has occurred. Withdrawal symptoms generally subside after five to seven days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methadone-substitution-therapy-of-opioid-use-disorder-during-pregnancy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

After the initial methadone dose, incremental doses of 5 to 10 mg are given every three to six hours as needed to treat withdrawal symptoms (described above) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/methadone-substitution-therapy-of-opioid-use-disorder-during-pregnancy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].
