CMV infections in immunocompromised patients cause substantial morbidity and mortality, especially among transplant recipients and those infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Infection in the immunocompetent host is generally asymptomatic or may present as a mononucleosis syndrome. However, occasionally, primary CMV infection can lead to severe organ-specific complications with significant morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-cytomegalovirus-infection-in-immunocompetent-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Infection of pregnant women, even if asymptomatic, is occasionally associated with the syndrome of congenital CMV in newborns.

Productive (lytic) infection leads to the synthesis of immediate-early, early, and late viral proteins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-cytomegalovirus-infection-in-immunocompetent-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Viral DNA has been detected in monocytes, dendritic cells, megakaryocytes, and myeloid progenitor cells in the bone marrow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-cytomegalovirus-infection-in-immunocompetent-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Secondary, symptomatic disease may present later in the life of the host, reflecting one of two possibilities: reactivation of latent CMV or reinfection with a novel exogenous strain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-cytomegalovirus-infection-in-immunocompetent-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. One prospective study of 205 postpartum seropositive women found that approximately one-third of the participants had CMV reinfection over a mean of 35 months of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-cytomegalovirus-infection-in-immunocompetent-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In this study, reinfection was determined by the appearance of new antibodies with strain-specific binding to unique polymorphic determinants on the envelope glycoprotein of cytomegalovirus. A similar frequency of reinfection was noted in a study of healthy seropositive women over 30 months of follow-up; furthermore, CMV viremia and viruria were common, suggesting that naturally acquired immunity to CMV does not alter shedding patterns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-cytomegalovirus-infection-in-immunocompetent-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Reactivation of CMV may occur at any time during the life of the human host, although the risk is higher in the setting of systemic immunosuppression, either iatrogenic or secondary to underlying medical conditions, such as the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). As an example, in one study, glucocorticoid use was associated with an increased risk of CMV colitis in otherwise immunocompetent adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-cytomegalovirus-infection-in-immunocompetent-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>The bulk of CMV-related disease in immunocompetent hosts is related to primary infection.

High frequencies of specific cytomegalovirus CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses have been demonstrated in immunocompetent hosts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-cytomegalovirus-infection-in-immunocompetent-adults/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Using cytokine flow cytometry and overlapping peptides comprising more than 200 CMV open reading frames (ORFs), researchers have been able to demonstrate that 151 ORFs are immunogenic for CD4+ and CD8+ T cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-cytomegalovirus-infection-in-immunocompetent-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Furthermore, CMV-specific T cell responses are typically robust. In one study, CMV-specific T cell responses involved approximately 10 percent of both CD4+ and CD8+ memory cells within the peripheral blood of CMV-seropositive individuals, whereas, in CMV-seronegative individuals, cross-reactive T cell recognition of CMV proteins was limited to CD8+ T cells and was rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-cytomegalovirus-infection-in-immunocompetent-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The proportion of humans with evidence of prior cytomegalovirus infection varies throughout the world, with seroprevalence rates ranging between 40 and 100 percent of the adult population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-cytomegalovirus-infection-in-immunocompetent-adults/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Seroprevalence generally correlates inversely with a country's socioeconomic development, with highest rates observed in developing countries throughout Africa and Asia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-cytomegalovirus-infection-in-immunocompetent-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>The prevalence of CMV-specific antibody increases with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-cytomegalovirus-infection-in-immunocompetent-adults/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>]. As an example, in a study from Finland, the seroprevalence rates were 47 percent in 10- to 12-year-olds, 68 percent in 15- to 35-year-olds, and 81 percent among 36- to 60-year-olds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-cytomegalovirus-infection-in-immunocompetent-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

Further studies are necessary to establish this possible association and, if validated, elucidate the biologic mechanisms underlying it.</p><p>In contrast with the studies described above, in a retrospective study that evaluated the impact of CMV serostatus on outcomes in immunocompetent intensive care unit (ICU) patients, on multivariable analysis, there was no association between CMV seropositivity and ICU mortality, which was the primary end point of the study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-cytomegalovirus-infection-in-immunocompetent-adults/abstract/115\" class=\"abstract_t\">115</a>]. There was also no association between CMV seropositivity and any of the secondary end points, which included in-hospital mortality, time to discharge from the ICU or hospital, time to wean from mechanical ventilation, and the need for renal replacement therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">REACTIVATION IN CRITICALLY ILL PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cytomegalovirus reactivation occurs commonly in critically ill patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-cytomegalovirus-infection-in-immunocompetent-adults/abstract/116-126\" class=\"abstract_t\">116-126</a>].

Viremia was detected at a median of 12 days following ICU admission and persisted for 3 to 57 days (median 17 days).</p><p>In a separate prospective study assessing the impact of CMV reactivation on outcomes of CMV-seropositive immunocompetent patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), CMV viremia was observed by PCR in 74 of 271 patients (27 percent) when tested weekly during the first 30 days of admission and was associated with increased overall mortality and reduced successful ventilator weaning rate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-cytomegalovirus-infection-in-immunocompetent-adults/abstract/125\" class=\"abstract_t\">125</a>]. Another study has shown an association between CMV reactivation and mortality in immunocompetent patients with septic shock [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-cytomegalovirus-infection-in-immunocompetent-adults/abstract/126\" class=\"abstract_t\">126</a>].</p><p>Other studies have had conflicting results. As an example, in a prospective study of immunocompetent patients admitted to an intensive care unit, evidence of CMV reactivation was detected in 11 of 80 patients (14 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-cytomegalovirus-infection-in-immunocompetent-adults/abstract/124\" class=\"abstract_t\">124</a>]. CMV reactivation was defined as the detection of &ge;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">copies/mL</span> of CMV DNA from the plasma by real-time PCR; samples were obtained upon admission to the ICU and weekly thereafter until day 28 of illness. The most significant risk factors for reactivation were the number of transfused units of packed red blood cells and higher levels of C-reactive protein at the time of admission. Patients with CMV reactivation had higher quantified Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores during the entire 28-day observation period. The patients with reactivation had no differences in ICU length of stay, duration of mechanical ventilation, or overall mortality when compared with patients without evidence of CMV viremia during their ICU stay. In another prospective study that included 306 immunocompetent, critically ill CMV-seropositive patients with ARDS, CMV reactivation was observed in 53 of 209 patients (26 percent) but it was not associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation or increased mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-treatment-of-cytomegalovirus-infection-in-immunocompetent-adults/abstract/123\" class=\"abstract_t\">123</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H889157397\"><span class=\"h1\">PROPHYLAXIS AGAINST REACTIVATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To date, there is no evidence that prophylaxis or suppression of CMV viremia in critically ill patients leads to improved outcomes.

Antiviral prophylaxis was associated with a reduced incidence of CMV reactivation (12 versus 39 percent). However, there was no difference between the groups in interleukin (IL-) 6 levels (the primary outcome) nor were there differences between the groups in incidence of secondary bacteremia or fungemia, intensive care unit (ICU) length of stay, or mortality. IL-6, a pro-inflammatory cytokine, was chosen as the primary end point because it has been associated with mortality in ICU patients; in addition, preliminary studies have linked CMV reactivation with increased IL-6 levels, and it was expected that the trial might detect a difference for this endpoint.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h1\">THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most cases of primary cytomegalovirus infection in immunocompetent hosts are associated with minimal or no symptoms. Among patients with symptomatic CMV infection, especially the mononucleosis syndrome, the illness is generally self-limited, with complete recovery over a period of days to weeks. Antiviral therapy is not usually indicated.</p><p>Currently, there are several agents available for the systemic therapy of CMV infection, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ganciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ganciclovir</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=valganciclovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">valganciclovir</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=foscarnet-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">foscarnet</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cidofovir-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cidofovir</a>.

Doses of the drugs and the duration of therapy also have not been clarified for this group of patients. Since severe CMV infections in this population are rare, it is unlikely that a prospective randomized trial will ever be performed comparing antiviral therapy with placebo. Thus, the severity and potential morbidity of CMV disease must be balanced against the risk of medication toxicity (eg, bone marrow toxicity) in deciding whether or not to use antivirals in an individual immunocompetent patient.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.
