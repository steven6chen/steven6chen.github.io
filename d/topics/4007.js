GCA is designated as a vasculitis of this caliber because it can involve the aorta and great vessels, and because it shares some histopathologic features with Takayasu arteritis, the other major &ldquo;large vessel&rdquo; vasculitis. Systemic symptoms are common in GCA and vascular involvement can be widespread. However, it is the targeting of the tiny muscular arteries from cranial branches of the aortic arch that gives rise to many of the most characteristic symptoms of GCA. The most feared complication of GCA, visual loss, is one potential consequence of such cranial arteritis.</p><p>The clinical manifestations of GCA will be reviewed here. The pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of this disorder are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-giant-cell-arteritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of giant cell arteritis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-giant-cell-arteritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of giant cell arteritis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-giant-cell-arteritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of giant cell arteritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is the most common systemic vasculitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-giant-cell-temporal-arteritis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In the United States population, the lifetime risk of developing GCA has been estimated at approximately 1 percent in women and 0.5 percent in men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-giant-cell-temporal-arteritis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The greatest risk factor for developing GCA is aging. The disease almost never occurs before age 50, and its incidence rises steadily thereafter, peaking between the ages of 70 to 79 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-giant-cell-temporal-arteritis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], with over 80 percent of patients older than 70 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-giant-cell-temporal-arteritis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. One study found the mean age at incidence of GCA to be 76.7 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-giant-cell-temporal-arteritis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>In addition to age, ethnicity is a major risk factor for GCA. The highest incidence figures are found in Scandinavian countries and among Americans of Scandinavian descent. The annual incidence of GCA in Olmsted County, Minnesota is 17 per 100,000 persons over the age of 50, similar to that in Scandinavian countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-giant-cell-temporal-arteritis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This similarity probably reflects shared genetic risk factors, as many of the inhabitants of Olmsted County during the period of study were descended from Scandinavians and northern Europeans. In Southern Europe and Mediterranean countries incidence rates are lower, with less than 10 per 100,000 persons over the age of 50 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-giant-cell-temporal-arteritis/abstract/5,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,7,8</a>]. GCA is unusual in Latinos, Asians, and Arabs, though formal data on these populations are scant. The disease is decidedly uncommon in African Americans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-giant-cell-temporal-arteritis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Autopsy studies suggest that these data may underestimate the subclinical extent of GCA. A study from Sweden found arteritis in 1.6 percent of 889 postmortem cases in which sections of the temporal artery and two transverse sections of the aorta were made [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-giant-cell-temporal-arteritis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>As with many systemic rheumatic diseases, females are affected more frequently than males, in a ratio of almost 3:1 in populations of Scandinavian descent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-giant-cell-temporal-arteritis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The ratio of women to men is lower in Mediterranean countries. Familial aggregation of GCA is not unusual [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-giant-cell-temporal-arteritis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-giant-cell-arteritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of giant cell arteritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Most studies have found that mortality rates in GCA are not increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-giant-cell-temporal-arteritis/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>], with the exception of the subset of patients with significant aortitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-giant-cell-temporal-arteritis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H327457610\" class=\"local\">'Large vessel GCA'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H517922934\"><span class=\"h1\">ASSOCIATION WITH POLYMYALGIA RHEUMATICA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) is characterized by aching and morning stiffness about the shoulder and hip girdles, in the neck, and in the torso. PMR is closely linked to giant cell arteritis (GCA), occurring in about 40 to 50 percent of patients with GCA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-giant-cell-temporal-arteritis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Conversely, GCA is found in about 15 percent of patients with PMR. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-polymyalgia-rheumatica\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of polymyalgia rheumatica&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The precise nature of the relationship between GCA and PMR is not completely understood. In some patients, symptoms and signs of the two conditions occur simultaneously, while in others they appear separately over time.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The onset of symptoms in giant cell arteritis (GCA) tends to be subacute, but abrupt presentations occur in some patients. Although many of the clinical manifestations of GCA are nonspecific, some characteristic findings strongly suggest the diagnosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F54634\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef54634 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Constitutional symptoms</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systemic symptoms associated with GCA are frequent and include fever, fatigue, and weight loss. Fevers occur in up to one-half of patients with GCA and are usually low-grade. However, in approximately 15 percent of patients, fevers exceed 39&ordm;C (102.2&ordm;F), often leading to misdiagnoses of infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-giant-cell-temporal-arteritis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. One study found that one in six fevers of unknown origin in older adults was due to GCA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-giant-cell-temporal-arteritis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Anorexia and weight loss are usually minor, but, like fever, may be significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-giant-cell-temporal-arteritis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>We estimate that in approximately 10 percent of patients with GCA, constitutional symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> laboratory evidence of inflammation dominate the clinical presentation and can be the only clues to the diagnosis (see <a href=\"#H35\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory findings'</a> below). Thus, in an older adult with fever or other constitutional symptoms not explained by an initial evaluation for infection or malignancy, a diagnosis of GCA warrants consideration.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Headache</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Also common in the presentation of GCA is headache, which occurs in more than two-thirds of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-giant-cell-temporal-arteritis/abstract/15,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,19</a>]. The quality of headache in GCA, apart from the occasional specific complaint of tenderness of the scalp to touch, has no defining characteristics. Its critical feature is that it is new. Although headache is the chief complaint in many patients presenting with GCA, in some this symptom must be elicited by direct questioning.</p><p>Classically, headaches due to GCA are located over the temples, but they can also be frontal or occipital or generalized. The headaches can progressively worsen, or wax and wane, sometimes subsiding temporarily before treatment is started.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Jaw claudication</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nearly one-half of GCA patients experience jaw claudication. In some cases, a trismus-like symptom occurs rather than fatigue of the muscles of mastication. Two striking features of jaw claudication are its rapid onset after the start of chewing and the ensuing severity of pain. Patients seldom recognize the significance of symptoms of jaw claudication and must be questioned directly about this symptom. Claudication-like symptoms occasionally occur with repeated swallowing and in the tongue during eating.</p><p>In an analysis of the diagnostic value of temporal artery biopsies, which correlated positive biopsies with clinical symptoms, jaw claudication was the symptom most highly associated with a positive biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-giant-cell-temporal-arteritis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Among 134 patients who underwent temporal artery biopsy, jaw claudication was present in 54 percent of those with positive biopsies, compared with only 3 percent of those whose biopsies were negative.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H214773186\"><span class=\"h2\">Transient visual loss (amaurosis fugax)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transient monocular (and, rarely, binocular) impairment of vision can be an early manifestation of GCA. With transient monocular visual loss (TMVL), affected patients typically note an abrupt partial field defect or temporary curtain effect in the field of vision of one eye. Patients with polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) or GCA are often sensitized to the potential for vision loss, and it can be useful in the course of evaluating the possible significance of a reported visual disturbance to inquire if the patient tried to cover each eye; explicit monocular visual loss would heighten concern for GCA. Transient visual loss can be a harbinger of permanent visual loss, and thus mandates urgent attention in a patient with suspected PMR or GCA. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amaurosis-fugax-transient-monocular-or-binocular-visual-loss#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Amaurosis fugax (transient monocular or binocular visual loss)&quot;, section on 'Other causes of ischemia'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H517923029\"><span class=\"h2\">Permanent vision loss</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Unquestionably the most feared complication of GCA remains that of permanent loss of vision, which commonly is painless and sudden, may be partial or complete, and may be unilateral or bilateral. Even in the era of effective therapy, permanent partial or complete loss of vision in one or both eyes is reported in 15 to 20 percent of patients with GCA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-giant-cell-temporal-arteritis/abstract/21-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-26</a>]. Though permanent visual loss may be preceded by single or multiple episodes of transient visual loss, it can also occur with devastating swiftness. Once established, visual loss is rarely reversible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-giant-cell-temporal-arteritis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Moreover, it is estimated that within one week, further loss of vision in the <em>unaffected</em> eye ensues in 25 to 50 percent of untreated patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-giant-cell-temporal-arteritis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. However, if vision is intact shortly after treatment with an adequate dose of glucocorticoids is initiated, the risk of visual loss is virtually abolished. If there is preexisting visual loss, such treatment will markedly reduce the risk of further deterioration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-giant-cell-arteritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of giant cell arteritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H214773080\"><span class=\"h3\">Risk factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A defined means of stratifying risk for permanent visual loss in GCA, which would obviously be of great value for the clinician, has not been established. Age, hypertension, thrombocytosis, and other factors have been variously proposed as risk factors, but most studies identify a history of prior transient visual loss as the strongest predictor for subsequent permanent visual loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-giant-cell-temporal-arteritis/abstract/23-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-26</a>].</p><p>A reduced risk of cranial ischemic events, particularly visual loss, has been associated with the presence of certain symptoms <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> laboratory abnormalities suggestive of a heightened inflammatory status (fever, weight loss, erythrocyte sedimentation rate [ESR] greater than 85 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/hour,</span> and a hemoglobin concentration less than 11 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-giant-cell-temporal-arteritis/abstract/25,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,29</a>]. Although the possibility of a relationship between a low inflammatory state and an increased risk of cranial ischemic events is intriguing, it is of little use in the management of the individual patient, as there is another possible explanation for these findings: indicators of an enhanced systemic inflammatory response may lead to earlier diagnosis and the institution of timely treatment, thus preventing ischemic complications.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H368146369\"><span class=\"h3\">Causes of vision loss</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Permanent loss of vision in GCA results from arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION), central or branch retinal arterial occlusion <span class=\"nowrap\">(CRAO/BRAO),</span> posterior ischemic optic neuropathy (PION), or, rarely, cerebral ischemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-giant-cell-temporal-arteritis/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy</strong> &ndash; At least 80 percent of cases of vision loss in patients with GCA are caused by AION [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-giant-cell-temporal-arteritis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. The ischemic insult in arteritic AION is typically the consequence of occlusion of the posterior ciliary artery, a branch of the ophthalmic artery from the internal carotid artery, and the main arterial supply to the optic nerve.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Only about five percent of the total occurrences of AION are due to GCA, the majority being nonarteritic and secondary to atherosclerotic disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-giant-cell-temporal-arteritis/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. About 40 percent of patients who suffer nonarteritic AION regain some amount of visual acuity, in contrast to visual loss due to GCA, which is more often massive and irreversible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-giant-cell-temporal-arteritis/abstract/26,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,33</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Central retinal artery occlusion</strong> &ndash; CRAO is responsible for approximately 10 percent of the cases of visual loss in GCA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-giant-cell-temporal-arteritis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. On the other hand, approximately two percent of older patients with CRAO have underlying GCA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-giant-cell-temporal-arteritis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

Computed tomographic (CT) angiography of 40 patients with newly diagnosed, biopsy-proven GCA found evidence of arteritis in two-thirds of patients, mainly affecting the aorta (65 percent), but also affecting the brachiocephalic trunk (47 percent), subclavian arteries (42 percent), and femoral arteries (30 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-giant-cell-temporal-arteritis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

A subsequent analysis of a large database in the United Kingdom confirmed the increased risk of aortic aneurysms in GCA patients, but found the relative risk of aortic aneurysms in GCA patients to be twofold that of controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-giant-cell-temporal-arteritis/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The time course between the diagnosis of the GCA and the discovery of aortic aneurysm varies, depending on whether systematic imaging is obtained, but clinical recognition of an aortic aneurysm is delayed in the majority of patients. In a descriptive study of 41 patients with GCA who developed thoracic aortic aneurysms, three patients developed aneurysms before GCA was diagnosed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-giant-cell-temporal-arteritis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. GCA and aneurysms were diagnosed simultaneously in five patients. In the remaining 33 patients, aneurysms were detected a median of seven years after the diagnosis of GCA. A subsequent study from the same institution, without systematic screening, found a median time between the diagnosis of GCA and the identification of aortic aneurysm of 10.9 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-giant-cell-temporal-arteritis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The thoracic aorta, especially the ascending aorta, is affected more often than the abdominal aorta. Often there is little or no evidence, as assessed clinically or by laboratory data, for systemic activity of GCA.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Histopathologic examination of specimens obtained from surgery or autopsy shows a range of findings, from fibrosis to varying degrees of active aortitis, including giant cells. These findings suggest two mechanisms of disease: chronic or late recrudescent aortitis causing elastin and collagen disruption, or mechanical stress on an aortic wall that had been weakened in the early active phase of the disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Aortic dissection </strong>&ndash; While subclinical or clinical aortitis is common in GCA, the major complications of such involvement, namely aortic dissection <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> rupture, occur in a lesser proportion of patients. In two retrospective studies from large referral centers, aortic dissection or rupture was identified in 1 and 6 percent of all patients with GCA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-giant-cell-temporal-arteritis/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Aortic dissection, which affects mainly the ascending thoracic aorta, can occur in the presence or absence of aneurysmal dilation as well as early or late in the course of disease. Although longevity in GCA is overall unaffected, epidemiologic data indicate that survival of the subset of patients with aortic aneurysm and dissection is decreased (standardized mortality ratio 2.63; 95% CI 1.78-to 3.73) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-giant-cell-temporal-arteritis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Whether the behavior of aneurysms in GCA resembles or differs from aneurysms of other etiologies is uncertain. Unfortunately for the clinician, predictive factors for the development of aortic aneurysms and for the occasion of dissections <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ruptures in GCA have not been clearly delineated. The relatively small numbers of patients and inconsistencies in data collection make it difficult to assign with confidence prognostic roles for age, gender, duration and intensity of glucocorticoid therapy, size and rate of growth of aneurysm, and such traditional risk factors as smoking, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Idiopathic aortitis </strong>&ndash; Aortitis of unknown cause can affect the ascending aorta with a histopathology similar to that of GCA and Takayasu arteritis, but without the characteristic clinical stigmata of these diseases. The discovery of aortitis is nearly always unexpected, and comes to attention on histopathologic inspection of a surgically resected aneurysm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F101606%7ERHEUM%2F101607\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef101606 graphicRef101607 \">image 4A-B</a>). Aortitis can also occur as a complication of a variety of infections, sarcoidosis, Cogan&rsquo;s syndrome, and other systemic rheumatic diseases, including Takayasu arteritis, relapsing polychondritis, spondyloarthropathy, and Beh&ccedil;et&rsquo;s syndrome. A lymphoplasmacytic aortitis has also been reported in IgG4 disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-giant-cell-temporal-arteritis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].

Of the aortitis patients in the Danish study, a history of &ldquo;connective tissue disease&rdquo; was found in 27 percent of patients, and was specifically linked to temporal arteritis in 8 percent of patients. A retrospective study of aortitis found at surgery identified a &ldquo;rheumatologic history&rdquo; in a similar proportion (20 percent) of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-giant-cell-temporal-arteritis/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Aortitis is thus an uncommon cause of aneurysms of the thoracic aorta, and in such cases is often idiopathic.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Though idiopathic aortitis is commonly restricted to the ascending thoracic aorta, imaging studies can demonstrate involvement elsewhere in the arterial tree. One retrospective study found additional abnormalities on follow-up vascular imaging in 7 of 15 patients with idiopathic aortitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-giant-cell-temporal-arteritis/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Whether idiopathic aortitis lies within the spectrum of GCA or Takayasu arteritis, or whether it is a separate entity, remains to be clarified.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other large artery involvement</strong> &ndash; GCA can affect the subclavian arteries distal to the take-off of the vertebral arteries, and extend through the axillary arteries to the proximal brachial arteries. Arterial bruits, diminished or absent blood pressures, and arm claudication may ensue. Cold intolerance is common, but explicit digital ulcerations and gangrene are rare because of the adequacy of collateral arterial supply. In a retrospective population-based study, incident cases of subclavian stenosis were found in 4 percent of 168 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-giant-cell-temporal-arteritis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Upper-extremity disease in GCA characteristically is bilateral, though not symmetric, as well as circumferential. By contrast, atherosclerosis is more often unilateral, with eccentric involvement of the vessel wall. Gradual tapering of vessels, with occasional occlusion, is typical of the LV-GCA (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F73553\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef73553 \">image 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-giant-cell-temporal-arteritis/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].

The disease almost never occurs before age 50, and its incidence rises steadily thereafter. Although systemic manifestations are characteristic of GCA and although vascular involvement can be widespread, clinical manifestations of the disease most frequently result from involvement of the cranial branches of arteries originating from the aortic arch. The most sinister complication of GCA, visual loss, is one potential result of the major phenotype of the disease, that of cranial arteritis. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The onset of symptoms in GCA tends to be subacute, but abrupt presentations occur in some patients. When taking the patient&rsquo;s history, the clinician must ask about the following types of symptoms: systemic symptoms, such as fever, fatigue, and weight loss; headache; jaw claudication, which is the symptom most highly predictive of a positive temporal artery for the diagnosis of GCA; visual symptoms, particularly transient monocular visual loss (TMVL, amaurosis fugax) and diplopia; and symptoms of polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR). Other symptoms may also be present. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above and <a href=\"#H517922934\" class=\"local\">'Association with polymyalgia rheumatica'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A variety of ocular syndromes are associated with GCA. The most common are TMVL and anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION). It is estimated that bilateral blindness will develop in 25 to 50 percent of untreated patients who present with loss of vision in one eye. (See <a href=\"#H517923029\" class=\"local\">'Permanent vision loss'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subclinical involvement of the aorta and large arteries is frequent, a clinical consequence of which can be aortic aneurysm. (See <a href=\"#H327457610\" class=\"local\">'Large vessel GCA'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with GCA can appear unwell. In addition, specific findings related to involvement of characteristic arteries may be present, including the temporal artery, aorta and large arteries, and the vessels of the eye. The temporal arteries can be abnormal to palpation. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Physical examination findings'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Laboratory findings useful in the assessment of GCA include routine hematological testing, selected serum chemistry tests, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and C-reactive protein (CRP). (See <a href=\"#H35\" class=\"local\">'Laboratory findings'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-of-giant-cell-temporal-arteritis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Gonz&aacute;lez-Gay MA, Garc&iacute;a-Porr&uacute;a C.
