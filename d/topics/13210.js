As an example, in a retrospective review of registry data on 1558 children with inpatient arrest and a documented non-shockable initial rhythm, the median time to the first dose of epinephrine was one minute [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-advanced-life-support-pals/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].

A decline in EtCO<sub>2 </sub>during resuscitation may indicate inadequate effectiveness of compressions, dislodgement of an endotracheal tube, or disruption of pulmonary blood flow (eg, massive pulmonary embolus). Whether EtCO<sub>2</sub> has similar ability to identify the quality of CPR during pediatric resuscitations and specific values to guide therapy have not been established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-advanced-life-support-pals/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].

Thus, in addition to monitoring rate and clinical effectiveness of ventilation, we use EtCO<sub>2</sub> measurements from continuous waveform capnography whenever possible during pediatric cardiac arrest. Sudden, sustained increases in EtCO<sub>2 </sub>during CPR are associated with a return of spontaneous circulation (ROSC).

During CPR, a reasonable goal is to maintain the arterial relaxation (or &quot;diastole&quot;) pressure above 20 mmHg. Similarly, in adult patients, central venous oxygen saturation (SCVO<sub>2</sub>) provides information about oxygen delivery and cardiac output. During CPR, a reasonable goal is to maintain SCVO<sub>2</sub> above 30 percent (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=advanced-cardiac-life-support-acls-in-adults#H3328761\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Advanced cardiac life support (ACLS) in adults&quot;, section on 'Monitoring'</a>). Data from other physiologic monitors are less likely to be available in children with pulseless arrest, but measurements obtained from arterial and central venous catheters can provide useful feedback about the quality of CPR and the presence of ROSC. However, specific targets for blood pressure or SCVO<sub>2 </sub>have <strong>not</strong> been established in children during cardiac arrest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-advanced-life-support-pals/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9466635\"><span class=\"h3\">Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) with CPR</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation with CPR (ECPR) for infants and children with inpatient hospital cardiac arrests is used in approximately 1 percent of arrests and has <strong>not</strong> been associated with overall benefit when compared with conventional CPR in most studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-advanced-life-support-pals/abstract/1,2,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,11</a>].

Our approach is to prepare for possible ECPR after approximately 10 minutes of failed conventional resuscitation in patients with conditions that may be reversible after a period of ECPR (eg, myocarditis, pulmonary or air embolus, sudden arrest after cardiac surgery, poisoning, or primary hypothermic arrest) or who are candidates for the use of ECPR as a bridge to therapies such as cardiac transplantation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9466853\"><span class=\"h3\">Termination of resuscitation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although certain factors are associated with better or worse outcomes after cardiac arrest in infants and children, no single factor is reliable enough to accurately guide whether termination efforts should cease or continue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-advanced-life-support-pals/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Thus, the decision to terminate resuscitation should be individualized and multiple factors considered including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Duration of cardiac arrest, including when the patient was discovered relative to initial presentation (eg, patients with sudden Infant Death Syndrome who are found with evidence of lividity would have CPR discontinued earlier than patients with in hospital arrests)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Presenting rhythm (eg, shockable versus asystole or pulseless electrical activity)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Underlying disease or cause, if known (eg, cardiac disease, trauma, respiratory failure, or sepsis)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Setting and available resources</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not resuscitate status</p><p/><p>Intact survival after prolonged resuscitation (&gt;30 minutes) has occurred in patients with the following conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-advanced-life-support-pals/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Poisoning</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Primary hypothermic arrest (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypothermia-in-children-management#H21\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hypothermia in children: Management&quot;, section on 'Nonperfusing cardiac rhythms'</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with cardiac disease resuscitated with ECPR (see <a href=\"#H9466635\" class=\"local\">'Extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) with CPR'</a> above)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H35\"><span class=\"h2\">Early postresuscitation management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The early postresuscitation period involves the time soon after return of spontaneous circulation or recovery from circulatory or respiratory failure.

For this reason, infants and children who remain comatose after cardiac arrest should have electroencephalogram (EEG) evaluation for the presence of seizures, with prompt management to reduce the risk of worsening neurologic injury.</p><p>The management of nonconvulsive and convulsive status epilepticus are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonconvulsive-status-epilepticus#H22466618\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nonconvulsive status epilepticus&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-convulsive-status-epilepticus-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of convulsive status epilepticus in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Information from post-arrest EEG monitoring should <strong>not</strong> be used as the sole criterion for prognostication following pediatric cardiac arrest.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H289869232\"><span class=\"h3\">Targeted temperature management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Targeted temperature management describes measures to keep core body temperature in a pre-defined range after resuscitation. In our institution, we use a target core body temperature of 36 to 37.5&deg;C with the goal of avoiding fever (temperature &gt;38&deg;C) in children following cardiac arrest. Based upon the available evidence and international resuscitation guidelines, it is reasonable to <strong>either</strong> provide five days of normothermia (temperature 36 to 37.5&deg;C), or to provide two days of therapeutic hypothermia followed by three days of continuous normothermia for comatose infants and children after an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-advanced-life-support-pals/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Regardless of the approach chosen, fever (T &gt;38&deg;C) should be strictly avoided.</p><p>Elevated temperature following resuscitation is associated with worse outcomes in neonates and adult patients and is presumed to be harmful in children as well although there is no direct evidence in this population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-advanced-life-support-pals/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Fever is common in children after resuscitation from cardiac arrest; thus, defining the target range for temperature and careful core temperature monitoring are indicated. Prompt availability and anticipatory use of cooling blankets and anti-pyretics are routine in our practice.</p><p>Therapeutic hypothermia to maintain core body temperature below normal (typically 32 to 34&deg;C) has been evaluated in children based upon evidence for improved neurologic outcome in neonates and selected adults. For children resuscitated from out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, therapeutic hypothermia has <strong>not</strong> shown improved outcomes as follows (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-neonatal-encephalopathy#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of neonatal encephalopathy&quot;, section on 'Therapeutic hypothermia'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=post-cardiac-arrest-management-in-adults#H9724176\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Post-cardiac arrest management in adults&quot;, section on 'Targeted temperature management (TTM) and therapeutic hypothermia (TH)'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a multicenter trial involving children who were resuscitated from an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, 260 patients (48 hours to 18 years of age) were randomized to either therapeutic hypothermia with a target core body temperature of 33&deg;C or therapeutic normothermia to maintain a target temperature of 36.8&deg;C. One year survival with good neurologic function was <strong>not</strong> significantly different in patients undergoing therapeutic hypothermia compared with therapeutic normothermia (20 versus 12 percent, respectively, relative likelihood 1.54, 95% CI 0.86-2.76) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-advanced-life-support-pals/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. The groups also did not significantly differ with respect to incidence of adverse effects including infections or serious arrhythmias and 28-day mortality. Similarly, these investigators, using the same methodology, found no benefit of therapeutic hypothermia compared with therapeutic normothermia in 329 children resuscitated from in-hospital cardiac arrest [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-advanced-life-support-pals/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. This trial was stopped early for futility. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Of note, the number of patients randomized in both trials was insufficient to exclude an important benefit or harm from therapeutic hypothermia and further study may be warranted. The lack of benefit from hypothermia may be related to improved outcomes in the control groups of these two trials, both of whom received active controlled normothermia which may also be beneficial in patients with cardiac arrest. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several observational studies have shown no benefit for therapeutic hypothermia after out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-advanced-life-support-pals/abstract/28,30-32\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,30-32</a>] while one small retrospective series showed improved survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-advanced-life-support-pals/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p/><p>Taken together, available evidence suggests that temperature management in children after cardiac arrest should include measures to avoid fever and maintain core body temperature at or near normal. Further studies, are needed to establish the optimal temperature target and duration of targeted temperature management. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H289870391\"><span class=\"h3\">Transfer to a pediatric center</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the child is not being treated in a center with pediatric emergency and critical care expertise, the child should be stabilized and rapidly transferred for definitive care at a regional pediatric center. Critically ill or injured children typically benefit from transport by a team with pediatric expertise and advanced pediatric treatment capability, although in some isolated cases (eg, expanding epidural hematoma) more rapid transport by an immediately available non-pediatric team may be advantageous.

All documentation of care (eg, medical chart, medication administration record, laboratory results, copies of ancillary studies [radiographs, ECGs]) should be sent with the patient.

Implementation of a RRT has been promoted as a major strategy for improving patient safety in hospitals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-advanced-life-support-pals/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Infants and children with high-risk conditions who are managed on general inpatient units may benefit from rapid response teams that can provide prompt assessment and management if clinical deterioration occurs although results from large studies are not consistent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-advanced-life-support-pals/abstract/1,2,35-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,35-38</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A meta-analysis of five pediatric prospective observational studies with a total of 347,618 patient admissions found that implementation of a RRT was associated with a significant reduction in deaths from cardiac arrest when compared to historical control periods (0.05 versus 0.17 percent, relative risk [RR] 0.6, 95% CI 0.5-0.8) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-advanced-life-support-pals/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. However, decreased mortality after implementation of a RRT was not found in all studies.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A cohort study of 29,294 patient admissions (7257 admissions after institution of a RRT) that was included in the meta-analysis compared hospital-wide mortality rates and rates of respiratory and cardiopulmonary arrests outside of the intensive care unit before and after implementation of an RRT in a 264-bed freestanding children's hospital [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-advanced-life-support-pals/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. Major findings included:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The mean monthly mortality rate decreased from 1.0 to 0.8 deaths per 100 discharges (18 percent decrease, 95% CI 5-30 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The mean monthly code rate (respiratory or cardiopulmonary arrest) decreased from 2.5 to 0.7 codes per 1000 patient admissions (RR 0.3, 95% CI 0.1-0.7). A possible explanation for this finding is that early activation of the RRT in a critically ill patient might have prevented codes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Over 18 months, the RRT was activated 143 times, most commonly for respiratory distress, hypotension, hypoxemia, altered mental status, and tachycardia. The most common actions by the RRT were respiratory support, fluid resuscitation, airway management, and transfer to the intensive care unit.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A multicenter, prospective observational study of the implementation of a clinician-led pediatric RRT in four pediatric academic centers found that initiation of an RRT was associated with a significant reduction in pediatric intensive care unit mortality rate after readmission from a medical or surgical unit (0.3 to 0.1 deaths per 1000 hospital admissions) but no significant decline in the rate of cardiopulmonary arrests [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-advanced-life-support-pals/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. </p><p/><p>However, these observations do not prove that the RRT was responsible for the improvement in outcomes. Support for this concern comes from an observational study in a children's hospital that did <strong>not</strong> implement an RRT but also found a significant reduction in mortality over the same time period in which other pediatric centers reported decreased mortality in association with RRT implementation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-advanced-life-support-pals/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In a separate multicenter study that evaluated predicted versus actual hospital mortality rates in 38 free-standing children&rsquo;s hospital before and after implementation of a rapid response team and that controlled for declining mortality over time, rapid response team implementation was not associated with a reduction in hospital deaths beyond what was predicted by preimplementation trends [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-advanced-life-support-pals/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. </p><p>Thus, the benefit of an RRT is not consistent across all settings, and it is possible that explanations other than the RRT may be responsible for at least part of the benefit. In addition, the quality and generalizability of the evidence describing the effectiveness of implementing RRTs is limited by features such as before and after observation design, selection of primary and secondary outcome measures, and varied indications for RRT activation. In addition, because the mortality following pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) admission is typically low, its utility as an outcome measure may be limited. Finally, the systems being studied are complex, making it difficult to identify confounding factors such as changes in secular trends or indirect benefits derived from the RRT implementation. However, institutions may choose to implement and maintain RRTs based upon their own safety priorities.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1302295\"><span class=\"h2\">Family presence during resuscitation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Observational studies indicate that caretakers should be given the option of being present during the in-hospital resuscitation of their child [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-advanced-life-support-pals/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Key findings include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most parents want the opportunity to remain with their child during resuscitation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-advanced-life-support-pals/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>] and believe it is their right [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-advanced-life-support-pals/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Caretakers present during the resuscitation of a family member frequently reported that their presence during the resuscitation was beneficial to the patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-advanced-life-support-pals/abstract/40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-42</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two-thirds of caretakers present during the resuscitation of a child who died reported that their presence helped with their adjustment to the death and the grieving process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-advanced-life-support-pals/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Studies of hospital personnel suggest that the presence of a family member, in most instances, was not stressful to staff and did not negatively impact staff performance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pediatric-advanced-life-support-pals/abstract/40,41,43\" class=\"abstract_t\">40,41,43</a>].</p><p/><p>When family members are present during a pediatric resuscitation, a staff member with clinical knowledge, empathy, and strong interpersonal skills should be present with them to provide support and answer questions.</p><p>In the rare instance that family presence is disruptive to team resuscitation efforts, the family members should be respectfully asked to leave.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3096113235\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
