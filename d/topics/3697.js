The presenting symptoms are similar to those of menopause. The condition was previously referred to as &quot;premature menopause&quot; and &quot;premature ovarian failure.&quot; The age-specific incidence of spontaneous POI is approximately 1 in 250 by age 35 years and 1 in 100 by age 40 years.</p><p>Autoimmune POI due to autoimmune oophoritis is one of the rare causes of POI.</p><p>This topic review will discuss the pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnosis, and management of autoimmune POI.

There is strong histologic evidence that POI, when it occurs in association with adrenal autoimmunity, is autoimmune-mediated ovarian insufficiency. However, there is only circumstantial evidence to suggest that autoimmune POI occurs in the absence of steroid cell autoimmunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-autoimmune-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Autoimmune oophoritis may occur as part of type I and type II syndromes of polyglandular autoimmune failure, which are associated with autoantibodies to multiple endocrine and other organs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F67520\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef67520 \">table 1</a>).

It could be by exposure to a virus or other substance similar in structure to some component of ovarian tissue. Due to such &quot;molecular mimicry,&quot; activated lymphocytes or antibodies might react with ovarian tissue. It is also possible that a virus or other agent could damage ovarian tissue in such a way that it becomes antigenic. Alternatively, a basic failure in immune regulation might develop, leading to loss of specific tolerance to some ovarian component, and ultimately, ovarian autoimmunity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-autoimmune-primary-ovarian-insufficiency-premature-ovarian-failure/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].

However, because intermittent ovarian function occurs in approximately 50 to 75 percent of women with spontaneous POI, the absence of vasomotor symptoms or vaginal dryness should not dissuade one from considering the diagnosis of POI in a woman who presents with menstrual irregularity.

Symptoms that suggest the onset of primary adrenal insufficiency include anorexia, weight loss, vague abdominal pain, weakness, fatigue, salt craving, or increased skin pigmentation (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-adrenal-insufficiency-in-adults#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of adrenal insufficiency in adults&quot;, section on 'Chronic primary adrenal insufficiency'</a>). Approximately 3 percent of women with spontaneous POI develop adrenal insufficiency, a 300-fold increase compared with the general population.</p><p>A personal or family history of autoimmune diseases might suggest type I or type II syndromes of polyglandular autoimmune failure. Type I autoimmune failure most commonly occurs in children associated with adrenal insufficiency, hypoparathyroidism, and mucocutaneous candidiasis. Type II autoimmune typically occurs with adrenal insufficiency, type I diabetes, and hypothyroidism or Graves' disease.

Those with positive antibodies should be carefully evaluated for the presence of adrenal insufficiency.
