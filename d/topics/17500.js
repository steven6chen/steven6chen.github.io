TIPS insertion involves creation of a low-resistance channel between the hepatic vein and the intrahepatic portion of the portal vein (usually the right branch) using angiographic techniques (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F72311\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72311 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F93243\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef93243 \">image 1</a>). The tract is kept patent by deployment of an expandable metal stent across it, thereby allowing blood to return to the systemic circulation. TIPS insertion has been used primarily for control of variceal bleeding, but is also effective for some patients with refractory ascites. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-indications-and-contraindications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts: Indications and contraindications&quot;</a>.)</p><p>However, TIPS insertion can be associated with a number of complications, some of which may be fatal. It is therefore essential for all who use this procedure to be cognizant of the clinical spectrum of TIPS-related complications and their management.</p><p>The direct procedure-related mortality ranges from 0 to 2 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-complications/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], and the 30-day mortality ranges from 7 to 45 percent, depending on the indication and the clinical condition of the patient prior to the TIPS insertion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-complications/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>There are three broad categories of complications associated with TIPS insertion:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Technical complications</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complications related to creation of the portosystemic shunt</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unique TIPS-related complications</p><p/><p>This topic will review the complications related to TIPS insertion. Indications for TIPS insertion, including its use in variceal hemorrhage, are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-indications-and-contraindications\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts: Indications and contraindications&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=role-of-transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-in-the-treatment-of-variceal-bleeding\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Role of transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunts in the treatment of variceal bleeding&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNICAL COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The technical complications associated with transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) insertion can occur at various stages of the procedure. A needle catheter (Colapinto catheter) is passed via a transjugular route into the hepatic vein and wedged there. The needle is then extruded and advanced through the liver parenchyma to the intrahepatic portion of the portal vein (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F72311\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72311 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications related to access to the hepatic vein</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The potential for complications begins from the time procedural sedation is given to the patient. Beside inadvertent carotid artery or tracheal puncture, the most important complication during this part of the procedure is the development of cardiac arrhythmias as the catheter is passed through the heart. This is most likely to occur if the catheter buckles within the right atrium and rubs against its wall or prolapses into the right ventricle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-complications/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Although atrial premature beats have little clinical significance, more serious arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation, conduction defects (nodal or infranodal), and ventricular tachycardia, can occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-complications/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Furthermore, in patients with a preexisting left bundle branch block, it is possible that a procedure-related transient right bundle branch block could result in a potentially fatal complete heart block.</p><p>The likelihood of such arrhythmias may be minimized by correction of electrolyte and acid-base abnormalities prior to the procedure and also by using a Check Flow II (Ring Transjugular Intrahepatic Access set) introducer. This introducer is a relatively stiff 40-cm sheath which prevents buckling of the catheter in the right heart.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications related to creation of the intrahepatic tract</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The principal risk associated with creation of the intrahepatic tract is traversal of the liver capsule during attempts to enter the portal vein. The reported incidence of capsule traversal is approximately 33 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-complications/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]; however, the development of clinically obvious hemoperitoneum is relatively rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-complications/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This complication is most likely to occur in two settings: when the liver is small, hard, and displaced upward by tense ascites, thereby making the angle necessary to enter the portal vein from the hepatic vein very acute; and when the portal vein is thrombosed and replaced by collaterals. When the capsule is traversed, anecdotal reports of prevention of bleeding by embolization of the tract with a pledget of gel foam have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-complications/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>TIPS insertion may be facilitated by a large volume paracentesis and careful evaluation of portal vein patency by Doppler sonography prior to the procedure. In addition, if the portal vein is not entered easily, a more complete diagnostic evaluation of portal vein patency by mesenteric angiography should be performed instead of persisting with blind attempts to enter the portal vein.</p><p>Another important complication during this part of the procedure is the creation of a tract between the shunt or the portal vein and the hepatic artery or bile ducts. The clinical consequences depend upon the specific structures involved. As an example, the inadvertent creation of a TIPS-biliary fistula can cause hemobilia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-complications/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Fistulae between both large and microscopic bile ducts and the TIPS lumen have been associated with the development of shunt thrombosis and early stent occlusion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F77747\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef77747 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-complications/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Complications of portal vein manipulation and stent placement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A rare but often fatal complication of TIPS insertion is extrahepatic puncture of the portal vein with exsanguinating hemorrhage after attempts to dilate the site of portal vein puncture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-complications/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The risk of this complication can be minimized by avoiding the main portal vein and only using its main branches for stent placement. There are anecdotal reports of successful management by quickly placing a Wallstent across the site of puncture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-complications/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Extensive thrombosis of the TIPS, portal vein, or splenic vein occurs in 3 to 12 percent of patients after TIPS insertion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-complications/abstract/1,5,8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,5,8-10</a>]. No data exist to clearly implicate preoperative platelet counts, prothrombin time, or procedure time as risk factors for the development of thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-complications/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In addition, there are no data on using thromboelastography to determine the risk of thrombosis after TIPS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-portal-vein-thrombosis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute portal vein thrombosis in adults: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=platelet-function-testing#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Platelet function testing&quot;, section on 'Thromboelastography (TEG)'</a>.)</p><p>With the introduction of covered stents, TIPS patency has been vastly improved, and as a result, anticoagulation is not routinely required after TIPS insertion to maintain shunt patency.</p><p>When thrombosis does occur, it is accurately detected by Doppler sonography within the first month after TIPS. Treatment options include thrombolysis, anticoagulation, or suction thrombectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-complications/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In those who are transplant candidates, liver transplantation is the optimal definitive treatment. We have used both suction thrombectomy followed by urgent liver transplant and thrombolysis followed by long-term anticoagulation in this setting. The choice of a specific method depends upon the expertise available and the individual clinical circumstances.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS RELATED TO PORTOSYSTEMIC SHUNTING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary complication due to shunting of blood from the portal to systemic circulation is the development of portosystemic encephalopathy (PSE). In addition, transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) placement has also been associated with acute pulmonary edema and heart failure.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H141506775\"><span class=\"h2\">Portosystemic encephalopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of PSE following TIPS is approximately 30 to 55 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-complications/abstract/12-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-16</a>] with up to 10 percent of patients requiring shunt revision for PSE alone. This is similar to that reported after surgical portal diversion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-complications/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. In one study, for example, 9 of 30 patients receiving TIPS had 24 episodes of PSE during follow-up; in comparison, only six episodes of PSE occurred in 25 concurrent controls treated only with sclerotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-complications/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Older age, advanced liver failure, minimal hepatic encephalopathy at the time of TIPS placement, and a history of overt hepatic encephalopathy prior to TIPS placement have all been associated with an increased risk of developing PSE after TIPS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-complications/abstract/12,14,16,19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,14,16,19,20</a>].</p><p>In studies of patients with polytetrafluorethylene (PTFE)-covered stents, the risk of PSE after TIPS ranged from approximately 25 to 45 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-complications/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. Additional risk factors including hyponatremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-complications/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>] and sarcopenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-complications/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>] were identified in these studies.</p><p>The diameter of the shunt may influence the development of PSE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-complications/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. According to Poiseuille's equation, resistance to flow can be defined as:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160;Resistance = 8nl &divide; &pi;r(4)</p></div></div><p>Where r is the radius of the stent, n is the coefficient of viscosity, and l is the length of the vessel.</p><p>Thus, the resistance to flow through the shunt decreases exponentially with increasing shunt diameter, resulting in increases in shunt flow and portosystemic shunting. The probability of PSE increases dramatically at shunt diameters above 10 mm. However, one randomized trial that assigned 45 patients to receive either 8 or 10 mm diameter stents failed to show an increased incidence of PSE in the patients with larger diameter shunts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-complications/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. At one year, the probability of being free of PSE was 43 percent in the 8 mm stent arm and 47 percent in the 10 mm stent arm. In addition, the trial was stopped prior to enrolling its goal of 114 patients because of a significantly higher portosystemic pressure gradient in patients who received the smaller shunts (8.9 versus 6.5 mmHg). This correlated with a decrease in the probability of remaining free from complications due to portal hypertension at one year in the 8 mm group compared with the 10 mm group (42 versus 83 percent).</p><p>PSE usually becomes clinically apparent two to three weeks after TIPS insertion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-complications/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. The occurrence of PSE six weeks or more after TIPS insertion is typically precipitated by gastrointestinal bleeding. Pharmacologic prophylaxis with lactitol or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifaximin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifaximin</a> during the first month after TIPS was not beneficial in a controlled trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-complications/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Society guidelines do not recommend prophylactic therapy (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=lactulose-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lactulose</a> or rifaximin) for the prevention of post-TIPS hepatic encephalopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-complications/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>The symptoms of PSE typically include altered sleep pattern, confusion, disorientation, and hepatic coma. The serum ammonia levels are invariably elevated although the precise levels do not correlate well with the degree of mental status changes. Encephalopathy may be precipitated by constipation, dehydration, infections, dietary indiscretion, or electrolyte abnormalities (such as hypokalemia and metabolic alkalosis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-complications/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatic-encephalopathy-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatic encephalopathy in adults: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Theoretically, patients undergoing TIPS insertion should also be susceptible to development of focal neurologic deficits compatible with hepatic myelopathy (also referred to as portosystemic or shunt myelopathy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-complications/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. Hepatic myelopathy is characterized by paresis of the extremities, muscle spasticity, and the presence of a Babinski sign (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-detailed-neurologic-examination-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The detailed neurologic examination in adults&quot;</a>). </p><p>However, hepatic myelopathy is rare, and this author has seen one patient who developed a classic case of hepatic myelopathy three years after TIPS placement. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disorders-affecting-the-spinal-cord#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disorders affecting the spinal cord&quot;, section on 'Hepatic myelopathy'</a>.)</p><p>In one series, an attempt was made to quantify the degree of encephalopathy after TIPS using a portosystemic encephalopathy index [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-complications/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The PSE index rose sharply within 7 to 10 days after TIPS placement (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F72160\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72160 \">figure 2</a>). Over time, the PSE index declined, but at six months, it remained significantly higher compared with baseline values and values in concurrent matched controls who underwent sclerotherapy. The decline in PSE index may be attributed to both treatment of the encephalopathy and the development of stent stenosis, due to pseudointimal hyperplasia, which reduced the degree of portosystemic shunting. Subsequent studies using cognitive tests have demonstrated declining performance on these tests following TIPS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-complications/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>], especially in selected patients (eg, those with sarcopenia or pre-TIPS cognitive impairment).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2209292962\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment of post-TIPS encephalopathy is similar to that of portosystemic encephalopathy in other settings. When PSE develops de novo or worsens after TIPS insertion, a search for precipitating factors is mandatory. Such factors include gastrointestinal bleeding, dehydration, electrolyte and acid-base disturbances, infections, inappropriate use of medications, and constipation. Precipitating factors should be treated, if possible. </p><p>In addition, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lactulose-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lactulose</a> may be administered and the dose titrated to achieve two to four semiformed bowel movements daily. Nutritional support should include maintaining an energy intake of 35 to 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">kcal/kg/day,</span> with a protein intake of 1.2 to 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/kg/day</span>. The approach to management of hepatic encephalopathy is discussed separately.

Compared with a control group of patients who did not develop this complication after TIPS insertion, those with severe hyperbilirubinemia had a markedly worse prognosis (95 versus 17 percent incidence of death or liver transplantation at 90 days).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infections involving TIPS include stent infection and periprocedural sepsis without stent infection, and they can be successfully treated with intravenous antibiotics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-complications/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. It is common practice that prophylactic antibiotics are administered to patients prior to TIPS insertion using an agent such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a> (1 g) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a><span class=\"nowrap\">/sulbactam</span> (1.5 to 3 g), or in patients allergic to penicillin, a combination of an aminoglycoside with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-complications/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].</p><p>We have described the occurrence of vegetative infections involving the TIPS in eight patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-complications/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. These infections occurred weeks to months after TIPS insertion and presented with intermittent or continuous fever; in some patients, multiple temperature spikes occurred daily with an erratic pattern. The diagnosis was established by the presence of continuous bacteremia (ie, multiple positive blood cultures from different sites), the presence of vegetation in the TIPS or complete occlusion of the stent by a thrombus, and the absence of an alternate focus of infection despite an extensive search. The organisms were predominantly of enteric origin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">TIPS stenosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TIPS insertion involves the disruption of hepatic parenchyma followed by creation of a high flow vascular tract. The hepatic response to the creation of this wound is the development of a pseudointima that grows in from the surrounding liver through the wire mesh of the stent to line the shunt [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-complications/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. This pseudointima is composed of an incomplete layer of lining endothelial cells with underlying collagenous matrix and mesenchymal cells interspersed between the collagen fibrils. </p><p>The incidence of TIPS stenosis has declined substantially since the introduction of covered stents, and we suggest that all TIPS procedures be performed with such stents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-complications/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>]. As an example, in one trial, 80 patients were randomly assigned to receive a covered stent or an uncovered stent and were followed for two years. Shunt patency in the covered stent group was 76 percent versus 36 percent in the uncovered stent group. Clinical relapse occurred in fewer patients in the covered stent group (10 versus 29 percent). The covered stent group had a higher rate of being free of hepatic encephalopathy (67 versus 51 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-complications/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Monitoring TIPS patency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>TIPS stenosis is a cause of recurrent portal hypertension and variceal hemorrhage after TIPS placement with an uncovered stent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-complications/abstract/5,48\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,48</a>]. Assessing the shunt for patency is recommended. We perform Doppler sonograms between three and six months after TIPS and repeat sonography at six-month intervals for the first two years. It is convenient to time the sonography to coincide with screening for hepatocellular cancer. </p><p>Angiography is the gold standard by which shunt patency is assessed and is also required for treatment of shunt stenosis. However, it is limited by its invasive nature and cost. Angiography is reserved for those with sonographic evidence of stenosis or clinical features of recurrent portal hypertension (eg, recurrent ascites or variceal bleeding). The low stenosis rates with covered stents have reduced the need for routine angiography.</p><p>Although Doppler sonography is used as a noninvasive method to monitor shunt patency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-complications/abstract/5,49-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,49-53</a>], the primary limitation of sonography is its relative insensitivity in detecting stent stenosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-complications/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. As an example, one study calculated the sensitivity and specificity of duplex ultrasonography compared with venography in 60 studies among 38 cirrhotic patients who had undergone TIPS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-complications/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Ultrasonography had a sensitivity of 35 percent and a specificity of 83 percent for detecting TIPS stenosis or occlusion. Improvements in technology, such as echo-enhanced Doppler ultrasonography, may result in a sensitivity more closely approaching that of angiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-complications/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].</p><p>Helical CT angiography also has shown promise. In one study, 37 patients underwent 50 examinations, which were compared with findings on portography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transjugular-intrahepatic-portosystemic-shunts-complications/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. Helical CT angiograms correctly demonstrated 30 of 31 morphologic abnormalities (97 percent) and permitted the correct diagnosis of 22 of 24 hemodynamically significant abnormalities (92 percent). CT angiograms correctly demonstrated normal findings in 90 percent of cases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H368192972\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
