There are several types of cardiomyopathy, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dilated cardiomyopathy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Restrictive cardiomyopathy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unclassified cardiomyopathies</p><p/><p>In the United States, dilated cardiomyopathy occurs in approximately five to eight people per 100,000; it causes approximately 10,000 deaths and 46,000 hospitalizations each year. It is the most common reason for heart transplantation.</p><p>This topic review discusses the definition, symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment of dilated cardiomyopathy. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hypertrophic-cardiomyopathy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">HEART FUNCTION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Normal heart function</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The heart is a pump that contains four chambers: the right atrium, right ventricle, left atrium, and left ventricle (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F58389\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58389 \">figure 1</a>). Blood returning to the heart from the body flows into the right atrium and then the right ventricle. Blood is pumped out of the right ventricle into the lungs, where oxygen is added. Blood then returns to the heart through the left atrium. Blood in the left atrium flows into the left ventricle, which pumps the blood out the aorta to deliver oxygen to the brain, muscles, and other organs and tissues.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Heart function in dilated cardiomyopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a disease of the heart muscle in which the heart chambers become enlarged or dilated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F58474\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58474 \">figure 2</a>). The heart muscle is weakened, making it more difficult for blood to flow from the body and lungs into the heart and for blood to be pumped from the heart to the rest of the body. The left ventricle is affected most commonly by DCM, although the right ventricle can also be affected. The dilatation often becomes severe and the heart may become quite enlarged. As the function of the left <span class=\"nowrap\">(and/or</span> right) ventricle worsens, signs and symptoms of heart failure may develop.</p><p>The term &quot;heart failure&quot; can be misleading because the heart does not completely fail or stop, but instead functions less effectively. Heart failure may range in severity from a mild condition that causes no symptoms, to one in which the heart muscle is significantly damaged, leaving the person with multiple debilitating symptoms, such as shortness of breath and fatigue at rest. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-failure-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Heart failure (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CAUSES OF DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) can be caused by a variety of disorders. In more than 50 percent of cases, however, no cause can be found, and the cardiomyopathy is called &quot;idiopathic.&quot;</p><p>Some causes of DCM are reversible and the condition improves once the cause is treated or eliminated or the condition subsides. Other causes of DCM produce irreversible damage. In these cases, treatment focuses on optimizing the function of the heart, preventing worsening of heart failure, reducing symptoms, and preventing complications (eg, irregular heartbeat, blood clots). (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Dilated cardiomyopathy treatment'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHY SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common symptoms of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shortness of breath (dyspnea) with exertion, which may progress to shortness of breath at rest</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shortness of breath when lying down (orthopnea)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sudden shortness of breath at night, often awakening the patient (paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impaired ability to be active or exercise</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Swelling of the lower legs, ankles, and feet (peripheral edema)</p><p/><p>Most people develop symptoms of DCM between the ages of 20 and 60, although it can occur at any age. Symptoms of heart failure typically do not occur until late in the disease. Symptoms may worsen gradually or abruptly appear or worsen.</p><p>Often, there are no early symptoms of DCM and the heart is discovered to be enlarged as a result of a test done for another reason (eg, a chest x-ray).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHY DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis and evaluation of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) focuses upon determining if there are treatable or reversible causes. This process is described in detail in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-failure-beyond-the-basics#H9\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Heart failure (Beyond the Basics)&quot;, section on 'Heart failure diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Testing of family members</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Between 30 and 50 percent of people with idiopathic DCM have inherited a genetic mutation for the disease. Some of these mutations can be identified with blood testing. People who have one or more family members who experienced sudden cardiac death or developed unexplained heart failure before age 60 should be evaluated by a genetics center that is experienced with cardiovascular diseases; a genetics counselor can help to determine if genetic testing would be helpful (see <a href=\"http://www.nsgc.org/&amp;token=FKllOXvQbnazcvqQIfxRXUDLUQpodCP1Rwhz3bInafs=&amp;TOPIC_ID=3436\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.nsgc.org</a>; click on &quot;Find a counselor&quot;).</p><p>If there is no family history of DCM, unexplained heart failure, or sudden cardiac death, first degree family members (eg, parents, siblings, children) of a person with DCM can consider screening tests, including an electrocardiogram and echocardiogram, to determine if there are early signs of DCM. However, there are a few caveats related to screening:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Screening tests cannot always predict which relatives will be affected by DCM or how severe the disease will be.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having a single normal screening test does not mean that cardiomyopathy will not develop in the future. Screening tests are usually repeated every three to five years, unless symptoms develop sooner.</p><p/><p>The initial symptoms of DCM are variable (shortness of breath, fainting, sudden death). In people with a family history of DCM, any new symptoms should be evaluated promptly.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">DILATED CARDIOMYOPATHY TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) depends upon the cause, the severity, and whether or not symptoms are present.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Treat the underlying cause</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the cause of DCM can be identified, the first step is to treat this cause. This may include avoiding exposure to toxins (eg, alcohol, cocaine) or treating endocrine disorders (eg, diabetes, thyroid disease).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment of idiopathic DCM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the cause of DCM is not known (ie, idiopathic DCM), no specific treatment is available. Instead, treatments will be recommended to optimize heart function, reduce the risk of worsening disease, prevent complications, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> reduce symptoms caused by heart failure.</p><p>Treatment of heart failure caused by DCM is the same as that for heart failure caused by other conditions. Treatment of heart failure is discussed in detail in a separate topic review.
