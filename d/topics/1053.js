Thus, all treatment for PVE should be initiated in the hospital, preferably in an institution where cardiac surgery is available. Patients should remain hospitalized until fever resolves and it is clear that surgery can be safely avoided (or, if patients have been operated on, that they are stable postoperatively).</p><p>It is essential to isolate the causative organism in patients with suspected PVE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-therapy-of-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. For patients who are hemodynamically stable with an indolent clinical course, antibiotic therapy should be delayed pending blood culture results. This delay allows additional blood cultures to be obtained without the confounding effect of antibiotics, which is particularly important for patients who have received recent antimicrobial agents and whose initial blood cultures may be negative.</p><p>Patients presenting with hemodynamic instability or acute disease should receive empiric antibiotics promptly after three sets of blood cultures have been obtained. While cultures to guide therapy are pending, empiric broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy should be initiated to cover both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria: <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a>, and either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefepime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cefepime</a> or a carbapenem with antipseudomonal activity (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=imipenem-and-cilastatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imipenem</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meropenem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">meropenem</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doripenem-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doripenem</a>). Subsequent therapy should be adjusted based on culture results; if cultures remain negative, therapy as outlined for culture-negative PVE should be administered. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Culture negative'</a> below.)</p><p>Antimicrobial treatment regimens for PVE are based upon clinical experience. In general, with some exceptions, the antimicrobial regimen used to treat a specific pathogen causing PVE is based on the treatment used for that organism when it causes native valve endocarditis (NVE). Duration of therapy, however, is usually longer than that used to treat NVE. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antimicrobial-therapy-of-native-valve-endocarditis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antimicrobial therapy of native valve endocarditis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>No randomized controlled studies have evaluated the optimal duration of therapy for PVE. We are in general agreement with treatment guidelines issued by the American Heart Association (AHA) and the European Society for Cardiology (ESC); these guidelines recommend that PVE should be treated with an agent(s) that is bactericidal for the isolated microorganism for at least six weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-therapy-of-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. There are some small differences between the AHA and the ESC; these are discussed below and summarized in the Tables. After initial stabilization in the hospital, the remainder of treatment may be administered in the setting of outpatient parenteral antibiotic therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">STAPHYLOCOCCI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment choices for staphylococcal prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) are not contingent on whether the pathogen is coagulase negative or <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em>, unlike most other types of staphylococcal infections (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F61202\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61202 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-therapy-of-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. The primary consideration in choosing therapy hinges upon whether the organism is sensitive to methicillin and other beta-lactam antibiotics. In addition, PVE caused by staphylococci may require surgical intervention. The indications and benefits of surgical intervention are more nuanced than previously recognized [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-therapy-of-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]; issues related to surgery for PVE are discussed further separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgery-for-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgery for prosthetic valve endocarditis&quot;, section on 'Microorganisms usually requiring surgery'</a>.)</p><p>Antimicrobial treatment of staphylococcal PVE requires combination therapy. We agree with the American Heart Association (AHA) and the European Society for Cardiology (ESC), which recommend a triple-drug regimen, as described below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-therapy-of-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p>Evidence to support a triple-drug regimen (with one drug being <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a>) comes from animal models of prosthetic device infection and retrospective clinical series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-therapy-of-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/3,8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8-11</a>]. A retrospective study of valve cultures from 61 patients with staphylococcal PVE treated surgically found that valves from patients receiving combination therapy were 5.9 times more likely to be culture negative than those receiving monotherapy when results were adjusted for duration of therapy before surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-therapy-of-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Although the numbers are too small to analyze, all six patients who received a triple-drug regimen that included rifampin had negative valve cultures at surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Methicillin susceptibility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A semisynthetic penicillinase-resistant penicillin (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=nafcillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nafcillin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxacillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxacillin</a>) is the mainstay of therapy for isolates susceptible to methicillin. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Vancomycin</a> is the primary drug for isolates resistant to methicillin. In patients with penicillin allergy that does not involve anaphylaxis, swelling, or hives, we are in agreement with the AHA, which recommends that a first-generation cephalosporin can substitute for nafcillin or oxacillin.</p><p>The second and third agents of the triple-drug regimen should be <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a> if the organism is susceptible to these agents. The aminoglycoside should be administered for the initial two weeks of treatment, after which it can be discontinued; the other two agents should be continued for at least four additional weeks. If the organism is resistant to gentamicin, an alternative aminoglycoside should be sought based upon antibiotic susceptibilities. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Rifampin'</a> below.)</p><p>If the isolate is resistant to all available aminoglycosides, a fluoroquinolone to which the strain is highly susceptible could be used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-therapy-of-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. If a fluoroquinolone is used in lieu of an aminoglycoside, we prefer to continue the three-drug regimen for the entire course of treatment. When the isolate is resistant to all aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=linezolid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">linezolid</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-therapy-of-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftaroline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftaroline</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-co-trimoxazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole</a> could be used as a third drug for the initial two weeks of therapy, contingent upon in vitro susceptibility.</p><p>If breakthrough bacteremia or microbiologic failure occurs in patients receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a>, the isolate recovered from the breakthrough bacteremia should be tested for both vancomycin and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=daptomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">daptomycin</a> resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-therapy-of-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>The optimal therapy is uncertain for PVE caused by methicillin-resistant <em>S. aureus</em> with reduced <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> susceptibility (minimum inhibitory concentration &gt;1.0) or PVE with failure to respond to vancomycin therapy. High-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=daptomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">daptomycin</a> (8 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> as a single daily dose, if the isolate is daptomycin susceptible), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=telavancin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">telavancin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftaroline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftaroline</a>, daptomycin combined with ceftaroline or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nafcillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nafcillin</a> (a combination that may result in synergy), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=linezolid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">linezolid</a> are often active against these organisms and may be useful for treatment, although clinical experience with these in the treatment of PVE is limited [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-therapy-of-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/17-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-21</a>]. In this situation, the ESC suggests that high-dose daptomycin in combination with a beta-lactam (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxacillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxacillin</a> or ceftaroline) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fosfomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fosfomycin</a> (not available for parenteral use in the United States) should be used in lieu of vancomycin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-therapy-of-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Rifampin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Rifampin</a> appears to have the unique ability to kill staphylococci that are adherent to foreign material, based upon in vitro data, evidence from animal model experiments, and clinical observations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-therapy-of-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/3,10-14,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,10-14,22</a>]. This drug is an essential component of regimens used to treat staphylococcal PVE. However, bacterial cells have a relatively high intrinsic mutation rate for the gene controlling the rifampin site of action. These mutations allow the rapid selection of a rifampin-resistant subpopulation when large numbers of staphylococci are exposed to rifampin alone or in combination with ineffective antimicrobials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-therapy-of-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/3,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,12</a>].</p><p>To protect against the emergence of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a> resistance, the recommended regimens for staphylococcal PVE (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Staphylococci'</a> above) ideally contain two additional antimicrobials, which should be identified prior to the initiation of rifampin, if at all possible. Thus, a regimen with two other drugs to which the staphylococci are susceptible should be in place at the time rifampin is begun. If the isolate is not sensitive to two additional antimicrobials, therapy with a single antistaphylococcal agent should be administered for three to five days before beginning rifampin. This strategy may reduce the total number of staphylococci at the site of infection and thus diminish the probability that a rifampin-resistant subpopulation will emerge. Nevertheless, susceptibility to rifampin should be reassessed when regimens containing rifampin fail [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-therapy-of-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">STREPTOCOCCI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most viridans group streptococci are highly penicillin susceptible, defined in the United States as a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) &le;0.12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span>. Occasional strains are relatively resistant to penicillin (MIC &gt;0.12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> and &lt;0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL),</span> and rare strains are fully resistant to penicillin (MIC &ge;0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-therapy-of-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines use these MIC parameters to guide the approach to treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-therapy-of-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]; the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (BSAC) guidelines and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines use different MIC parameters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-therapy-of-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/2,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,24</a>].</p><p>The preferred regimen for streptococcal prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) consists of combination therapy with a beta-lactam antibiotic and an aminoglycoside (if the isolate does not exhibit high-level aminoglycoside resistance). To provide maximal therapy, combination beta-lactam-aminoglycoside therapy is used to achieve synergistic killing of the organism; this synergistic interaction is similar to that seen with combination therapy for enterococcal endocarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-therapy-of-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>The addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a> to penicillin may be beneficial for treatment of PVE caused by penicillin-susceptible streptococci based on in vitro studies, in vivo studies using experimental endocarditis models, clinical series, and experience of experts (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F61640\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61640 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-therapy-of-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/4,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,26</a>]. However, there are no studies that demonstrate the superiority of this combination therapy over that provided by penicillin alone. High-level resistance to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=streptomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">streptomycin</a> in viridans streptococci and <em>S. gallolyticus (bovis)</em> abrogates the bactericidal synergism of the penicillin-streptomycin combination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-therapy-of-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>], and it is likely that high-level resistance to gentamicin would preclude a synergistic interaction of penicillin with gentamicin. Considering the potential toxicity of gentamicin, it seems clinically prudent to test the viridans <em>Streptococcus</em> or <em>S. gallolyticus </em>for the presence of high-level gentamicin resistance before initiating combination therapy. In the absence of high-level gentamicin resistance, gentamicin (given as a single daily dose) may be given during the initial two weeks of treatment. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Enterococci'</a> below.)</p><p>Studies have not been done evaluating for presence of high-level resistance to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a> in viridans streptococci and <em>S. gallolyticus</em>; high-level resistance to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=streptomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">streptomycin</a> has been identified in a small percentage of clinical isolates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-therapy-of-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. There is no Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)-approved methodology for screening these streptococci for high-level aminoglycoside resistance; the brain-heart infusion (BHI) agar plates commercially available for screening enterococci might be used. Growth of the isolate on BHI in the face of high concentrations of gentamicin or streptomycin would suggest high-level resistance that would likely preclude synergism with the respective aminoglycoside. In the absence of high-level streptomycin resistance, streptomycin may be given in lieu of gentamicin to achieve the same effect, but gentamicin is more commonly used in clinical practice due to the wider availability of laboratory testing for gentamicin serum levels and because dosing regimens for gentamicin are more familiar to most clinicians than dosing regimens for streptomycin. For these reasons, we favor gentamicin if the isolate does not exhibit high-level gentamicin resistance. Penicillin, a cephalosporin, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> can be used alone if aminoglycoside therapy is relatively contraindicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-therapy-of-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>If the <em>Streptococcus</em> is relatively resistant to penicillin, the AHA recommends that the aminoglycoside be continued for the entire duration of therapy, if not precluded by nephrotoxicity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F71412\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef71412 \">table 3</a>). Here too, for the reasons noted above, it is prudent to screen the streptococcus for high-level aminoglycoside resistance and not use an aminoglycoside to which the organism possesses high-level resistance. In such cases wherein combination therapy will not be synergistic, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> monotherapy might be preferable. Although there is a theoretical benefit to a longer course of aminoglycoside therapy when treating PVE caused by these relatively resistant strains, there are not sufficient data upon which to base recommendations on duration of therapy or dosing frequency. If the isolate has a penicillin MIC &gt;0.12 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL,</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a> should be administered in three divided doses for two weeks. If the isolate has a penicillin MIC is &ge;0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> or if PVE is caused by <em>Abiotrophia defectiva</em>, <em>Granulicatella </em>spp, or <em>Gemella </em>spp, gentamicin should be administered in three divided doses for six weeks. This guidance is based on limited data generated from native valve endocarditis treatment and the risk of enhanced aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity with longer courses of therapy. If the patient is intolerant of penicillin and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a>, vancomycin monotherapy can be used; concurrent gentamicin treatment is not advised because of the increased risk of nephrotoxicity when these vancomycin and gentamicin are administered concurrently.</p><p>Among patients who are allergic to penicillin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> is advised for those with immediate-type reactions (urticaria or anaphylaxis). <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cefotaxime-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Cefotaxime</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a> may be used in non&ndash;immediate type allergies.

High-level resistance to gentamicin and streptomycin are mediated by two independently acquired genes; hence, organisms should be tested for high-level resistance to each of these drugs.</p><p>Based on in vitro studies, animal models, and clinical series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-therapy-of-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>], we are in agreement with the American Heart Association (AHA) and the European Society for Cardiology (ESC) guidelines, which recommend combination therapy with a cell wall active agent (penicillin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a>) plus an aminoglycoside (usually <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=streptomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">streptomycin</a>) for treatment of prosthetic valve endocarditis (PVE) caused by enterococci (as long as the strain is confirmed to be susceptible) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-therapy-of-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. An alternative regimen consists of beta-lactam combination therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a> and ampicillin.</p><p>Cephalosporins used alone are not usually active against enterococci and hence do not interact with aminoglycosides to result in bactericidal synergy. The cephalosporins should not be used in lieu of penicillin or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a> as the cell wall active agent in the treatment of enterococcal PVE in patients allergic to penicillin. Rather, the classic longstanding approach to the treatment of such patients is a regimen combining <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> and an aminoglycoside. When the risk of nephrotoxicity with this regimen is unacceptable, patients should be desensitized to penicillin to allow treatment with penicillin or ampicillin plus an aminoglycoside.</p><p>The regimens outlined for treatment of enterococcal PVE in the following Tables have been predictably bactericidal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F50418\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef50418 \">table 4</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F104581\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef104581 \">table 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F64258\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64258 \">table 6</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-therapy-of-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. However, antibiotic resistance among enterococci has become significantly more common, necessitating careful testing of each strain causing endocarditis to select a synergistic regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-therapy-of-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. Penicillin-ampicillin resistance is due to alterations in penicillin-binding proteins. In that situation, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> is the cell wall active agent of choice. Occasionally, <em>Enterococcus faecalis</em> may be resistant to penicillin and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a> by virtue of beta-lactamase production. In this instance, vancomycin or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-and-sulbactam-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin-sulbactam</a> could be used as the cell wall active agent. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanisms-of-antibiotic-resistance-in-enterococci\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanisms of antibiotic resistance in enterococci&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the setting of high-level resistance to both <a href=\"topic.htm?path=streptomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">streptomycin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a>, synergy is not feasible and an aminoglycoside should <strong>not</strong> be administered. When resistance precludes bactericidal therapy, a prolonged course of 8 to 12 weeks of one of the cell wall active agents may be administered instead, but such therapy in patients with native valve endocarditis (NVE) has only a 40 percent chance of being successful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-therapy-of-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Data in NVE and, to a lesser extent, PVE caused by <em>E. faecalis</em> suggest that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a> may yield superior cure rates, comparable with those seen when treating with a cell wall active agent plus an aminoglycoside, as discussed below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-therapy-of-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>]. Surgery may be indicated for patients not sufficiently responsive to antimicrobial therapy.</p><p>In the setting of progressive nephrotoxicity, the duration of aminoglycoside administration may be reduced to less than six weeks. This was illustrated in a prospective study from Sweden of 93 episodes of enterococcal endocarditis that included 27 cases of prosthetic valve endocarditis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-therapy-of-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Clinical cure was achieved in 75 of 93 episodes (81 percent) overall and in 21 of 27 (78 percent) with PVE. In patients who achieved clinical cure, a cell wall active antimicrobial therapy was given for a median of 42 days and a synergistic aminoglycoside was added for a median of 15 days. The efficacy of an abbreviated course of the aminoglycoside component of therapy was subsequently confirmed in a Danish study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-therapy-of-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>A newer strategy for achieving a bactericidal effect on <em>E. faecalis</em> has been identified; it relies on<em> </em>achieving a bactericidal effect through expanded binding to the cell membrane penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) with two beta-lactam agents. The regimen of high-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ceftriaxone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ceftriaxone</a> (2 g intravenously [IV] every 12 hours) plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a> (2 g IV every 4 hours) has been used effectively to treat NVE and PVE caused by <em>E. faecalis</em>, including when high-level resistance to both <a href=\"topic.htm?path=streptomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">streptomycin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a> precludes synergy with beta-lactam or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a> plus aminoglycoside combinations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antimicrobial-therapy-of-prosthetic-valve-endocarditis/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>]. Although experience treating enterococcal PVE with this double beta-lactam regimen is somewhat limited, the regimen is appropriate for patients whose nephrotoxicity risk precludes significant aminoglycoside therapy, when nephrotoxicity emerges during therapy, or settings in which high-level aminoglycoside resistance prevents achieving synergy through traditional combination treatments. The double beta-lactam regimen is not effective for treatment of IE caused by <em>E. faecium</em> and also may not be effective for treatment of IE due to other non-faecalis enterococci.</p><p>Optimal therapy of PVE caused by vancomycin-resistant <em>Enterococcus faecium</em> (VRE) organisms, which often are also resistant to penicillin and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ampicillin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ampicillin</a> and highly resistant to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=streptomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">streptomycin</a>, has not been established (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F66444\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66444 \">table 7</a>). VRE are occasionally susceptible to penicillin and ampicillin and may not have high-level resistance to streptomycin and gentamicin.
