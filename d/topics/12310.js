The major biologic approaches in clinical use, including both medications made by molecular biologic techniques and small molecule kinase inhibitors, include agents that:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Interfere with cytokine function or production</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inhibit the &ldquo;second signal&rdquo; required for T-cell activation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Deplete B cells</p><p/><p>An overview of biologic agents, biosimilar medications with near-identity to the original biologic agents, and small molecule kinase inhibitors used in the management of patients with rheumatic disorders is reviewed here. The role of cytokines in the immune system and in rheumatic disorders, the management strategies for individual diseases, and a fuller discussion of the efficacy and safety of these agents are presented in detail separately.

Th cells and their cytokines can be categorized into two general subsets, termed Th1 and Th2, which differ in how they affect the immune system. The cytokines generated by Th1 or Th2 cells respectively inhibit the cellular function of the other phenotype [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-biologic-agents-and-kinase-inhibitors-in-the-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Additional cell types, termed Th17 cells and regulatory T cells (T reg), have also been described. Th cell differentiation and function are described in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=t-helper-subsets-differentiation-and-role-in-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;T helper subsets: Differentiation and role in disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Briefly, the following major subsets are important and of particular interest in the regulation of normal immune function and immune-mediated disorders:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Th1 cells</strong> &ndash; Th1 lymphocytes participate in a broad variety of inflammatory responses, including cell-mediated inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis, acute allograft rejection, graft-versus-host disease, and others. Some of the proinflammatory mediators produced by Th1 cells include interferon gamma (IFNg), tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and interleukin (IL)-2. IFNg and IL-2 can inhibit Th2 cell proliferation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Th2 cells</strong> &ndash; Th2 lymphocytes stimulate antibody production by B cells and augment eosinophil responses. The activation of Th2 cells contributes to the development of chronic graft-versus-host disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, and systemic sclerosis. A partial list of mediators produced by Th2 includes IL-4, -5, -10, and -13. IL-4 and IL-10 can inhibit Th1 cytokine production.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Th17 cells </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Th17 cells differentiate from na&iuml;ve T cells in response to antigen, transforming growth factor (TGF) beta, IL-6, and IL-23 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-biologic-agents-and-kinase-inhibitors-in-the-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Th17 cells secrete a cytokine, IL-17, which in concert with other cytokines affects inflammation, cartilage, and bone metabolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-biologic-agents-and-kinase-inhibitors-in-the-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>T reg cells</strong> &ndash; T reg cells function largely to regulate other T cells. They may have critical functions in multiple rheumatic diseases, including giant cell arteritis, granulomatosis with polyangiitis, rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, spondyloarthritis, Sj&ouml;gren&rsquo;s syndrome, and other conditions. T reg cells also differentiate under the influence of antigen and TGF beta, and they have a protective function through IL-10 and TGF beta [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-biologic-agents-and-kinase-inhibitors-in-the-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

However, these molecules retain binding affinities that are comparable to those of full-length membrane-bound receptors. The prototypical soluble receptor antagonist is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etanercept-including-biosimilars-of-etanercept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etanercept</a>, a fusion protein comprised of the p75 tumor necrosis factor (TNF) receptor linked to the Fc portion of human IgG1. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Etanercept'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytokine-networks-in-rheumatic-diseases-implications-for-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cytokine networks in rheumatic diseases: Implications for therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Soluble receptor molecules such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etanercept-including-biosimilars-of-etanercept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etanercept</a> bind their target cytokine while it is in serum, thereby inhibiting the cytokine&rsquo;s ability to interact with its cell surface receptors. Soluble fusion proteins must remain in the circulation for weeks in order to achieve their therapeutic effects. The half-life of etanercept is longer than that of the native soluble receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-biologic-agents-and-kinase-inhibitors-in-the-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Monoclonal antibodies to cytokines or their receptors</strong> &ndash; The second approach to the downregulation of cytokine function has been the use of mAbs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-biologic-agents-and-kinase-inhibitors-in-the-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In general, mAbs have a higher affinity for a given cytokine than do soluble receptors (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etanercept-including-biosimilars-of-etanercept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">etanercept</a>) that target the same molecule. mAbs have an additional theoretical advantage over soluble receptors in that they bind their target not only when it is free in the serum but also when it is bound to the cell surface.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Therapeutic mAbs used to treat patients with rheumatologic diseases typically consist of the Fc portion of human IgG1 and either chimeric or humanized Fab fragments. Examples of mAbs employed in the treatment of rheumatic disease are <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infliximab-including-biosimilars-of-infliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">infliximab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adalimumab-including-biosimilars-of-adalimumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">adalimumab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ustekinumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ustekinumab</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secukinumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">secukinumab</a>. Certolizumab, a polyethylene glycolated (PEGylated) Fab fragment that does not contain an Fc portion, has also been developed, as have other therapeutic antibodies derived from IgG2 and IgG4. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'TNF inhibition'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3132423889\" class=\"local\">'Ustekinumab'</a> below and <a href=\"#H395941591\" class=\"local\">'Secukinumab'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Cell surface receptor antagonist proteins </strong>&ndash; Recombinant cell surface receptor antagonists are biologically inactive proteins that compete with a cytokine for binding to the cytokine&rsquo;s membrane receptor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-biologic-agents-and-kinase-inhibitors-in-the-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Examples of cell surface receptor antagonists in the rheumatic diseases are anakinra and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rilonacept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rilonacept</a>, recombinant antagonists of the interleukin (IL)-1 receptor (see <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'IL-1 inhibition'</a> below). Another monoclonal antibody against a receptor is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=brodalumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">brodalumab</a>, an anti-IL-17 receptor antibody. (See <a href=\"#H587891650\" class=\"local\">'IL-17 inhibition'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Receptor antagonists must bind greater than 90 percent of the receptors on the cell surface to be effective. Large doses of the antagonist are required for such an effect.</p><p/><p>Another approach, which more indirectly targets an array of cytokines, is the use of orally administered small molecule drugs, produced by traditional manufacturing techniques, which are designed to inhibit selected cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinases, such as Janus kinase (JAK), which mediates signalling from membrane cytokine receptors. (See <a href=\"#H3220612907\" class=\"local\">'Kinase inhibition'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H842290356\"><span class=\"h1\">BIOLOGIC CYTOKINE INHIBITORS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">TNF inhibition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Five tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors are available for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and a number of other rheumatic and other immune-mediated diseases in the United States and worldwide. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Etanercept'</a> below and <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Infliximab'</a> below and <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Adalimumab'</a> below and <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Certolizumab'</a> below and <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Golimumab'</a> below.)</p><p>These drugs have been the subject of numerous trials and other studies, including multiple meta-analyses. As an example, a systematic literature review and meta-analysis of TNF-blocking agents for rheumatoid arthritis indicated that all five agents were equally efficacious and better than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-biologic-agents-and-kinase-inhibitors-in-the-rheumatic-diseases/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The combination of a TNF blocker and methotrexate was superior to either methotrexate or a TNF blocker alone, and the TNF blockers were relatively safe compared with methotrexate. The use and evidence for the efficacy of these agents in rheumatoid arthritis and other disorders are described in detail separately in the UpToDate topics on treatment of individual diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis and psoriasis, spondyloarthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, and others. (See appropriate topic reviews.)</p><p>The potential adverse effects of the TNF inhibitors are also described in detail separately.

These are highly targeted molecules which are relatively simple chemical compounds; unlike therapeutic agents made by recombinant DNA techniques (and thus termed &ldquo;biologics&rdquo;), such as monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and soluble truncated membrane receptors, the kinase inhibitors are not proteins and hence are not biologics. An advantage of these agents is that they can be orally administered. The Janus kinases (JAK) are cytoplasmic protein tyrosine kinases that are critical for signal transduction to the nucleus from the common gamma chain of the plasma membrane receptors for interleukin (IL)-2, -4, -7, -9, -15, and -21. One of these agents has become available for clinical use (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytokine-networks-in-rheumatic-diseases-implications-for-therapy#H2195654875\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cytokine networks in rheumatic diseases: Implications for therapy&quot;, section on 'Tofacitinib'</a>), and others are in development.
