The magnitude of this effect was illustrated in a cross-sectional survey of individuals in the United States who were examined between 1988 and 1994 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetanus-diphtheria-toxoid-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Only 47 percent of adults over the age of 20 had protective antibody to both diseases and only 63 percent of adults with immunity to tetanus also had protective antibody to diphtheria. In comparison, 91 percent of children from 6 to 11 years of age had protective antibody to both diseases. Immunity to pertussis also wanes among adolescents and adults. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pertussis-infection-epidemiology-microbiology-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pertussis infection: Epidemiology, microbiology, and pathogenesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The rationale and risk-benefit considerations for the administration of tetanus-diphtheria toxoid (Td) vaccination in adults will be reviewed here. The use of the booster vaccine containing tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap), immunizations in pregnant women, and the general principles behind adult immunization are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunizations-during-pregnancy#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunizations during pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis vaccination'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=standard-immunizations-for-nonpregnant-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Standard immunizations for nonpregnant adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pertussis-infection-in-adolescents-and-adults-treatment-and-prevention#H12882660\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pertussis infection in adolescents and adults: Treatment and prevention&quot;, section on 'Prevention'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY OF DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The epidemiology of tetanus and diphtheria is discussed in detail elsewhere but will be briefly reviewed here. Both infections are completely preventable with safe and effective toxoid vaccines.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Tetanus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of near universal vaccination of children with tetanus toxoid, the incidence of tetanus in the United States and the rest of the developed world has dropped dramatically and steadily since 1940. During the period between 2001 and 2008, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported that there were 233 cases of tetanus in the United States, with an annual incidence of 0.10 <span class=\"nowrap\">cases/million</span> population overall and 0.23 <span class=\"nowrap\">cases/million</span> among individuals &ge;65 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetanus-diphtheria-toxoid-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Unpredictable acute injuries remain the major cause of tetanus in the United States. </p><p>Despite the low rate of clinical disease, many adults are inadequately vaccinated against tetanus. In the serologic survey cited above in the United States between 1988 and 1994, fully protective levels of antitetanus antibody were present in 72 percent of individuals &ge;6 years of age and only 31 percent of adults over the age of 70 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetanus-diphtheria-toxoid-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Not surprisingly, protective antibody levels are more likely in adults with a history of military service, higher levels of education, higher incomes, and medical insurance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetanus-diphtheria-toxoid-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>Adults age 65 years and older are at highest risk for both tetanus and tetanus-related death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetanus-diphtheria-toxoid-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This is consistent with the decreasing proportion with age of persons who have received tetanus toxoid in the previous ten years among adults in the United States between 1993 and 1997: 65 percent between the ages of 18 and 49, 54 percent between the ages of 50 and 64, and 40 percent &ge;65 years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetanus-diphtheria-toxoid-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>In contrast to these observations in developed nations, approximately 1,000,000 cases of tetanus are estimated to occur in developing nations each year. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetanus#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tetanus&quot;, section on 'Epidemiology'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Diphtheria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 20 to 60 percent of adults become susceptible to diphtheria because of waning vaccine-induced immunity and failure to receive recommended booster immunization. This was illustrated in the serologic survey cited above in the United States between 1988 and 1994: fully protective levels of antidiphtheria antibody were present in 61 percent of individuals &ge;6 years of age and only 30 percent of adults over the age of 70 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetanus-diphtheria-toxoid-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Similar findings were noted in 1995 study of 1000 United Kingdom-born blood donors in North London: 38 percent were susceptible to diphtheria (serum <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphtheria-antitoxin-united-states-available-via-cdc-drug-service-investigational-drug-ind-protocol-only-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diphtheria antitoxin</a> concentration below 0.01 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/mL),</span> 31 percent had basic protection, and 31 percent were fully protected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetanus-diphtheria-toxoid-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Despite the frequent lack of immunity, there is still a low rate of clinical disease because immunization of the population has minimized the transmission of toxigenic strains. Only 45 cases of respiratory diphtheria were reported to the CDC from 1980 to 1996 (zero to five cases in any given year) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetanus-diphtheria-toxoid-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, unvaccinated or inadequately vaccinated travelers to endemic areas are at risk for acquiring this infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-pathophysiology-of-diphtheria\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and pathophysiology of diphtheria&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For reasons that are not well understood, pockets of diphtheria are reappearing, primarily in developing countries. The epidemics have involved nonimmunized or poorly immunized adults in addition to children.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR TD OR TDAP VACCINATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Routine immunization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the serologic survey of individuals examined in the United States between 1988 and 1994, only 47 percent of adults over the age of 20 had protective antibody to both diseases and only 63 percent of adults with immunity to tetanus also had protective antibody to diphtheria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetanus-diphtheria-toxoid-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Waning immunity against tetanus and diphtheria is responsible for the recommendation for universal administration of Td boosters every 10 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetanus-diphtheria-toxoid-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The United States Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) also recommends a single dose of a vaccine containing tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap; Adacel or Boostrix) 0.5 mL IM in place of Td for <strong>all</strong> adults aged 19 years and older who have not received Tdap previously to address waning immunity against pertussis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetanus-diphtheria-toxoid-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Boostrix has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for individuals 10 years of age and older, whereas Adacel has only been approved for individuals between the ages of 10 and 64 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetanus-diphtheria-toxoid-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. In adults aged 65 years and older, Boostrix should be used when possible. If only Adacel is available, it may be used in this age group, since it has been shown to be immunogenic. </p><p>The ACIP recommends that all pregnant women receive vaccination against pertussis with Tdap during <strong>each</strong> pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetanus-diphtheria-toxoid-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Detailed recommendations are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunizations-during-pregnancy#H17\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunizations during pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis vaccination'</a>.)</p><p>When indicated, Tdap should be administered regardless of the interval since the last dose of Td [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetanus-diphtheria-toxoid-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. This represents a change from previous ACIP guidelines, which recommended that Tdap be given a minimum of two years after the last dose of Td in most cases. The following Figures summarize the ACIP recommendations for immunization of adults without and with comorbidities, respectively (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F82634\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82634 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F62130\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62130 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetanus-diphtheria-toxoid-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/7,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,9</a>].

Incomplete vaccination is more likely in the following groups:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Injection drug users</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immigrants</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rural populations</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Older adults</p><p/><p>For patients who have received fewer than three doses or an unknown number of doses of a tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine, tetanus immunization should be administered (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61087\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61087 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetanus-diphtheria-toxoid-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The preferred vaccine preparation depends upon the age and vaccination history of the patient. For patients with clean minor wounds who have received three or more doses of a tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine, another dose should be given only if the last dose was given 10 or more years ago. For patients with wounds that are more severe than a clean and minor wound (such as, but not limited to, wounds contaminated with dirt, feces, soil, or saliva; puncture wounds; avulsions; wounds resulting from missiles, crushing, burns, or frostbite) who have received three or more doses of a tetanus toxoid-containing vaccine, another dose should be given only if the last dose was given five or more years ago. The vaccine series should be continued through completion as necessary. If there is any doubt about whether or not an adult received the primary series, three doses of Td should be administered; the first dose and second dose should be separated by four weeks and the third dose should be given 6 to 12 months later (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F82634\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82634 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F62130\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62130 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p>Since inadequate protection against diphtheria and tetanus often occur together [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetanus-diphtheria-toxoid-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>], Td is the preferred vaccine, not tetanus toxoid alone. The tetanus toxoid, reduced diphtheria toxoid, and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine should be used in place of Td in adults who have an indication. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Routine immunization'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pertussis-infection-in-adolescents-and-adults-treatment-and-prevention#H12882660\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pertussis infection in adolescents and adults: Treatment and prevention&quot;, section on 'Prevention'</a>.)</p><p>The importance of ensuring that pregnant women have completed their primary series and have received a Tdap booster during each pregnancy is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immunizations-during-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immunizations during pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In addition to tetanus immunization, human <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetanus-immune-globulin-human-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetanus immune globulin</a> (250 units intramuscularly [IM]) is indicated in individuals who have sustained a wound that is more severe than a clean and minor wound (eg, wounds contaminated with dirt, feces, soil, or saliva; puncture wounds; avulsions; wounds resulting from missiles, crushing, burns, or frostbite) <strong>and</strong> who have either received fewer than three doses of tetanus toxoid previously or in whom the number of previous doses is unknown.</p><p>Appropriate tetanus prophylaxis should be administered as soon as possible following a wound but should be given even to patients who present late for medical attention. This is because the incubation period is quite variable; the incubation period of tetanus is approximately 8 days but ranges from 3 to 21 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/tetanus-diphtheria-toxoid-vaccination-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].
