The majority of patients with PSC have underlying inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Patients with concurrent PSC and IBD have an increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-inflammatory-bowel-disease-and-colorectal-cancer/abstract/1-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-6</a>]. This topic review will focus on the epidemiology, pathogenesis, clinical features, diagnosis, and management of IBD in patients with PSC in addition to the risk of CRC and guidelines for CRC surveillance. CRC surveillance in patients with IBD is presented separately.

Patients with proctocolectomy with ileal pouch anal anastomosis also have an increased risk of pouchitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-inflammatory-bowel-disease-and-colorectal-cancer/abstract/9,11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11,12</a>].

Endoscopic features of colitis are non-specific and include erythema, granularity of the mucosa, petechiae, exudates, edema, and erosions. The endoscopic appearance of the colon may be normal even in the presence of active underlying colonic inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-inflammatory-bowel-disease-and-colorectal-cancer/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H333654175\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given the high prevalence of IBD in patients with PSC, colonoscopy is recommended at the time of initial diagnosis of PSC regardless of the presence of symptoms of colitis (eg, rectal bleeding, diarrhea). IBD in PSC does not have any characteristic, endoscopic, or histologic features. As with all cases of IBD, the diagnosis requires evidence of colonic inflammation and chronic changes on biopsy. Since these features are not specific for UC or CD, establishing the diagnosis also requires the exclusion of other causes of colitis by history, laboratory studies, and by biopsies of the colon obtained on colonoscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-inflammatory-bowel-disease-and-colorectal-cancer/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Random biopsies of the colon should be obtained even if the mucosa appears endoscopically normal as a significant number of patients may not have symptoms or endoscopic evidence of colitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-inflammatory-bowel-disease-and-colorectal-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The evaluation to exclude other causes of colitis is discussed in detail separately.

Among patients with IBD, an increased risk of CRC in patients with ulcerative colitis (UC) complicated by PSC has been observed in a number of studies. In one case-control study, the cumulative absolute risk of CRC or dysplasia after 10, 20, and 25 years of colitis in patients with PSC and UC was significantly higher as compared with patients with UC alone (9, 31, and 50 percent versus 2, 5, and 10 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-inflammatory-bowel-disease-and-colorectal-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, the CRC risk in patients with concomitant Crohn disease (CD) and PSC is unclear and results have been conflicting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-inflammatory-bowel-disease-and-colorectal-cancer/abstract/1-3,19-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3,19-22</a>]. This was illustrated in a 2016 meta-analysis that included 16 observational studies. The meta-analysis concluded that the CRC risk was increased by approximately threefold in patients with PSC and IBD as compared with those with IBD alone (odds ratio [OR] 3.24; 95% CI 2.14-4.9) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-inflammatory-bowel-disease-and-colorectal-cancer/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. When the results were stratified by IBD subtype, the presence of PSC in patients with UC but not CD was associated with an increased risk of colorectal neoplasia and CRC. However, only three studies in the meta-analysis included patients with CD and PSC. Additional studies are needed to confirm these findings. </p><p>Several studies have suggested that the risk of CRC is increased following liver transplantation, however, the CRC risk may be related to the duration of IBD and not the transplant itself [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-inflammatory-bowel-disease-and-colorectal-cancer/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In a meta-analysis of 16 cohort studies that included 1017 patients, the incidence of CRC in patients with PSC-IBD and an intact colon at the time of liver transplantation was 13.5 per 1000 person-years. A long duration of IBD and extensive colitis were identified as risk factors for CRC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-inflammatory-bowel-disease-and-colorectal-cancer/abstract/13,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,25</a>].(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-in-adults-management#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Primary sclerosing cholangitis in adults: Management&quot;, section on 'Liver transplantation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1876888971\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mechanism by which concomitant PSC increases the risk of colonic neoplasia in patients with IBD is unknown. It has been hypothesized that this is due to the increased concentration of secondary bile acids in the proximal colon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-inflammatory-bowel-disease-and-colorectal-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Secondary bile acids (eg, deoxycholic acid and lithocholic) are cytotoxic to colonic epithelial cells, induce hyperproliferation, and may also influence the development of sporadic colonic adenomas and CRC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-inflammatory-bowel-disease-and-colorectal-cancer/abstract/26-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-30</a>]. In support of this hypothesis is the observation that patients with UC, colonic dysplasia, or CRChave higher fecal bile acid concentrations than those without colonic neoplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-inflammatory-bowel-disease-and-colorectal-cancer/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Furthermore, IBD in PSC tends to be characterized by rectal sparing and backwash ileitis, suggesting that epithelial injury may be relatively more severe in the proximal colon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-inflammatory-bowel-disease-and-colorectal-cancer/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. PSC patients also have a disproportionately higher likelihood of developing CRC proximal to the splenic flexure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-inflammatory-bowel-disease-and-colorectal-cancer/abstract/3,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,19</a>]. </p><p>Chronic inflammatory activity may be the driver of carcinogenesis. Colitis in patients with PSC can have low endoscopic activity, which may mask an active histologic inflammation that possibly contributes to an increased risk of malignancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-sclerosing-cholangitis-inflammatory-bowel-disease-and-colorectal-cancer/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

Ulcerative colitis (UC), Crohn disease (CD), and indeterminate colitis account for 80, 10, and 10 percent, respectively. (See <a href=\"#H3217288893\" class=\"local\">'Inflammatory bowel disease'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Colitis in patients with PSC presents earlier in life as compared with patients with IBD alone. IBD in PSC patients usually has a mild or quiescent course. Patients are often asymptomatic, but in rare cases, present with rectal bleeding. (See <a href=\"#H1452753384\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PSC patients with IBD often have a pancolitis. Less often, the colitis is right sided with relative sparing of the rectum or there is terminal ileal involvement. The colon may also be normal in endoscopic appearance even in the presence of active underlying inflammation. (See <a href=\"#H748390894\" class=\"local\">'Endoscopic features'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Given the high prevalence of IBD in patients with PSC, colonoscopy should be performed at the time of initial diagnosis of PSC regardless of the presence of symptoms of colitis (eg, rectal bleeding, diarrhea). IBD in PSC does not have any characteristic endoscopic or histologic features. The diagnosis requires evidence of colonic inflammation and chronic changes on biopsy and exclusion of other causes of colitis. (See <a href=\"#H333654175\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H929706836\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with PSC and IBD have an approximately threefold increase in risk of CRC as compared with patients with IBD alone. Among patients with IBD, an increased risk of CRC in PSC patients with concomitant UC has been demonstrated in multiple studies, however, the CRC risk in patients with concomitant CD is unclear. (See <a href=\"#H2207749269\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CRC in patients with concomitant PSC and IBD is more often right sided and is diagnosed earlier as compared with sporadic CRC with a median age at diagnosis of 49 years. Most patients are asymptomatic and CRCs are detected on screening. (See <a href=\"#H1452753384\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The management of CRC in PSC associated with IBD does not differ from other patients with CRC. However, patients undergoing colectomy should be informed of surgery-related complications including a higher risk of pouchitis and peristomal varices, and patients should be monitored closely for hepatic decompensation following proctocolectomy. (See <a href=\"#H1744530131\" class=\"local\">'Management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although several agents have been evaluated for prevention of CRC in patients with concomitant PSC and IBD, none have conclusively been demonstrated to decrease the risk of CRC.
