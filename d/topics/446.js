The adrenal glands are small organs that sit on top of each kidney (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F67279\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67279 \">figure 1</a>). The adrenal glands make different hormones.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1999106\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of adrenal cancer?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When adrenal cancer causes symptoms, it does this in different ways. Some adrenal cancers make abnormally high levels of hormones. Depending on the hormones involved, this can cause symptoms such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight gain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Muscle weakness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble sleeping</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A deep voice and increased hair growth, usually on the face (in women)</p><p/><p>Adrenal cancer can also cause other symptoms that have nothing to do with abnormally high levels of hormones. These can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain in the belly, or on the side or lower back</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weight loss or loss of appetite</p><p/><p>All of the symptoms listed above can also be caused by conditions that are not adrenal cancer. But if you have these symptoms, tell your doctor or nurse.</p><p>Some people with adrenal cancer have no symptoms. They find out they have it after their doctor does an imaging test for another reason. Imaging tests create pictures of the inside of the body.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1999121\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for adrenal cancer?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Tests for adrenal cancer usually include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood and urine tests to measure the levels of different hormones</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An imaging test such as a CT or MRI scan</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1999136\"><span class=\"h1\">What is cancer staging?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cancer staging is a way in which doctors find out if a cancer has spread past the layer of tissue where it began, and, if so, how far.</p><p>The right treatment for you will depend a lot on the stage of your adrenal cancer and your other medical problems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1999151\"><span class=\"h1\">How is adrenal cancer treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people with adrenal cancer are treated with surgery to remove the cancer.</p><p>After surgery, people might have other treatments that can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chemotherapy &ndash; Chemotherapy is the medical term for medicines that kill cancer cells or stop them from growing. The medicine most often used for adrenal cancer is called &quot;mitotane.&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radiation therapy &ndash; Radiation kills cancer cells.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1999166\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens after treatment?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After treatment, your doctor will check you every so often to see if the cancer comes back. Follow-up tests include exams, blood tests, and imaging tests.</p><p>You should also watch for the symptoms listed above. Having those symptoms could mean your adrenal cancer has come back. Tell your doctor or nurse if you have any symptoms.</p><p>You might also need to take long-term medicines to correct the levels of hormones in your body. To monitor your hormone levels, your doctor will do regular follow-up blood tests.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1999181\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens if my adrenal cancer comes back or spreads?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your adrenal cancer comes back or spreads, you might have more chemotherapy, surgery, or radiation therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1999196\"><span class=\"h1\">What else should I do?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It's important to follow all of your doctor's instructions about visits and tests. It's also important to talk to your doctor about any side effects or problems you have during treatment.</p><p>Getting treated for adrenal cancer involves making many choices, such as what treatment to have. Always let your doctors and nurses know how you feel about a treatment. Any time you are offered a treatment, ask:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the benefits of this treatment? Is it likely to help me live longer? Will it reduce or prevent symptoms?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What are the downsides to this treatment?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Are there other options besides this treatment?</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>What happens if I do not have this treatment?</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1999211\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cushings-syndrome-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cushing's syndrome (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-therapy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Radiation therapy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=managing-pain-when-you-have-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Managing pain when you have cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=when-your-cancer-treatment-makes-you-tired-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: When your cancer treatment makes you tired (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=managing-loss-of-appetite-and-weight-loss-with-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Managing loss of appetite and weight loss with cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nausea-and-vomiting-with-cancer-treatment-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nausea and vomiting with cancer treatment (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hair-loss-from-cancer-treatment-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hair loss from cancer treatment (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-care-during-advanced-illness-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medical care during advanced illness (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cushings-syndrome-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Cushing's syndrome (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cushings-syndrome-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Cushing's syndrome treatment (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
