Similarly, over 20 percent of kidney transplants performed in the United States go to patients who have failed one or more renal allografts.</p><p>The most common cause of graft failure after the first year is an incompletely understood clinicopathological entity variously called chronic rejection, transplant nephropathy, chronic renal allograft dysfunction, transplant glomerulopathy (TG), chronic allograft injury, or chronic renal allograft nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-renal-allograft-nephropathy/abstract/1-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-10</a>].</p><p>The revised Banff 2005 classification system, which was reported in 2007, renamed chronic allograft nephropathy, &quot;interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy <span class=\"nowrap\">(IF/TA),</span> without evidence of any specific etiology&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-renal-allograft-nephropathy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This was done because the term &quot;chronic allograft nephropathy&quot; was thought to diminish attempts to determine the underlying cause of the histologic lesions.</p><p>The Banff 2005 classification also added the category &quot;chronic active antibody-mediated rejection (AMR)&quot; as a subset of AMR. It is characterized by C4d+, presence of circulating anti-donor antibodies, and morphologic evidence of chronic tissue injury, such as glomerular double contours <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> peritubular capillary basement membrane multilayering <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">IF/TA</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fibrous intimal thickening in arteries.</p><p>In the Banff 2013 classification, the requirement for C4d staining for the diagnosis of <span class=\"nowrap\">acute/active</span> and chronic active AMR was replaced by histologic evidence of antibody interaction with the endothelium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-renal-allograft-nephropathy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Such evidence could include positivity, moderate microvascular inflammation, or increased gene expression suggestive of endothelial injury. Importantly, the Banff group recognized the existence of C4d-negative AMR.</p><p>Although the term &quot;chronic allograft nephropathy&quot; may be inaccurate, the newer attempts at terms do not to seem to produce a significant improvement, which we have retained in this topic review.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS, DIAGNOSIS, AND PATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The exact incidence of chronic renal allograft nephropathy is unclear since there are no universally accepted diagnostic criteria for this disorder. In general, it is a poorly understood process that is defined as renal allograft dysfunction (occurring at least three months posttransplant) in the absence of active acute rejection, drug toxicity (principally calcineurin inhibitors), or other diseases. There are also diagnostic features on biopsy. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathology'</a> below.)</p><p>The clinical diagnosis is usually suggested by gradual deterioration of graft function, as manifested by slowly rising plasma creatinine concentration, increasing proteinuria (occasionally causing nephrotic-range proteinuria), and worsening hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-renal-allograft-nephropathy/abstract/4,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,13</a>]. However, the reliance on these clinical features commonly results in the late identification of chronic renal allograft nephropathy, frequently culminating in allograft loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-renal-allograft-nephropathy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-the-patient-with-renal-allograft-dysfunction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and diagnosis of the patient with renal allograft dysfunction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathology</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathologic changes of chronic allograft nephropathy involve all parts of the renal parenchyma including the blood vessels, glomeruli, interstitium, and tubules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-renal-allograft-nephropathy/abstract/4,14-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,14-16</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The vessel walls are thickened by the subintimal accumulation of loose and then organized connective tissue, variable mononuclear cellular infiltration, proliferation of myofibroblasts, and disruption and duplication of the internal elastic lamina (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F72574%7ENEPH%2F52555%7ENEPH%2F65391\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef72574 graphicRef52555 graphicRef65391 \">picture 1A-C</a>). It has been proposed that endothelial inflammation and injury is one of the primary events, leading to progressive intimal thickening and narrowing of the vascular lumen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-renal-allograft-nephropathy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. These changes are similar to those seen in the thrombotic microangiopathies, such as the hemolytic-uremic syndrome (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-acquired-ttp-and-other-primary-thrombotic-microangiopathies-tmas\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of acquired TTP and other primary thrombotic microangiopathies (TMAs)&quot;</a>). Immunofluorescence staining in chronic renal allograft nephropathy may be positive for immunoglobulin G (IgG), C3, and fibrin. Excess fibrin deposition may arise from persistent induction of type 1 plasminogen activator inhibitor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-renal-allograft-nephropathy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The glomerular capillary walls are thickened with an occasional double-contour appearance, resembling that seen in membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) but without dense deposits. Interstitial fibrosis with tubular atrophy and the presence of this type of double-contour appearance are considered the most characteristic findings for chronic nephropathy within the Banff classification system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-renal-allograft-nephropathy/abstract/12,16,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,16,18,19</a>] (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Banff grading system'</a> below). The glomeruli may also be enlarged and show a lobular pattern; segmental or, in severe cases, global sclerosis also may be seen. Electron microscopy may show mesangial cell interposition and subendothelial accumulation of electron-lucent material (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F58239%7ENEPH%2F79914\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58239 graphicRef79914 \">picture 2A-B</a>). Immune complex deposition is generally not a prominent part of transplant glomerulopathy (TG). The term &quot;transplant glomerulopathy&quot; is now most commonly used to describe this picture of MPGN without prominent immune complex deposition. In some cases, however, the pattern resembles that seen in membranous nephropathy, with prominent subepithelial deposits. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=membranous-nephropathy-and-renal-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Membranous nephropathy and renal transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The interstitium shows variable degrees of patchy fibrosis and focal cellular infiltrates with lymphocytes and plasma cells, associated with a variable degree of tubular atrophy and tubular cell dropout. These nonspecific findings are also found to varying degrees with many disorders, particularly calcineurin inhibitor nephrotoxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-renal-allograft-nephropathy/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peritubular capillary basement membrane splitting and lamination may be relatively specific; these abnormalities, which are only observed by electron microscopy, are found in 60 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-renal-allograft-nephropathy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Banff grading system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A classification of the severity of chronic renal allograft nephropathy, called the Banff classification, was formulated in 1997 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-renal-allograft-nephropathy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>] and updated in 2005 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-renal-allograft-nephropathy/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], with further comments in 2007, 2009 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-renal-allograft-nephropathy/abstract/19,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,21,22</a>], and 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-renal-allograft-nephropathy/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Although glomerular and vascular findings may be more specific for the disorder, this schema grades disease severity according to the amount of interstitial fibrosis and the degree of atrophy and loss of tubules <span class=\"nowrap\">(IF/TA):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade</span> I &ndash; Mild fibrosis of the interstitium (ie, affecting 6 to 25 percent of the cortical area) and mild atrophy of the tubules (ie, up to 25 percent of the area of the cortical tubules), either with or without specific glomerular or vascular findings suggestive of chronic allograft nephropathy (see above).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade II &ndash; Moderate interstitial fibrosis (ie, affecting 25 to 50 percent of the cortical area) and moderate tubular atrophy (ie, involving 26 to 50 percent of the area of the cortical tubules), with or without specific changes as in Grade I.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade III &ndash; Severe interstitial fibrosis (ie, affecting &gt;50 percent of the cortical area) and tubular atrophy (ie, involving &gt;50 percent of the area of the cortical tubules), with or without specific changes as in Grade I.</p><p/><p>Within this system, the severity of glomerular, mesangial matrix, and vascular change is also quantified, but is not integrated within the grading system.</p><p>Histopathologic evidence of chronic nephropathy using different versions of this system correlate with adverse long-term outcomes, including elevated concentrations of serum creatinine and lower rates of graft survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-renal-allograft-nephropathy/abstract/23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-25</a>]. As an example, one study evaluated the outcomes of 280 transplant patients, in whom 282 protocol biopsies were obtained three months after transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-renal-allograft-nephropathy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. At 10 years after surgery, allograft survival was 95, 82, and 41 percent among those without chronic nephropathy (175 patients); with chronic nephropathy, but without vasculopathy (87 patients); and with both chronic nephropathy and vasculopathy (21 patients), respectively. The impact of the various stages of <span class=\"nowrap\">IF/TA</span> as described above on allograft prognosis has yet to be defined.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">C4d deposition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic renal allograft nephropathy may also be observed in association with humoral anti-donor antibodies and the deposition of complement fragment C4d. The Banff 2013 commentary also recognized the entity of C4d negative antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-renal-allograft-nephropathy/abstract/12,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,26</a>].</p><p>These findings have been also described in patients with acute allograft rejection.

The evaluation of an individual with chronic allograft dysfunction begins with renal ultrasonography, with Dopplers of the renal artery to assess size and echogenicity of the kidney and to exclude renal artery stenosis. We estimate proteinuria by determining urine protein-to-creatinine ratio. We perform a renal biopsy on patients who have protein excretion that is &gt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span>.</p><p>We assess for presence of donor-specific antibodies and for the presence of BK virus.

It is the view of the authors that allograft histology is useful for confirming the diagnosis and also to rule out other processes, such as acute rejection or recurrent glomerulonephritis.

Issues related to membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN) are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Similar histologic findings'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">More specifically, the presence of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) on transplant biopsy must be distinguished from recurrent disease in those patients in whom primary FSGS was responsible for the initial renal failure. The history is often helpful in this setting. The onset of proteinuria typically occurs within days or a few weeks in recurrent FSGS and is rapid in onset; in comparison, protein excretion does not begin to increase until three months or more after transplantation and then rises slowly in the chronic de novo disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=focal-segmental-glomerulosclerosis-in-the-transplanted-kidney\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis in the transplanted kidney&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Polyoma virus allograft nephropathy &ndash; Polyoma virus allograft nephropathy (PVAN) typically presents with subacutely progressive allograft dysfunction. The diagnosis may be suggested by the presence of &quot;decoy&quot; cells by urine cytology (Papanicolaou stain), more specifically, by the presence of the virus in blood (or urine) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The diagnosis of BK-induced nephropathy is established by specific findings with allograft biopsy, particularly results with immunohistochemical staining <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ultrastructural examination of the specimen by electron microscopy.

Acute allograft rejection, which is diagnosed by characteristic histologic findings, is discussed in detail separately.

Thus, an elevation in plasma creatinine concentration in this setting is suggestive, but not diagnostic, of renovascular disease in the allograft. Persistent uncontrolled hypertension, flash pulmonary edema, and an acute elevation in blood pressure are other common features of this disorder. The diagnosis of renal artery stenosis is based on findings with imaging studies.

However, since the renal transplant is not innervated, pain and discomfort that may be observed in nontransplant patients are normally absent. Radiologic evidence of obstruction is most commonly determined by initial evaluation with ultrasonography, showing hydronephrosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-urinary-tract-obstruction-and-hydronephrosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of urinary tract obstruction and hydronephrosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Similar histologic findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Chronic renal allograft nephropathy must primarily be distinguished histologically from those disorders that can cause a MPGN pattern <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a predominant interstitial fibrosis on renal biopsy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MPGN &ndash; The MPGN pattern of transplant glomerulopathy (TG) must be distinguished from other glomerular disorders, particularly MPGN that is associated with hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection or is due to recurrent or de novo disease. These disorders may appear similar on light microscopy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The distinction may be made on electron microscopy, which typically shows thickening and duplication of the glomerular basement membranes without immune deposits in TG; by comparison, there are prominent subendothelial immune deposits in HCV-associated MPGN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-renal-allograft-nephropathy/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. HCV positivity alone is not sufficient to make the distinction, since it may be present concurrently in patients with chronic renal allograft nephropathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hepatitis-c-infection-in-kidney-transplant-candidates-and-recipients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hepatitis C infection in kidney transplant candidates and recipients&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Interstitial fibrosis &ndash; The presence of marked interstitial fibrosis due to chronic renal allograft nephropathy must be differentiated from other causes of fibrosis, particularly that induced by calcineurin inhibitors (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>). In this setting, histologic evidence of the characteristic glomerulopathy or the presence of peritubular capillary basement membrane splitting and lamination is most consistent with chronic renal allograft nephropathy. By comparison, the detection of newly formed hyaline arteriolar changes is specific for cyclosporine nephrotoxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-renal-allograft-nephropathy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">However, chronic renal allograft nephropathy is not always associated with these characteristic findings, and the arteriolar changes suggestive of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> disease may not be new. It is therefore frequently difficult if not impossible to distinguish between these two possibilities, based upon the results of microscopy alone. Some individuals also have pathologic changes resulting from both disorders.

Direct support for ongoing immunologic factors in chronic allograft loss is reported by a retrospective study in which, among over 4000 recipients of human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-identical sibling transplants, patients with no panel reactive antibodies (PRAs) had significantly higher 10-year survival (72 percent) versus those with either 1 to 50 percent PRA (63 percent) or &gt;50 percent PRA (56 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-renal-allograft-nephropathy/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].

The incidence of chronic renal allograft nephropathy is &lt;1 percent in patients who had had no episodes of acute rejection.

In one report, for example, the incidence of chronic renal allograft nephropathy as a cause of graft loss was significantly higher in the 307 patients with more than one acute rejection episode compared with the 354 treated for only one episode (35 versus 9 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-renal-allograft-nephropathy/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>The increased incidence of chronic renal allograft nephropathy in these patients is associated with a worse long-term renal outcome in grafts surviving for more than one year. When compared with patients with no acute rejection, those with episodes of acute rejection had reductions in the estimated half-life of graft survival (6.6 versus 12.5 years) and in the creatinine clearance one to five years after transplantation (45 to 47 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> versus 54 to 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min)</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-renal-allograft-nephropathy/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p>There is also some evidence that chronic antibody-mediated rejection (AMR) may have a role in this disorder.

By comparison, some immunosuppressive agents, particularly calcineurin inhibitors, may also be associated with impaired long-term allograft function, which is frequently difficult if not impossible to distinguish from chronic allograft nephropathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-and-tacrolimus-nephrotoxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cyclosporine and tacrolimus nephrotoxicity&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Similar histologic findings'</a> above.)</p><p>A large variety of different immunosuppressive approaches and alterations in medical regimens have been evaluated <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> are the subject of ongoing study to limit the risk of developing or aggravating chronic renal allograft nephropathy.

As an example, a study based upon an analysis of the United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) database found that the improvement in overall renal allograft function in the 1990s could largely be attributed to the period that coincided with the introduction of mycophenolate mofetil and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> into maintenance immunosuppressive regimens with or without acute rejection, although a minority of this benefit was due to a decreased rate of acute rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-renal-allograft-nephropathy/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].

In some patients, for example, the glomeruli in the transplant show areas of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS), rather than the &quot;membranoproliferative&quot; pattern described above. These lesions are more likely to occur in larger glomeruli, suggesting that the hypertrophic response to too few nephrons and the associated intraglomerular hypertension eventually injure the glomerular capillary wall [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-renal-allograft-nephropathy/abstract/59-62\" class=\"abstract_t\">59-62</a>].</p><p>This mechanism of renal injury, which is similar to that seen on many forms of slowly progressive chronic renal failure, could explain the reduced transplant survival (3.5 to 12.5 percent at three years) in settings in which the kidney is too &quot;small&quot; for the recipient: child to adult, female to male, and transplantation into patients weighing &gt;100 kg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-renal-allograft-nephropathy/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].

Animals with the native kidney (and therefore twice the number of nephrons) had less hyperfiltration and hypertrophy and less proteinuria and glomerulosclerosis.</p><p>However, subsequent data have not confirmed the importance of nephron number on transplant survival.

The kidney volume to body surface ratio was not a predictor of graft survival or of the development of chronic renal allograft nephropathy.</p><p>The possible importance of relative renal size may not be limited to the transplant recipient.

These findings suggest that different treatment strategies for chronic nephropathy, based in part upon time posttransplantation (prevention of rejection in the first year and, in stable patients, limiting calcineurin exposure in the subsequent years), may prove effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-renal-allograft-nephropathy/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>].</p><p>However, a later study of adult recipients of solitary kidneys transplanted between 1998 and 2004 suggested that severe histologic changes are not common in the first five years after transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-renal-allograft-nephropathy/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. Among 447 one-year biopsies, interstitial fibrosis was minimal or mild in 87 and moderate or severe in only 13 percent of biopsies; arterial hyalinosis was mild or absent in the majority of biopsies.

In the prospective, multicenter Genomics of Chronic Allograft Rejection (GoCAR) study, protocol renal allograft biopsies were performed among 101 renal transplant recipients at 3 and 12 months posttransplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/chronic-renal-allograft-nephropathy/abstract/131\" class=\"abstract_t\">131</a>]. Biopsies were assessed for chronic allograft damage using the Revised Banff 2009 classification system and Chronic Allograft Damage Index (CADI). A microarray analysis of three-month biopsies was performed to identify correlations between gene expression at three months and the severity of histologic damage and fibrosis (ie, CADI score) at 12 months. The analysis identified a set of 13 genes that independently predicted the development of histologic injury (CADI score &ge;2) at 12 months and was superior to demographic, clinical, and pathological parameters. Among patients with minimal or no fibrosis at three months, the gene set differentiated between those who would and would not progress to fibrosis at 12 and 24 months posttransplant and identified patients at increased risk of renal allograft loss at two and three years postbiopsy. The predictive value of the gene set was validated using a separate cohort of 45 protocol biopsies as well as two independent publicly available gene expression datasets. Although further studies are needed, this gene set represents a promising approach that could be used to identify patients who are at greater risk of fibrosis and allograft loss and who may benefit from therapeutic strategies to prevent the progression to fibrosis.

The clinical diagnosis is suggested by gradual deterioration of graft function as manifested by slowly rising plasma creatinine concentration, increasing proteinuria, and worsening hypertension. Pathologic changes involve all parts of the renal parenchyma, including the blood vessels, glomeruli, interstitium, and tubules. The glomerular capillary walls are thickened, with an occasional double-contour appearance resembling that seen in membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN), but without dense deposits. Interstitial fibrosis with tubular atrophy <span class=\"nowrap\">(IF/TA)</span> and the presence of this type of double-contour appearance are considered the most characteristic findings for chronic nephropathy within the Banff classification system.

Despite the possible increased risk of chronic allograft nephropathy due to calcineurin-inhibitor therapy, we feel that the immunosuppressive benefits of this regimen outweigh its possible adverse effects.
