Individual dietary factors may also reduce blood pressure (BP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diet-in-the-treatment-and-prevention-of-hypertension/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Nondietary modalities of lifestyle modification should also be considered, including cessation of smoking and institution of an aerobic exercise regimen. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=smoking-and-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Smoking and hypertension&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exercise-in-the-treatment-and-prevention-of-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Exercise in the treatment and prevention of hypertension&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Most of the studies on nonpharmacologic therapy evaluated only a single factor to prove its efficacy (eg, weight reduction without sodium restriction). In making recommendations to the individual patient, however, the clinician will try to modify all of the factors that may be contributing to the elevation in BP, although it is uncertain if the effects of different modifications are additive.</p><p>In those with elevated blood pressure or stage 1 hypertension, lifestyle changes may control the BP adequately [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diet-in-the-treatment-and-prevention-of-hypertension/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, in those with either higher BP or additional risk (eg, diabetes or chronic kidney disease), drug therapies should first be used to more quickly and effectively control the BP. Once BP is well controlled, lifestyle changes should be strongly advised. If these are successfully achieved, reduction of medications may be possible.</p><p>This topic will review the effect of comprehensive dietary modification, as well as the effects of individual dietary interventions on BP.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPREHENSIVE DIETARY MODIFICATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several studies have looked at the efficacy of comprehensive dietary modification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diet-in-the-treatment-and-prevention-of-hypertension/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In one, antihypertensive therapy was discontinued in patients who had been well controlled for two or more years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diet-in-the-treatment-and-prevention-of-hypertension/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The patients were then randomized into two groups: one maintained on a relatively standard diet and one on a diet that stressed salt restriction, weight reduction, and avoidance of excess alcohol intake. At four years, hypertension had recurred in over 90 percent in the control group but in only 60 percent with dietary intervention, with evidence of a plateau between the third and fourth years (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F59980\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59980 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment of Mild Hypertension Study</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the Treatment of Mild Hypertension Study (TOMHS), 902 patients with mild diastolic hypertension (90 to 100 mmHg) were started on a program consisting of weight reduction, sodium and alcohol restriction, and increased physical activity. Patients were then randomly assigned to placebo or to one of five different antihypertensive drugs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diet-in-the-treatment-and-prevention-of-hypertension/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. There were initial improvements in all of the dietary parameters that tended to diminish over time (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F67978\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67978 \">figure 2</a>). Despite the difficulty in maintaining optimal compliance, those patients who remained on the lifestyle program had an average 8.<span class=\"nowrap\">6/8</span>.6 mmHg fall in blood pressure (BP) at four years.</p><p>Although the response to nonpharmacologic therapy alone was less than that seen if drug therapy were added [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diet-in-the-treatment-and-prevention-of-hypertension/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], dietary modifications have the additional cardiovascular advantage of lowering plasma total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol and raising high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antihypertensive-drugs-and-lipids\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antihypertensive drugs and lipids&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension trial</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A different approach was evaluated in the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diet-in-the-treatment-and-prevention-of-hypertension/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Rather than evaluating sodium intake or weight loss, DASH randomly assigned 459 patients with BPs of less than <span class=\"nowrap\">160/80</span> to 95 mmHg to one of three diets:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A control diet low in fruits, vegetables, and legumes and high in snacks, sweets, meats, and saturated fat.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, legumes and low in snacks and sweets.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A combination diet rich in fruits, vegetables, legumes, and low-fat dairy products and low in snacks, sweets, meats, and saturated and total fat (this combination diet is called the &quot;DASH diet&quot;). The DASH diet is comprised of four to five servings of fruit, four to five servings of vegetables, two to three servings of low-fat dairy per day, and &lt;25 percent fat.</p><p/><p>The following observations were noted in which the BP reductions were expressed in relation to the fall in BP seen with the control diet:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The fruits and vegetables diet reduced the BP by 2.<span class=\"nowrap\">8/1</span>.1 mmHg, and the combination diet reduced the BP by 5.<span class=\"nowrap\">5/3</span>.0.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>These effects were more pronounced in patients with hypertension. With the combination diet, for example, the BP fell 11.<span class=\"nowrap\">4/5</span>.5 mmHg in hypertensives versus 3.<span class=\"nowrap\">5/2</span>.1 mmHg in the normotensives.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The antihypertensive effects were maximal by the end of week 2 with any of the diets and were then maintained for eight weeks.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Low-sodium DASH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The low-sodium DASH trial evaluated the effect of varying sodium intake in combination with consuming the DASH diet described above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diet-in-the-treatment-and-prevention-of-hypertension/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In this study, 412 participants were randomly assigned to a control or DASH diet and, within each diet, ate foods with three levels of sodium content (3.5, 2.3, and 1.2 g) for 30 days each. The following results were reported:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Independent of sodium intake, the DASH diet resulted in significantly lower systolic and diastolic BP levels than the control diet. With the high-, intermediate-, and low-sodium intakes, the systolic pressure was 5.9, 5.0, and 2.2 mmHg lower with the DASH diet than with the control diet, respectively. Comparable values for the diastolic pressure were 2.9, 2.5, and 1.0 mmHg lower with the DASH diet.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With either diet, lowering the sodium intake reduced BP levels, an effect observed among those with and without hypertension and among different races and sex.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When different phases of diet were compared, the most significant decrease in BP was observed between the <strong>high</strong>-sodium control diet and <strong>low</strong>-sodium DASH diets as a comparative overall reduction of 8.9 and 4.5 mmHg in systolic and diastolic BPs, respectively, was noted with the low-sodium DASH diet. This benefit was even more significant among hypertensive individuals. The mean fall in systolic BP was 11.5 mmHg.</p><p/><p>Thus, the combination of a low-sodium and DASH diet resulted in the most significant benefit, with decreases in BP comparable with those observed with antihypertensive agents.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">PREMIER trial</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The PREMIER trial was designed to assess the additive BP effects of two different behavioral interventions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diet-in-the-treatment-and-prevention-of-hypertension/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. In this study, 810 patients with above optimal blood pressure (120 to 159 mmHg systolic pressure <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> 80 to 95 mmHg diastolic pressure) were randomly assigned to one of three groups: 1) &quot;established behavioral intervention&quot; (eg, weight loss, physical activity, and limitations in sodium and alcohol intake); 2) the DASH diet plus &quot;established behavioral intervention&quot;; and 3) one-time advice only. Unlike the original DASH study, the subjects prepared their own food. To assess the effects on BP of the interventions, the effect of advice only (6.<span class=\"nowrap\">6/3</span>.8 mmHg decrease) was subtracted from the BP change in the intervention groups.</p><p>At six months, the DASH diet plus behavioral intervention produced a small additional decrease in BP versus that observed with behavioral intervention alone (4.<span class=\"nowrap\">3/2</span>.6 mmHg and 3.<span class=\"nowrap\">7/1</span>.7 mmHg, respectively). The prevalence of mild hypertension at study end was significantly less in the two intervention groups (12 and 17 percent in DASH plus established and established group, respectively) than in the advice-only arm (26 percent). At 18-month follow-up, the prevalence of hypertension had increased in all three groups, but remained lowest in the two intervention groups (22 and 24 percent in DASH plus established and established group, respectively, versus 32 percent in the advice only) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diet-in-the-treatment-and-prevention-of-hypertension/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> below.)</p><p>Overall, the absolute effects on BP of DASH plus those of behavioral intervention were not additive. Possible reasons for this less than expected effect of the DASH diet included the requirement that the subjects prepared their own food, so there was less rigorous adherence to the diet than in the other DASH studies, where all the food was provided; a large BP decrease in the advice-only control group; and a possible similar physiologic mechanism for BP lowering for both interventions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diet-in-the-treatment-and-prevention-of-hypertension/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Diet versus antihypertensive agents</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are limited data concerning the relative efficacy of lifestyle interventions (particularly diet) versus antihypertensive agents on BP control or cardiovascular outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diet-in-the-treatment-and-prevention-of-hypertension/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Despite this absence of evidence of relative effectiveness, we and most experts feel that diet plays an important role in many susceptible patients in the genesis and maintenance of hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diet-in-the-treatment-and-prevention-of-hypertension/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">SALT RESTRICTION AND WEIGHT REDUCTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The potential beneficial effects of salt restriction and, in overweight patients, weight reduction in hypertensive patients are discussed separately.

Other modalities, such as stress reduction and supplements of calcium, magnesium, or fish oil, appear to induce a small and less predictable reduction in BP in most patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diet-in-the-treatment-and-prevention-of-hypertension/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. Moreover, in a meta-analysis covering 7 clinical trials and 32 observational studies, the consumption of a vegetarian diet was associated with a 4.<span class=\"nowrap\">8/2</span>.2 mmHg lower BP, compared with those consuming an omnivorous diet [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diet-in-the-treatment-and-prevention-of-hypertension/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].

A metaregression analysis of 36 trials of fish oil, of which 22 had a double-blind design, found that the intake of a median dose of 3.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/day</span> of fish oil provided statistically significant reductions of both systolic and diastolic pressures (2.<span class=\"nowrap\">1/1</span>.6 mmHg) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diet-in-the-treatment-and-prevention-of-hypertension/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>The long-term safety of fish oil in doses high enough to lower the BP is at present unknown. Potential toxicities include a bleeding tendency due to prolongation of the bleeding time, a possible decline in renal function due to decreased production of the renal vasodilator prostaglandin E2, eructations, the sensation of a fishy taste, and a possible deleterious effect on lipid metabolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diet-in-the-treatment-and-prevention-of-hypertension/abstract/19,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,22</a>].

Despite this absence of evidence of relative effectiveness, we and most experts feel that diet plays an important role in many susceptible patients in the genesis and maintenance of hypertension. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Comprehensive dietary modification'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High-dose, but not low-dose, fish oil supplements may reduce systemic BP, but the long-term safety of fish oil in doses high enough to lower the BP is unknown. Fish intake in combination with weight loss may have additive effects on BP reduction. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Fish oil'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dietary calcium and calcium supplements have a relatively small effect on BP. The effect of supplemental calcium on BP is too small to recommend the use of calcium supplements for the therapy or prevention of hypertension. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Calcium'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dietary interventions that may be associated with reduced BP include dietary fiber, magnesium, soy (vegetable) or dairy protein intake, folate, and possibly polyphenols (eg, flavonoids). (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Other dietary interventions'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiovascular-effects-of-caffeine-and-caffeinated-beverages#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiovascular effects of caffeine and caffeinated beverages&quot;, section on 'Blood pressure'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dietary and lifestyle modifications have been evaluated in a number of studies for the prevention rather than treatment of hypertension. The optimal effect on BP is achieved with correction of multiple contributors to hypertension, including salt intake, obesity, and excess alcohol intake.
