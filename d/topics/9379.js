It is the most common abdominal emergency in early childhood, particularly in children younger than two years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The majority of cases in children are idiopathic, and pathologic lead points are identified in only 25 percent of cases involving children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Intussusception is unusual in adults, and the diagnosis is commonly overlooked. In the majority of cases in adults, a pathologic cause is identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>The first successful surgical correction of intussusception in an infant was described in 1871 by Hutchinson. In 1876, Hirschsprung reported his experience with the treatment of intussusception by enema. This technique was associated with approximately 35 percent mortality, considerably better than the mortality rates after surgery. Reduction of intussusception by fluoroscopy-guided enema was described as early as 1927, and was soon incorporated by radiologists as part of their expertise. The technique has further evolved to include ultrasound as an additional imaging option. Reduction was traditionally performed using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> or other liquid contrast agents (hydrostatic enema), but can also be performed using air or carbon dioxide (pneumatic enema) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of intussusception in infants and children are discussed below. Intussusception in adults is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-management-of-mechanical-small-bowel-obstruction-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of management of mechanical small bowel obstruction in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intussusception typically presents between 6 and 36 months of age, and is the most common cause of intestinal obstruction in this age group. Approximately 60 percent of children with intussusception are younger than one year old, and 80 to 90 percent are younger than two years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In a population-wide survey in Switzerland, the yearly mean incidence of intussusception was 38, 31, and 26 cases per 100,000 live births in the first, second, and third year of life, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. After the third year of life, the incidence fell to less than one-half of these rates.</p><p>Although intussusception is most common in infants and toddlers, it is important to consider this diagnosis in children outside this age range. About 10 percent of cases occur in children over five years; 3 to 4 percent in those over 10 years; and 1 percent in infants younger than 3 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. When intussusception does occur outside of the typical age range, it is likely to be associated with a pathologic lead point, which may include reactive lymphoid hyperplasia. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Lead point'</a> below.)</p><p>Most episodes occur in otherwise healthy and well-nourished children. Intussusception appears to have a slight male predominance, with a male:female ratio of approximately 3:2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2596268030\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES AND TERMINOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intussusception refers to the invagination (telescoping) of a part of the intestine into a more distal segment. The proximal segment is known as the <strong>intussusceptum</strong>, and distal segment into which it telescopes is known as the <strong>intussuscipiens</strong>. </p><p>The intussusception is classified by the location (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F116900\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef116900 \">figure 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ileocolic</strong> intussusception involves the ileocecal junction, and accounts for 90 percent of all cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Ileo-ileal</strong>, <strong>ileo-ileo-colic</strong>, <strong>jejuno-jejunal</strong>, <strong>jejuno-ileal</strong>, or <strong>colo-colic</strong> intussusception also have been described. </p><p/><p>The intussusception is considered <strong>idiopathic</strong> if there is no identifiable mass in the intussusceptum (no &quot;lead point&quot;) (see <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Lead point'</a> below). The intussusception can be idiopathic even if there was a likely or possible triggering event, such as viral or other enteric infection. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Idiopathic'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As the intussusception develops, the mesentery is dragged into the bowel. This leads to the development of venous and lymphatic congestion with resulting intestinal edema. If untreated, the process can ultimately lead to ischemia, perforation, and peritonitis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Idiopathic</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 75 percent of cases of childhood intussusception are considered to be idiopathic because there is no clear disease trigger or pathologic lead point. Idiopathic intussusception is most common in children between three months and five years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h3\">Influence of viral factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An increasing body of evidence suggests that viral triggers may play a role in some cases, as illustrated by the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incidence of intussusception has a seasonal variation, with peaks coinciding with seasonal viral gastroenteritis in some populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/6,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intussusception has been associated with some forms of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rotavirus-vaccine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">rotavirus vaccine</a>. An early form of the vaccine (RRV-TV: Rotashield) was removed from the market because of a 22-fold increase in intussusception among vaccinated infants. Providers should be alert for cases of intussusception that may be associated with rotavirus vaccine, and report all suspected cases to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS). The risk of intussusception associated with currently licensed vaccines is discussed in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rotavirus-vaccines-for-infants#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Rotavirus vaccines for infants&quot;, section on 'Intussusception'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 30 percent of patients experience viral illness (upper respiratory tract infection, otitis media, flu-like symptoms) before the onset of intussusception.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A strong association with adenovirus infection has been shown in a variety of populations. In 30 to 40 percent of cases, there is evidence of recent infection with enteric and nonenteric species of adenovirus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/9-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-13</a>]. In a prospective case-control study examining a variety of possible infectious triggers for intussusception in Vietnam and Australia, infection with adenovirus, species C emerged as the strongest predictor of intussusception in both populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In these populations, rotavirus infection and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=poliovirus-vaccine-inactivated-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">poliovirus vaccine</a> administration were not associated with intussusception.</p><p/><p>Viral infections, including enteric adenovirus, can stimulate lymphatic tissue in the intestinal tract, resulting in hypertrophy of Peyer patches in the lymphoid-rich terminal ileum, which may act as a lead point for ileocolic intussusception (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F71734\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef71734 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/9,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,14</a>]. Because of this putative association with lymphoid hyperplasia, treatment with glucocorticoids has been suggested to prevent recurrence, but this approach is not generally recommended. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Recurrence'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30053241\"><span class=\"h3\">Other enteric infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Bacterial enteritis is also associated with intussusception. In a series of 1412 cases of bacterial enteritis seen at military treatment facilities, intussusception ensued in 37 patients (comprising 12.6 percent of all intussusceptions seen at these facilities) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. This association was noted for infection with <em>Salmonella</em>, <em>Escherichia coli</em>, <em>Shigella</em>, or <em>Campylobacter</em>. Most cases of intussusception occurred within the first month after the bacterial enteritis. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Lead point</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A lead point is a lesion or variation in the intestine that is trapped by peristalsis and dragged into a distal segment of the intestine, causing intussusception (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F116900\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef116900 \">figure 1</a>). A Meckel diverticulum, polyp, duplication cyst, tumor, hematoma, or vascular malformation can act as a lead point for intussusception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Underlying disorders</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In approximately 25 percent of cases, an underlying disease causes a pathologic lead point for the intussusception, which may be focal or diffuse. Such triggers account for a greater proportion of cases of intussusception in children younger than three months or older than five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/1,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,17,18</a>]. Nonetheless, it is important to be vigilant for pathologic lead points in children of any age.</p><p>A variety of conditions have been associated with intussusception, including Meckel diverticulum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>], polyps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], small bowel lymphoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>], duplication cysts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>], vascular malformations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>], inverted appendiceal stumps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>], parasites (eg, Ascaris lumbricoides) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>], immunoglobulin A vasculitis (IgAV; Henoch-Sch&ouml;nlein purpura [HSP]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>], cystic fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], and hemolytic-uremic syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. Meckel diverticulum is the most common pathologic lead point in most case series in children, followed by polyps, and then either duplication cysts or IgAV (HSP) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (Refer to appropriate UpToDate topic reviews).</p><p>The mechanisms leading to intussusception depend upon the specific cause. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Meckel diverticulum, polyps, duplication cysts, lymphomas, areas of reactive lymphoid hyperplasia, or other focal abnormalities of the intestinal tract act as lead points for peristalsis advancing the intestine into a distal segment of intestine. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meckels-diverticulum\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Meckel's diverticulum&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With IgAV (HSP), a small bowel wall hematoma acts as the lead point. Intussusception typically occurs after resolution of the abdominal pain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=iga-vasculitis-henoch-schonlein-purpura-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;IgA vasculitis (Henoch-Sch&ouml;nlein purpura): Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients with cystic fibrosis, thick inspissated stool may act as the lead point [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cystic-fibrosis-overview-of-gastrointestinal-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cystic fibrosis: Overview of gastrointestinal disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Celiac disease appears to be associated with a modestly increased risk for intussusception, as suggested by a large study in Sweden [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The proposed mechanism is that celiac disease may promote small bowel intussusception because of dysmotility and excessive secretions or bowel wall weakness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. Subclinical intussusception has been reported in about 25 percent of children with newly diagnosed celiac disease, and typically resolves spontaneously during the first few days on a gluten-free diet, without radiologic or operative intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Conversely, the Swedish study found no association between intussusception and future celiac disease, arguing against the need for routine antibody testing for children with intussusception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathogenesis-and-clinical-manifestations-of-celiac-disease-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathogenesis, and clinical manifestations of celiac disease in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with Crohn disease may develop intussusception because of inflammation and stricture formation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-crohn-disease-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of Crohn disease in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Postoperative</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Small bowel intussusception (usually jejuno-jejunal or ileo-ileal) has been described in the postoperative setting where it is an uncommon but insidious cause of intestinal obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/39-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-42</a>]. Most cases occur after abdominal surgery (especially open procedures), but there is also a modest increased risk after nonabdominal procedures. The intussusception is thought to be caused by uncoordinated peristaltic activity <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> traction from sutures or devices such as a gastrojejunal feeding tube [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. Affected patients typically do well for several days and may even resume oral intake before developing symptoms of mechanical obstruction. In many cases, this is an incidental finding <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> spontaneously resolves. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Asymptomatic intussusception'</a> below.)</p><p>The diagnosis can be difficult to establish because intussusception may be confused with postoperative paralytic ileus. Evaluation with ultrasonography or computed tomography (CT) scanning can establish the diagnosis, monitor for spontaneous reduction, and help to predict which children are likely to need surgical reduction. Because most cases of postoperative intussusception occur in the small intestine, contrast enemas do not usually contribute to the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Small bowel intussusception'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Typical presentation</strong> &ndash; The classic presentation of intussusception is an infant or toddler with the sudden onset of intermittent, severe, crampy, progressive abdominal pain, accompanied by inconsolable crying and drawing up of the legs toward the abdomen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The episodes usually occur at 15- to 20-minute intervals. They become more frequent and more severe over time. Vomiting is often a prominent symptom, often starting shortly after the first episodes of abdominal pain. Initially, emesis may be nonbilious, but it often becomes bilious as the obstruction progresses. A sausage-shaped abdominal mass may be felt in the right side of the abdomen. The stool is grossly bloody in up to 50 percent of cases, and an additional 25 percent have occult blood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. In some cases, the stool may be a mixture of blood and mucous, giving it the appearance of currant jelly, but this is a late finding and seen in a minority of patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-acute-abdominal-pain-in-children-and-adolescents\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of acute abdominal pain in children and adolescents&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Between the painful episodes, the child may behave relatively normally and be free of pain. As a result, initial presentation can be confused with that of gastroenteritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. As symptoms progress, increasing lethargy often develops, which can be mistaken for meningoencephalitis. Some authors have hypothesized that the lethargy is caused by increased levels of endogenous opioids, suggested by cases with pupillary miosis and reversal with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naloxone-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">naloxone</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Atypical presentation</strong> &ndash; However, the classically described triad of pain, a palpable sausage-shaped abdominal mass, and currant-jelly stool is seen in less than 15 percent of patients at the time of presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/45,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,47</a>]. Up to 20 percent of young infants have no obvious pain, and approximately one-third of patients do not pass blood or mucus, nor do they develop an abdominal mass. Many older children have pain alone without other signs or symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Occasionally, the initial presenting sign is lethargy or altered consciousness alone, without pain, rectal bleeding, or other symptoms that suggest an intraabdominal process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/48-52\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-52</a>]. This clinical presentation primarily occurs in infants and is often confused with sepsis. Thus, intussusception should be considered in the evaluation of otherwise unexplained lethargy or altered consciousness, especially in infants.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Incidental finding</strong> &ndash; An intussusception is sometimes discovered incidentally during an imaging study performed for other reasons or for nonspecific symptoms. If these intussusceptions are short in duration and the patient is asymptomatic, they can be managed with observation alone. Patients with minimal symptoms may also not require intervention. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Asymptomatic intussusception'</a> below.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3270575705\"><span class=\"h2\">History and physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because the presentation of intussusception is variable, a high index of suspicion for intussusception is important, particularly in children between three months and five years of age, which is the peak age range for idiopathic intussusception, or those with other risk factors.

In these cases, the procedure is both diagnostic and therapeutic. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Nonoperative reduction'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1944103463\"><span class=\"h3\">Atypical presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For many other patients, the diagnosis is unclear at presentation, especially in children who are younger or older than the typical age group for intussusception. In this case, initial workup may include abdominal ultrasound or abdominal radiographs, provided that these studies do not significantly delay the definitive treatment of intussusception. If the ultrasound supports the diagnosis of intussusception, nonoperative reduction is then performed, provided that the child has normal vital signs and no signs of peritonitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Nonoperative reduction'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Ultrasonography</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Ultrasonography is the method of choice to detect intussusception in many institutions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. The sensitivity and specificity of this technique approach is 100 percent in the hands of an experienced ultrasonographer. Negative predictive value is also nearly 100 percent, so a negative study by an experienced sonographer can definitively rule out intussusception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Ultrasound is better able to detect pathologic lead points than fluoroscopic techniques, can be used to monitor the success of a reduction procedure, and does not expose the patient to radiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/18,55-58\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,55-58</a>]. Ultrasound can also evaluate for several alternative causes for the child's symptoms, such as appendicitis or hydronephrosis. In other institutions, fluoroscopy is used as the primary diagnostic and therapeutic procedure for intussusception. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Fluoroscopic or sonographic guidance'</a> below.)</p><p>The classic manifestation of intussusception on ultrasound is a &quot;target sign&quot; (also known termed &quot;bull's eye&quot; or &quot;coiled spring&quot;), representing layers of the intestine within the intestine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F114377\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef114377 \">image 1</a>). For ileocolic intussusception, which is the most common type, the &quot;target sign&quot; usually is in the right lower quadrant. Color duplex imaging may reveal a lack of perfusion in the intussusceptum, indicating the development of ischemia. An advantage of ultrasonography over fluoroscopy is that it can diagnose the rare ileo-ileal intussusception; ultrasound also can identify the lead point of intussusception in approximately two-thirds of cases in which underlying pathology exists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p>The possibility of small bowel intussusception (eg, jejuno-jejunal or jejuno-ileal,<strong> </strong>rather than ileocolic intussusception) is suggested by location of the intussusception outside of the right lower quadrant (eg, in the paraumbilical or left abdominal region), <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lesion size &le;3 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. If small bowel intussusception is suspected and the child's symptoms are mild, the first step is to repeat the ultrasound to see if the finding persists, because most small bowel intussusceptions will spontaneously reduce. If the finding persists, evaluation with a CT scan may help to confirm the location of the intussusception and whether there is a lead point. In small bowel intussusceptions, the length of the intussusceptum, as measured by ultrasound or CT, and the patient's symptoms help to determine prognosis and management. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Small bowel intussusception'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Abdominal plain film</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with suspected intussusception, the initial evaluation usually should include a plain abdominal radiograph. The main purpose of the radiograph is to exclude perforation, which, if present, requires operative management rather than nonoperative reduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>]. They are also useful to screen for other causes of abdominal symptoms that might be detected by radiography. </p><p>Plain radiographs are not sufficiently sensitive or specific to diagnose intussusception, but may support the diagnosis if one or more of the following findings are present: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Signs of intestinal obstruction, which may include massively distended loops of bowel with absence of colonic gas (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F56921\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef56921 \">image 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A target sign, consisting of two concentric radiolucent circles superimposed on the right kidney, represents peritoneal fat surrounding and within the intussusception.

The sensitivity for abdominal radiographs to diagnose intussusception is less than 48 percent while the specificity is 21 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In one study, more than 20 percent of patients with intussusception had negative plain films [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. In patients with a low clinical suspicion of intussusception, the presence of air in the cecum or terminal ileum helps to exclude intussusception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. However, ultrasound is far superior to radiography both for diagnosing and excluding intussusception. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">CT scan</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An intussusception can be recognized on computed tomography (CT), which may also identify the cause (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F114379\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef114379 \">image 4</a>). However, CT cannot be used to reduce the intussusception, can be time-consuming in children who may require sedation, and also exposes the child to substantial radiation. Thus, CT generally is reserved for patients in whom the other imaging modalities are unrevealing, or to characterize pathologic lead points for intussusception detected by ultrasound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4011690798\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of intussusception can be made in any of the following ways:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>By diagnostic ultrasound &ndash; This is the usual procedure where diagnostic ultrasound is readily available (eg, in the emergency department), or for patients with atypical presenting features.

It is important that nonoperative reduction be performed at an institution with extensive experience in the technique and by providers with experience in managing potential complications of nonoperative reduction, such as tension pneumoperitoneum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Patients presenting to an institution without this experience should be transferred if this can be done promptly. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Nonoperative reduction'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acutely ill or with perforation &ndash; Surgical treatment is indicated as a primary intervention for patients with suspected intussusception who are acutely ill or have evidence of perforation. Surgery may also be appropriate when the patient is treated in a location where the radiographic facilities and expertise to perform nonoperative reduction are not readily available and if timely patient transfer would not be feasible. Operative intervention is also indicated for patients in whom nonoperative reduction is unsuccessful, or for evaluation or resection of a pathologic lead point. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Small bowel intussusception &ndash; Patients with intussusception limited to the small bowel (ileo-ileal, jejuno-ileal, or jejuno-jejunal) are managed differently. (See <a href=\"#H23\" class=\"local\">'Small bowel intussusception'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Nonoperative reduction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nonoperative reduction using hydrostatic or pneumatic pressure by enema is the treatment of choice for an infant or child with ileocolic intussusception who is clinically stable and has no evidence of bowel perforation or shock, when appropriate radiologic facilities are available. Enema reduction has high success rates in children with ileocolic intussusception. In settings in which nonoperative reduction is not available (eg, in resource-limited countries), patients with intussusception usually should be managed with surgical reduction. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> below.) </p><p>Before attempting reduction by enema, the patient should be stabilized and given intravenous fluids if there is evidence of volume depletion. The surgical team should be notified before attempting nonoperative reduction and remain immediately available because there is a risk of perforation during the procedure. Surgical intervention also may be necessary if nonoperative reduction fails to reduce the intussusception. (See <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> below.) </p><p>There are no compelling data to help guide the use of intravenous antibiotics before performing nonoperative reduction. In some institutions, antibiotics are administered before attempting nonoperative reduction because of the risk of bacteremia and potential perforation with these procedures. However, the utility of preprocedural antibiotics for nonoperative reduction has not been well studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. Bacteremia rarely occurs after nonoperative reduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>], and the risk of perforation is only about 1 percent (see <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Risk and complications'</a> below). Therefore, in our practice, we do not routinely use prophylactic intravenous antibiotics prior to nonoperative reduction. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Fluoroscopic or sonographic guidance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reduction of intussusception is most commonly performed under fluoroscopic guidance, using either hydrostatic (saline or contrast) or pneumatic (air) enema. Ultrasound guidance is also an increasingly used option, and has the advantage of avoiding ionizing radiation, as well as improved detection of pathologic lead points compared with fluoroscopic technique. As a result, some providers with expertise in this technique prefer to use ultrasound guidance to reduce ileocolic intussusception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/70-76\" class=\"abstract_t\">70-76</a>]. A disadvantage of ultrasound is that it can only be used for hydrostatic reduction. Fluoroscopy and ultrasound-guided techniques have comparable success rates for reduction of intussusception, ranging from 80 to 95 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/54,71,72,77,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,71,72,77,78</a>]. </p><p>The techniques are performed as follows: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Sonographic guidance</strong> &ndash; Sonographic guidance requires a hydrostatic technique (saline enema) to provide retrograde pressure, because use of air would interfere with ultrasound visualization. Sonographic signs of successful reduction include the disappearance of the intussusception and the appearance of water and bubbles in the terminal ileum. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Fluoroscopic guidance</strong> &ndash; Under fluoroscopy for a typical ileocolic intussusception, the intussusceptum appears as a filling defect within the bowel lumen. This is seen as either a low density filling defect when contrast is used for hydrostatic reduction, or a higher density filling defect when air is used as a negative contrast with pneumatic reduction techniques (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F54310\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef54310 \">image 5</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F114380\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef114380 \">image 6</a>). The intussusception can be found in any part of the large bowel, even the rectum. Occasionally, contrast may coat the outer surface of the intussuscipiens, resulting in a coiled spring pattern. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Successful reduction is indicated by the free flow of contrast or air into the small bowel. Reduction is complete only when a good portion of the distal ileum is filled with contrast or air, thus excluding ileo-ileal intussusception. Other indications of successful reduction include relief of symptoms and disappearance of the abdominal mass. Occasionally, the contrast material does not reflux freely into the small bowel even after a complete reduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]; however, a successful reduction is suggested by lack of a filling defect in the cecum (apart from the ileocecal valve), and clinical resolution of symptoms and signs. A post-reduction filling defect in the cecum commonly is seen, probably the result of residual edema in the ileocecal valve. However, this finding cannot be distinguished from a focal lead point by radiologic examination alone. As a result, a repeat study or even laparotomy may be indicated if there is any concern for a focal lead point [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H851758373\"><span class=\"h3\">Hydrostatic or pneumatic reduction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Either pneumatic (air) or hydrostatic (saline or contrast) technique is acceptable for reduction of intussusception in stable children. The choice of technique depends primarily upon the expertise and comfort level of the radiologist, and availability of the necessary equipment. </p><p>In our institution, pneumatic reduction is the method of choice, rather than hydrostatic reduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. This is because pneumatic reduction of intussusception has somewhat higher success rates and no increased risk of perforation. This was shown in a meta-analysis, which reported a success rate of 83 percent for pneumatic reduction, and 70 percent for hydrostatic reduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. There was no difference in rate of perforation (0.39 and 0.43 percent, respectively), or of early recurrence within the first 48 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. In addition, pneumatic reduction may be advantageous if perforation occurs (see <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Risk and complications'</a> below). Finally, pneumatic reduction typically requires a lower overall radiation exposure dose compared with hydrostatic enema, which is independent of the fluoroscopy time required for the procedure. This is likely because air has a lower density than the contrast that is typically used for hydrostatic reduction, and thus reduces the exposure required for generating the image with fluoroscopy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. </p><p>In other institutions the hydrostatic enema technique is used, either because it is the primary nonoperative method available, or if ultrasound guidance is used.</p><p>The techniques are performed as follows: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hydrostatic technique</strong> &ndash; The standard method of reduction is to place a reservoir of contrast 1 meter above the patient so that constant hydrostatic pressure is generated. With experience (and depending upon the clinical status of the patient), a physician may undertake a more aggressive reduction (ie, increase the hydrostatic pressure by raising the reservoir higher above the patient).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>When hydrostatic reduction is performed under fluoroscopic guidance, a water-soluble contrast enema is preferred because of the risk of perforation before or during the procedure. Water-soluble agents reduce the risk of electrolyte disturbances and peritonitis in patients in whom perforation has occurred [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. Traditionally, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">barium</a> was used as the contrast agent in most North American and European centers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F54310\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef54310 \">image 5</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/84-86\" class=\"abstract_t\">84-86</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>When hydrostatic reduction is performed under ultrasonographic guidance, normal saline is used for the enema. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Fluoroscopic or sonographic guidance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pneumatic technique</strong> &ndash; Pneumatic (air reduction) techniques are now generally preferred to the hydrostatic methods if fluoroscopy is used for guidance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/81,82\" class=\"abstract_t\">81,82</a>]. The pneumatic technique cannot be used with ultrasonography because the air interferes with ultrasound visualization.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The technique begins with insertion of a Foley catheter (or equivalent) or rectal tube into the rectum. A tight anal seal is formed around the catheter or tube, typically using tape and is critical as a means to minimize air leak and maintain adequate pressure for reduction throughout the procedure. Fluoroscopy is used to monitor the procedure. Air is then instilled until the intussusceptum is pushed back gently, taking care to avoid excessive pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/84,85\" class=\"abstract_t\">84,85</a>]. A sphygmomanometer can be used to monitor colonic intraluminal pressure (typically not to exceed 120 mm Hg) to aid in reduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. Carbon dioxide can also be used instead of air. It has the advantage of being absorbed rapidly from the gut, is associated with less discomfort, and is less dangerous than air, which potentially could cause an air embolism (although air embolisms have not been reported).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A successful reduction of the intussusception is indicated by a rush of air reflux into the terminal ileum, a sudden drop in the intraluminal pressure, and the disappearance of the mass at the ileocecal valve (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F114380\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef114380 \">image 6</a>). Water-soluble contrast material can be instilled to confirm the reduction, or the air reduction can be repeated if the completeness of reduction is questioned [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Risk and complications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main risk of hydrostatic or pneumatic reduction is perforation of the bowel, which occurs in 1 percent or fewer patients (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F114381\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef114381 \">image 7</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/71,82,89-91\" class=\"abstract_t\">71,82,89-91</a>]. The perforation usually occurs on the distal side of the intussusception, often in the transverse colon, and commonly where the intussusception was first demonstrated by radiographic studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/92,93\" class=\"abstract_t\">92,93</a>]. Risk factors for perforation include age younger than six months, long duration of symptoms (eg, three days or longer), and evidence of small bowel obstruction; use of higher pressures during the reduction is a contributing factor in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/71,94\" class=\"abstract_t\">71,94</a>]. Nonoperative reduction should not be attempted in patients with any signs of peritoneal irritation or free peritoneal air. </p><p>The pneumatic reduction technique provides an advantage if perforation occurs, because air is generally less harmful than other contrast materials in the peritoneal cavity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. When perforation is noted with air reduction, the colonic wall tears are smaller than those observed with the hydrostatic contrast techniques, and peritoneal pathology tends to be minimal. Needle decompression of the abdomen may be necessary if the excess air in the peritoneal cavity compromises the patient's respiratory status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">Success rate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In institutions with extensive experience, nonoperative reduction using hydrostatic or pneumatic techniques is successful in approximately 70 to 85 percent of patients with ileocolic intussusception [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/6,71,82,95-97\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,71,82,95-97</a>]. Success is more likely to be achieved in patients with idiopathic intussusception (ie, no identifiable lead point), although it also can be accomplished in patients with a recognized lead point [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. The supplemental use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=glucagon-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">glucagon</a> to relax colonic smooth muscle was of no benefit in a double-blind study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>].</p><p>lleo-ileo-colic intussusception may be more difficult to reduce because the contrast often percolates along the loops of small bowel in the colon, reducing the effective pressure of the enema.</p><p>In addition, success is less likely to be achieved in infants younger than one year of age (particularly younger than three months), and in children older than five years of age (due to increased likelihood of a pathologic lead point), and when plain films show signs of intestinal obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/89,95,99,100\" class=\"abstract_t\">89,95,99,100</a>]. Although some authors have noted a reduced likelihood of reduction when symptoms have been present for longer than 48 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/89,97,99,101\" class=\"abstract_t\">89,97,99,101</a>], others have found no such correlation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. </p><p>For patients presenting with prolonged symptoms, nonoperative reduction is often successful, although the overall success rate is somewhat lower than in patients with a more recent onset of symptoms. Studies have reported successful pneumatic reduction of intussusception after prolonged symptoms, as long as 240 hours (and a median time of 18.5 hours), after initial symptoms, suggesting that nonoperative reduction should remain the primary initial treatment method regardless of the length of history in a stable child [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>]. In these more complicated cases, a pediatric surgeon should be readily available in case the nonoperative reduction is not successful.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33761090\"><span class=\"h3\">Delayed repeat enema</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the nonoperative reduction is <strong>partly</strong> successful (ie, the intussusception moved but was not completely reduced) and the patient remains stable, it is reasonable to perform a second attempt at nonoperative reduction, often referred to as delayed repeat enema. The time gap or delay between nonoperative enema attempts varies from 30 minutes to a few hours. There is some evidence that this approach is successful and avoids surgery for some patients who would have otherwise required surgical reduction following initial unsuccessful reduction attempts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/71,103-106\" class=\"abstract_t\">71,103-106</a>]. </p><p>Delayed repeat enema should <strong>not</strong> be attempted in patients in whom the initial attempt at nonoperative reduction was <strong>completely</strong> unsuccessful (ie, the intussusception did not move), or in those who are unstable. Such patients should proceed promptly to surgery. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3916877867\"><span class=\"h3\">Post-procedure management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no compelling data or widely used guidelines for clinical care after successful nonoperative reduction of an ileocolic intussusception. Our own practice is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibiotics &ndash; We do not routinely give intravenous antibiotics after a successful nonoperative reduction; we give antibiotics only if there are progressive symptoms and signs of sepsis, or if there is a suspicion of intestinal perforation despite successful nonoperative reduction. A low-grade fever (temperature higher than 38 to 39&ordm;C (100.4 to 102&ordm;F) is often noted during the first few hours after the procedure, probably because of the systemic inflammatory response associated with transient bowel ischemia. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diet &ndash; We offer clear fluids as soon as the patient is awake and alert, and advance the diet as tolerated. We place a nasogastric tube only if the patient has recurrent vomiting or clinical evidence of bowel obstruction. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Disposition &ndash; If patients are well-appearing and tolerating clear fluids within two hours after nonoperative reduction, we typically discharge the patient as long as they are able to return to the hospital promptly for recurrent symptoms.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">At many institutions it has been common practice to admit the patient for 12 to 24 hours of observation, primarily to monitor for early recurrence. The duration of the observation is guided by monitoring symptoms, vital signs, physical examination, the distance the family lives from the hospital, and tolerance of a diet. However, the utility of routine inpatient observation has been questioned because only about 4 percent of patients experience recurrence within 48 hours, and recurrence rates of intussusception do not differ between children observed in the hospital and those discharged home [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/107,108\" class=\"abstract_t\">107,108</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Imaging &ndash; No routine imaging is required for patients that remain asymptomatic. Should symptoms develop that are suspicious for recurrent intussusception, an ultrasound study is warranted. If there is concern for perforation, the patient should be evaluated with conventional radiographs. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Recurrence'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Consultations &ndash; We consult the pediatric surgical service promptly if there is suspected intestinal perforation or incomplete reduction of intussusception.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Follow-up &ndash; When the patient is discharged, we give instructions to call promptly if symptoms recur, and plans for follow-up by a clinician within one to two days.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h3\">Recurrence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intussusception recurs in approximately 10 percent of children after successful nonoperative reduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/107-109\" class=\"abstract_t\">107-109</a>]. About one-half of the recurrences are within the first 72 hours after nonoperative reduction (perhaps because of residual bowel edema or inflammation, which may act as a lead point), and the remainder occur weeks or months later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/107\" class=\"abstract_t\">107</a>]. </p><p>Management of recurrent intussusception depends upon the patient's individual characteristics. Recurrence is not necessarily an indication for surgery. In general, each recurrence should be handled as if it were the first episode, provided that each attempt at nonoperative reduction is successful and the patient remains stable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/110\" class=\"abstract_t\">110</a>]. However, imaging studies should be reviewed carefully for the possibility of a pathologic lead point. If a lead point is identified, the patient may still be treated with nonoperative reduction, particularly if the lead point is diffuse (eg, immunoglobulin A vasculitis [IgAV; Henoch-Sch&ouml;nlein purpura (HSP)]) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, surgical exploration should be performed for any patient who is unstable, and should also be considered for those with a focal lead point or multiple recurrences.</p><p>The risk for recurrence is associated with patient age older than one year, but not the duration of symptoms at the initial presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/111,112\" class=\"abstract_t\">111,112</a>]. The rate is similar for the different nonoperative techniques of reduction described above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/108,109\" class=\"abstract_t\">108,109</a>]. Multiple recurrences of intussusception are associated with the presence of a pathologic lead point, but may also occur in those with &quot;idiopathic&quot; intussusception. In one series, 19 percent of children with two or more episodes of intussusception had a pathologic lead point, whereas 4 percent of children without a recurrence had a pathologic lead point [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>Among children with idiopathic intussusception, lymphoid hyperplasia may act as a lead point. Because of this putative association, treatment with glucocorticoids has been suggested to prevent recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/113,114\" class=\"abstract_t\">113,114</a>]. However, this approach has not been sufficiently studied, so until further information is available we do not recommend routine use of glucocorticoids to prevent recurrences [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/115\" class=\"abstract_t\">115</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Indications for urgent surgical intervention include: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unstable patient &ndash; In this case, initiate resuscitation, consult surgeon, and stabilize the patient before proceeding to the operating room.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Peritonitis or intestinal perforation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nonoperative reduction is completely unsuccessful.

However, not all filling defects are indications for surgery: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the patient has undergone successful nonoperative reduction (as indicated by relief of symptoms) and there is a residual filling defect that is consistent with an edematous ileocecal valve, the patient can be safely observed.

(See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Recurrence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p>Children needing operative management require adequate intravenous fluid resuscitation and prophylactic intravenous antibiotics covering enteric flora prior to skin incision. Patients presenting with clinically significant nausea and emesis may require nasogastric tube decompression until their bowel obstruction resolves.</p><p>Contemporary operative management of childhood intussusception by pediatric surgeons uses a minimally invasive approach via laparoscopy in most cases. Laparoscopy allows for accurate diagnosis, as well as reduction of intussusception and, if necessary, bowel resection and anastomosis. Successful laparoscopic approaches to childhood intussusception have been demonstrated in several series worldwide to be safe, effective, and may be associated with a more rapid recovery of intestinal function with less need for postoperative narcotic analgesia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/116-120\" class=\"abstract_t\">116-120</a>].</p><p>Reduction of intussusception during operation is attempted in most cases, but resection with primary anastomosis is performed if manual reduction is not possible or if a pathologic lead point is seen. The risk of recurrence is approximately 1 percent after manual reduction and virtually nonexistent after surgical resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/121\" class=\"abstract_t\">121</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23\"><span class=\"h2\">Small bowel intussusception</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with intussusception limited to the small bowel are managed somewhat differently. Compared with ileocolic intussusception, small bowel intussusception is less likely to respond to nonoperative reduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/18,122,123\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,122,123</a>], and more likely to reduce spontaneously (provided that the intussusceptum is short).</p><p>Patients with small bowel intussusception are managed in one of two ways, depending on the clinical circumstances:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If a short ileo-ileal intussusception is detected incidentally on a radiographic procedure in an asymptomatic patient, the intussusception may resolve spontaneously, and the patient can be managed expectantly. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Asymptomatic intussusception'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the patient is symptomatic or if the intussusceptum is long, nonoperative reduction may be attempted, but is rarely successful. If nonoperative reduction is unsuccessful or is not attempted, surgery is often necessary.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24\"><span class=\"h2\">Asymptomatic intussusception</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intussusception that is detected incidentally by imaging in an asymptomatic patient often resolves spontaneously (termed spontaneous reduction of intussusception, SROI). These cases are increasingly recognized, probably because ultrasound is frequently used for diagnosis, and may detect transient intussusceptions. In one series, SROI was reported in 17 percent of cases, and about one-half of these were asymptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/124\" class=\"abstract_t\">124</a>]. These &quot;incidentally&quot; diagnosed (asymptomatic) cases of intussusception do not require attempts at either radiologic reduction or operative exploration. Instead, they should be managed with reassurance to the parents with a plan of judicious observation.</p><p>Intussusception is more likely to resolve spontaneously if it is limited to the small bowel (eg, ileo-ileal intussusception), and if the intussusceptum is short (&lt;2.3 cm in length) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. In one series of patients with isolated small bowel intussusception, all cases in which the intussusceptum was &lt;3.5 cm resolved spontaneously, and the children who required surgery had a mean intussusceptum length of 7.3 cm (95% CI 4.8-9.7 cm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/intussusception-in-children/abstract/125\" class=\"abstract_t\">125</a>].

It is the most common cause of intestinal obstruction in infants between 6 and 36 months of age. Ileocolic intussusception involves the ileocecal junction, and accounts for 90 percent of all cases. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2596268030\" class=\"local\">'Types and terminology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 75 percent of cases of intussusception are considered &quot;idiopathic,&quot; although some of these episodes may be triggered by viral infections. The remaining 25 percent of cases are caused by an underlying disease or condition that creates a pathologic lead point for the intussusception, most commonly a Meckel diverticulum. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intussusception typically presents with the sudden onset of intermittent, severe, crampy, progressive abdominal pain, sometimes with vomiting and grossly bloody stools, alternating with relatively pain-free periods. The classic triad of abdominal pain, palpable mass, and currant jelly stools is found in about 15 percent of cases. Initially, emesis is nonbilious, but it may become bilious as the obstruction progresses. As symptoms progress, lethargy often develops and may be profound. In a minority of cases, the initial presenting sign may be lethargy or altered consciousness alone, without apparent abdominal symptoms. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ultrasonography is the method of choice to detect intussusception. A &quot;bull's eye&quot; or &quot;coiled spring&quot; lesion is seen, representing layers of the intestine within the intestine (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F114377\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef114377 \">image 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Ultrasonography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For stable patients with evidence of intussusception by imaging (ultrasound or radiographs) and no evidence of bowel perforation, we recommend nonoperative reduction of the intussusception rather than surgery or observation (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=3\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1C</a>). The reduction can be guided by fluoroscopy or ultrasound, and either pneumatic or hydrostatic enemas may be used (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F114380\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef114380 \">image 6</a>). There is a slightly higher success rate with pneumatic reduction under fluoroscopy, but ultrasound-guided approaches may allow for better identification of pathologic lead points and lower exposure to radiation. The choice of technique depends primarily upon the expertise and comfort level of the radiologist. The rates of complications for either of these techniques are similar.

If the patient is stable, we suggest treating recurrences with repeated nonoperative reduction rather than surgery (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Patients with one or more recurrences are more likely to have pathologic lead points. (See <a href=\"#H21\" class=\"local\">'Recurrence'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgical treatment is indicated as a primary intervention for patients with suspected intussusception who are acutely ill or have evidence of perforation. Surgery also may be appropriate when the patient is treated in a location where the radiographic facilities and expertise to perform nonoperative reduction are not readily available. Surgery is necessary for patients in whom nonoperative reduction is unsuccessful, or for evaluation or resection of a focal pathologic lead point. The majority of patients may be safely and effectively treated with minimally invasive approaches.
