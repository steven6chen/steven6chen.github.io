The management of RHD and the epidemiology, pathogenesis, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of acute rheumatic fever are discussed separately.

The global mortality burden of RHD decreased by nearly 50 percent from 1990 to 2015, but the prevalence varied widely among countries and was highest in Oceania, central sub-Saharan Africa, and South Asia. Estimated age-standardized prevalence of RHD in 2015 was 3.4 cases per 100,000 population in nonendemic countries and 444 cases per 100,000 population in endemic countries. Twenty countries with an endemic pattern of RHD had an age-standardized prevalence exceeding 1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-heart-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>RHD is a disease affecting predominantly those living in poverty with inadequate access to health care and unchecked exposure to group A streptococcus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-heart-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The impact of socioeconomic status is illustrated by a study from Kinshasa where the prevalence based on clinical examination was 22.2 per 1000 among children who lived in slums but only 4 per 1000 among children attending the city schools [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-heart-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. A later report outlined the increased risk of RHD in association with overcrowding and unemployment as well as overcrowding and distance from the nearest health center [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-heart-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The importance of socioeconomic factors is further underscored by the virtual disappearance of RHD in industrialized countries since the mid-20<sup>th</sup> century, which started well before the introduction of penicillin. By contrast, RHD is still endemic in Africa, Asia, South America, and developing communities of Australasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-heart-disease/abstract/4,8-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,8-12</a>]. </p><p>Echocardiographic studies have revealed high prevalence rates in developing countries. A robust systematic review and meta-analysis calculated the prevalence of clinically silent RHD (21.1 per 1000 people, 95% CI 14.1-31.4) to be approximately seven to eight times higher than that of clinically manifest disease (2.7 per 1000 people, 95% CI 1.6-4.4), with prevalence increasing with age, from 4.7 per 1000 children (95% CI 0.0-11.2) 5 years of age to 21.0 per 1000 children (95% CI 6.8-35.1) 16 years of age; prevalence is positively associated with increasing Gini coefficient for social inequality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-heart-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Based on these data, it is estimated that the RHD burden could as much as double that in the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-heart-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Based upon the premise that children in sub-Saharan Africa represent 6 to 7 percent of total global RHD burden [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-heart-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], there may be an estimated 50 to 80 million persons currently affected with RHD worldwide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-heart-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p>RHD causes symptomatic valvular heart disease in children who are younger than five years of age in Africa and Asia, and the burden of disease rises with age. In South Africa, the incidence of HF due to RHD increases from 30 per 100,000 per year in the 14- to 19-year age group to over 53 per 100,000 per year in older adults, resulting in an average incidence of 23 per 100,000 per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-heart-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. These rates are in contrast to the incidence of rheumatic fever in developed countries of <span class=\"nowrap\">&lt;1/100,000</span> of the population per year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-heart-disease/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Longitudinal registries have shown that in low- and middle-income countries, patients present young with complications at diagnosis, advanced disease, and suffer significant morbidity and mortality. The multinational REMEDY study demonstrated clear gaps in evidence-based interventions in a young population (median age of 26) with a mortality of 16.9 percent within the 24-month observation period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-heart-disease/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>].</p><p>Of note, the selected echocardiographic criteria for diagnosis of RHD affect the rate of detection of disease. Echocardiographic criteria have evolved from World Health Organization criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-heart-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>] to definitions of definite and probable RHD identified by an expert consensus statement endorsed by the World Heart Federation criteria, as described below [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-heart-disease/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

RHD is defined as permanent heart valve damage subsequent to ARF.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16376507\"><span class=\"h2\">Rheumatic carditis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical features of ARF occur two to three weeks following a streptococcal throat infection, and the most common clinical manifestations are rheumatic carditis (30 to 80 percent of cases) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-heart-disease/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>] and arthritis (35 to 66 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-heart-disease/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. ARF causes pancarditis, affecting the pericardium (pericarditis), epicardium, myocardium (myocarditis, sometimes manifest as conduction system disease), and endocardium (valvulitis). Since valvulitis is generally a prominent manifestation of rheumatic carditis, a diagnosis of rheumatic carditis should be reevaluated if pericarditis, myocarditis, or conduction abnormality occurs in the absence of valvulitis.</p><p>Noncardiac clinical manifestations of ARF are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-rheumatic-fever-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute rheumatic fever: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The predominant manifestation of rheumatic carditis is endocardial involvement presenting clinically as valvulitis, particularly affecting the mitral and aortic valves [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-heart-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The clinical correlate of valvulitis is pathologic valvular regurgitation, which may be detected clinically (as regurgitant murmurs) or only on echocardiography. Mitral regurgitation (MR) may be detected as an apical holosystolic murmur and may or may not be accompanied by an apical mid-diastolic murmur (Carey-Coombs murmur) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> aortic regurgitation (AR; which may be detected as a basal early diastolic murmur). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=auscultation-of-cardiac-murmurs-in-adults#H2576070304\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Auscultation of cardiac murmurs in adults&quot;, section on 'Carey-Coombs murmur'</a>.)</p><p>Approximately 10 percent of patients with ARF develop severe acute valvulitis with mitral <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> aortic insufficiency after the first episode of ARF, with consequent symptoms including dyspnea and exercise intolerance. A proportion of these will need medical management and early intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-heart-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Rheumatic carditis detected only by echocardiography (as valve disease with valvular regurgitation) is termed subclinical carditis, which may constitute up to 53 percent of rheumatic carditis cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-heart-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p>MR is the most common early valvular manifestation and may be accompanied by AR <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> uncommonly by tricuspid regurgitation (TR); isolated AR is less common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-heart-disease/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. The mechanism of MR during ARF has been postulated to relate to a combination of annulitis with annular dilatation, chorditis with chordal elongation, and valvulitis resulting in typically anterior mitral leaflet prolapse and pathologic MR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-heart-disease/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Chordal rupture is a rare complication of rheumatic carditis, which in some cases may require emergency mitral valve (MV) repair. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-mitral-regurgitation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute mitral regurgitation in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Pericarditis occurs in approximately 15 percent of cases of ARF and may present with precordial chest pain and a pericardial friction rub [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-heart-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The pericarditis may be transient and generally resolves without sequelae. Cardiac tamponade has been reported only rarely in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-heart-disease/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-pericarditis-clinical-presentation-and-diagnostic-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute pericarditis: Clinical presentation and diagnostic evaluation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Heart failure (HF) and left ventricular (LV) dilation in patients with ARF are caused chiefly by severe valve disease (mainly MR with or without AR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-heart-disease/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. Although myocarditis is common in autopsy cases, the main cause of LV dilation and HF appears to be severe MR with or without AR, as suggested by prompt reduction in LV dimensions and preserved systolic function following valve surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-heart-disease/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>The electrocardiogram may demonstrate any degree of atrioventricular block, including third-degree block. Chest radiography may demonstrate cardiomegaly. (See <a href=\"#H2681618577\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis of rheumatic carditis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10512862\"><span class=\"h2\">Transition from acute to chronic disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Progressive valvular disease commonly develops in the years following one or more episodes of ARF, as illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective study of children with ARF followed for 2 to 15 years during the modern era in Brazil found that 72 percent of the 258 subjects developed chronic valvular disease, and 16 percent progressed to severe aortic <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> mitral disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-heart-disease/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Frequent development of chronic valvular disease was also observed in the largest prospective study of the natural history of ARF in the pre-antibiotic era (also prior to the development of echocardiography) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-heart-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Twenty-year follow-up by clinical examination of this North American series of 1000 children and adolescents yielded the following observations: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Sixty-five percent of patients had clinical evidence of valvular heart disease after recovery from the initial episode of rheumatic fever. By the end of 20 years of follow-up, clinical signs of rheumatic valvular disease had disappeared in 17 percent of these patients. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The remaining 35 percent of patients recovered from their initial attack without detectable valvular heart disease. However, by the end of 20 years of follow-up, 44 percent of these patients had overt signs of valvular heart disease. Pure mitral stenosis (MS) developed in 12 percent of patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In this pre-antibiotic series, the mortality rate following ARF was 1.5 percent per year, with recurrent rheumatic fever and HF together accounting for 80 percent of fatalities and bacterial endocarditis for an additional 10 percent. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23709418\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronic valve disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While chronic RHD occurs only as a sequel of ARF, the majority of patients with RHD lack a history of past ARF, suggesting that the diagnosis of ARF is frequently missed with the initial or recurrent insults being subclinical or not detected. RHD generally presents as valve disease, which may or may not be detected by a murmur. Some cases of RHD are detected as part of research screening programs. (See <a href=\"#H2961140902\" class=\"local\">'Screening in endemic settings'</a> below.)</p><p>The frequency of symptoms and signs of HF (eg, dyspnea and evidence of pulmonary edema) and of embolic events (eg, stroke) among patients with RHD varies depending upon the stage of valve disease at diagnosis. Contemporary data suggest that in endemic areas presentation with advanced disease is common, and thus complications such as HF (33 percent), atrial fibrillation (22 percent), pulmonary hypertension (29 percent), and less commonly cardio-embolic stroke (7 percent) are detected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-heart-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Patients with symptomatic chronic RHD face high rates of mortality (16.9 percent in two years) and morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-heart-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Morbidity relates to the development of complications such as new onset HF, atrial fibrillation, stroke, recurrent carditis, and infective endocarditis and is exacerbated by limited resource allocation to operate on such patients. </p><p>The MV is involved in nearly all cases of RHD, including those with other affected valves. The aortic valve is involved in approximately 20 to 30 percent of cases. The tricuspid valve is commonly affected, but tricuspid valve disease is frequently subclinical until surgery is required. Pulmonic valve involvement is rare. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24385710\"><span class=\"h3\">Disease course and relationship to age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence and pattern of MV pathology in RHD varies according to age (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F104279\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef104279 \">algorithm 1A</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-heart-disease/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. In the published literature of the current era, clinically detected RHD is most commonly diagnosed in individuals aged 20 to 50 years with nearly two-thirds of cases occurring in females. In endemic areas, the disease may progress more rapidly with children presenting with severe valvular lesions, whereas in developed countries, the progression of disease is more indolent and manifests at older ages (above 50 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-heart-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The multicenter REMEDY study provided insight into contemporary patterns and presentations of RHD, which differs in comparison with disease presentation in prior decades, such as the pre-antibiotic era during which isolated lesions were most common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-heart-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In the current era, isolated MR is the predominant lesion encountered in those under 20 years of age, MS develops from the third decade, and multivalvular disease (varying combinations of stenotic or regurgitant lesions involving the mitral and aortic valves) is the predominant abnormality in older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-heart-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The clinical presentation, hemodynamic consequences, and complications of these mixed valvular and multivalvular lesions require insightful clinical, echocardiographic, and occasionally invasive assessment. </p><p>Isolated MS is the most commonly encountered single valve lesion after the age of 30. Rheumatic aortic valve stenosis generally occurs in patients with concomitant or prior evidence of AR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-heart-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Rheumatic aortic stenosis (AS) generally develops over a period of decades, and pure rheumatic AS is rare under the age of 30. Concomitant bicuspid aortic valve has been suspected in some cases of early AS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-heart-disease/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], but early AS can occur with a trileaflet valve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-heart-disease/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. </p><p>In the above cited pre-antibiotic era series, a characteristic blowing diastolic murmur of AR was observed in 19 percent of children with a first episode of rheumatic fever, and subsequently developed in a similar proportion of untreated patients followed over time, such that a total of 38 percent developed AR over the course of 20 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-heart-disease/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Isolated AR was observed in only 3 percent of cases of rheumatic valve disease, with the remainder having coexistent MV disease. </p><p>Contemporary data on disease course in patients with RHD illustrate the risk of progression. A registry study of 591 Indigenous Australians aged 5 to 24 years diagnosed with RHD from 1999 to 2012 evaluated disease course and outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-heart-disease/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Among the 96 patients with severe RHD, 50 percent underwent valve surgery by two years, and 10 percent were dead within six years. Among the patients with moderate RHD, at 10 years, one-third had progressed to severe, one-third stayed the same, and one-third regressed to mild. Among patients with mild RHD, 64 percent remained mild after 10 years, but 11.4 percent progressed to severe RHD.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1874573985\"><span class=\"h3\">Disease course for specific valve lesions</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10512869\"><span class=\"h4\">Mitral stenosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The natural history of MS varies across geographic areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-heart-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In North America, for example, it is most commonly a slowly progressive disease, with a latency period as long as 20 to 40 years between the initial infection and the onset of clinical symptoms. In developing countries, on the other hand, MS progresses much more rapidly and may lead to symptoms in patients who are less than five years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-heart-disease/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. </p><p>Survival is greater than 80 percent at 10 years for patients who are asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic (New York Heart Association [NYHA] functional class I or II) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52683\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52683 \">table 1</a>) at time of diagnosis; 60 percent of such patients may not experience any progression of symptoms over this timeframe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-heart-disease/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Once limiting symptoms (NYHA functional class III or IV) develop, however, survival without intervention predictably worsens and has been estimated at 0 to 15 percent over the ensuing 10 years. Mean survival time falls to less than three years if severe pulmonary hypertension has intervened.

Of note, among the acquired heart valve lesions, MS is associated with the highest risk of systemic thromboembolism. The risk increases markedly following the onset of atrial fibrillation and is considerably higher for patients with MS compared with those with isolated MR. Patients who suffer a first embolus are at increased risk for repeat embolization, particularly over the ensuing six months.

Several observational studies suggest that subclinical valve lesions can progress to clinically evident disease, resolve with and without therapy, and remain stable after six months to over five years of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-heart-disease/abstract/9,40,44-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,40,44-48</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>RHD has an initial latent stage that is detectable by simple testing and is amenable to treatment that improves prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-heart-disease/abstract/8,9,49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9,49,50</a>]. There are large numbers of presymptomatic cases with typical auscultatory and echocardiographic abnormalities, and portable echocardiography is a sensitive tool for screening, though the specificity of minor echocardiographic findings is uncertain. It remains a concern that some minor valvular abnormalities are termed &quot;rheumatic&quot; when these may be a variant of normal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-heart-disease/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Secondary prophylaxis for clinical acute rheumatic fever (ARF) reduces recurrent rheumatic fever episodes and frequency and duration of hospitalization (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-rheumatic-fever-treatment-and-prevention#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute rheumatic fever: Treatment and prevention&quot;, section on 'Secondary prevention (antibiotic prophylaxis)'</a>). However, the effect of secondary prophylaxis on the course of subclinical RHD has not been established, although regression of lesions in the context of ARF has been demonstrated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-heart-disease/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition, the cost-effectiveness of screening for RHD is uncertain. The majority of reports looking at the cost-effectiveness have modeled virtual costs, although a later publication used multistate models and local data to review costs and concluded that screening could be cost-effective if RHD was diagnosed at least two years earlier [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-heart-disease/abstract/34,53\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,53</a>]. However, the areas in which RHD is endemic are highly variable, and thus it is difficult to weigh the costs and potential benefits of screening with other demands on health care resources in endemic areas.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H297034133\"><span class=\"h2\">Types of screening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Screening for RHD involves eliciting a history of ARF, clinical cardiac auscultation, and echocardiography in an asymptomatic individual with active surveillance (not an individual seeking care). Largely, screening programs have occurred at schools, although home-based, antenatal clinic and community-based screening programs have developed. An individual with a typical cardiac valvular abnormality with a history of ARF, regardless of severity, represents a definite case of RHD that requires antibiotics for secondary prevention of ARF (this should be defined as a missed case if detected during a screening program). A useful classification system for cases without a history of ARF that are identified by combined echocardiographic and clinical screening is shown in the following table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F66581\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66581 \">table 3</a>). </p><p>There are two screening approaches that have been applied to rheumatic valve disease in high-risk communities in individuals with or without a history of rheumatic fever: clinical cardiac auscultation followed by echocardiographic confirmation in patients with a significant murmur; or portable echocardiography for all, followed by clinical examination of abnormal cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-heart-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, cardiac auscultation has been shown to lack sensitivity and specificity for detection of valve pathology by echocardiography, leaving many subclinical cases of RHD undiagnosed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-heart-disease/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].<strong> </strong>Echocardiography offers greater sensitivity, thus screening using echocardiography has become the norm, with new programs focusing on screening with focused shorter protocols, utilizing handheld echocardiograms, and nonexpert sonographers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-rheumatic-heart-disease/abstract/55-59\" class=\"abstract_t\">55-59</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3008857887\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

(See <a href=\"#H7988558\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) causes a pancarditis, affecting the valve leaflets, pericardium, epicardium, myocardium, and endocardium. Mitral regurgitation (MR; with or without aortic regurgitation) is the most common valve lesion. The new Jones criteria incorporating epidemiology and Doppler echocardiography should be applied. (See <a href=\"#H16376507\" class=\"local\">'Rheumatic carditis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with suspected or confirmed ARF or a new murmur should undergo echocardiography to determine if valve abnormalities are present. The diagnosis of rheumatic carditis is confirmed by echocardiography showing both morphologic valvular involvement of mitral <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> aortic valves (except for very early cases with normal valve morphology) and Doppler evidence of pathologic valvular regurgitation. (See <a href=\"#H3671887655\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis of rheumatic carditis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>While RHD occurs only as a sequela of ARF, the majority of patients with RHD lack a history of past ARF, suggesting that the diagnosis of ARF is frequently missed. (See <a href=\"#H23709418\" class=\"local\">'Chronic valve disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The incidence and pattern of mitral valve (MV) pathology in RHD varies according to age and geography. In general, younger patients under the age of 30 present predominantly with isolated MR, whereas middle-aged adult patients develop mitral stenosis from the third decade, with mixed MV disease becoming more dominant in older patients. (See <a href=\"#H24385710\" class=\"local\">'Disease course and relationship to age'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>RHD should be suspected in patients with past history of ARF <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> suspected pathologic cardiac murmur. The diagnosis is confirmed by the presence of echocardiographic morphologic and Doppler criteria. (See <a href=\"#H1501544531\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis of rheumatic heart disease'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Echocardiographic screening programs for RHD should be confined to research, as RHD meets some, but not all, criteria for screening.
