These labor abnormalities are best described as protraction disorders (ie, slower than normal progress) or arrest disorders (ie, complete cessation of progress). By convention, an abnormally long active phase is usually described as protracted, whereas an abnormally long latent phase or second stage is usually described as prolonged.</p><p>This topic will describe normal labor progress and discuss the diagnosis and management of protraction and arrest disorders. Management of normal labor and delivery is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-normal-labor-and-delivery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of normal labor and delivery&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">NORMAL LABOR PROGRESSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although determining whether labor is progressing normally is a key component of intrapartum care, determining the onset of labor, measuring its progress, and evaluating the factors (power, passenger, pelvis) that affect its course are an inexact science.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30701237\"><span class=\"h2\">Stages and phases</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Interpretation of labor progress depends on the stage and phase. The three stages and their phases are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>First stage</strong> &ndash; Time from onset of labor to complete cervical dilation. Clinically, women are simply asked the time when they believe labor began (ie, when contractions started to occur regularly every 3 to 5 minutes for more than an hour) to document the onset of labor. The time that complete dilation is first identified on physical examination documents the end of the first stage. The precise times of both the start of labor and of complete dilatation are impossible to determine since the normal uterus contracts intermittently and irregularly throughout gestation, the initial regular contractions at the onset of labor are mild and infrequent, initial cervical changes are subtle, and physical examination to document cervical change is performed intermittently.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The first stage consists of a <strong>latent phase </strong>and an <strong>active phase</strong>. The latent phase is characterized by gradual cervical change and the active phase is characterized by rapid cervical change. The labor curve of multiparas may show an inflection point between the latent and active phases; this point occurs at about 5 cm dilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-and-abnormal-labor-progression/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In nulliparas, the inflection point is often unclear and, if present, occurs at a more advanced cervical dilation typically at approximately 6 cm or more. In any case, this inflection point is a retrospective finding.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Second stage</strong> &ndash; Time from complete cervical dilation to fetal expulsion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">When pushing is delayed, some clinicians divide the second stage into a <strong>passive phase</strong> (from complete cervical dilation to onset of active maternal expulsive efforts) and an <strong>active phase</strong> (from beginning of active maternal expulsive efforts to expulsion of the fetus) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-and-abnormal-labor-progression/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Third stage</strong> &ndash; Time between fetal expulsion and placental expulsion.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12634785\"><span class=\"h2\">Criteria for normal progress</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Emanuel Friedman established criteria for the normal progress of labor in the 1950s, and these criteria were used for assessment and management of labor for decades. However, data derived from women in labor in the 21<sup>st</sup> century suggest that changes in obstetric and anesthesia practices and in women themselves in recent decades have resulted in changes in the average progress of labor. Therefore, criteria for normal labor progress have been revised, although this remains controversial.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30701004\"><span class=\"h3\">Friedman (historic) criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Emanuel Friedman conducted his now classic studies defining the spectrum of normal labor by evaluating the course of labor of 500 primigravidas admitted to the Sloane Hospital for Women in New York in the mid-1950s [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-and-abnormal-labor-progression/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. The norms established by his data, depicted as the &quot;Friedman curve&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F53413\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53413 \">figure 1</a>), were widely accepted as the standard for assessment of normal labor progression for decades.</p><p>Based on these data, the transition from the latent phase to active phase appeared to occur at 3 to 4 cm cervical dilation, and the statistical minimum rate (5<sup>th</sup> centile) of normal cervical dilation during the active phase was 1.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/hour</span> for nulliparous women and 1.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/hour</span> for multiparous women.</p><p>A prolonged second stage for nulliparas and multiparas was defined as three hours and one hour, respectively.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30701062\"><span class=\"h3\">Contemporary criteria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The applicability of the Friedman curve and its established norms to contemporary obstetric practice was challenged in the 21<sup>st</sup> century. Several studies evaluated labor curves in thousands of contemporary women to establish contemporary criteria for normal labor progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-and-abnormal-labor-progression/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. These criteria are different from, and generally slower than, those cited by Friedman. This change has been attributed to changes in patient characteristics (eg, higher mean body mass index), anesthesia practices (more use of neuraxial anesthesia), and obstetric practices over the past half-century. In addition, a limitation of Friedman's findings is that his data were based on labors in only 500 women who were managed at a single institution. However, revision of the classic labor curve as described by Friedman has not been accepted universally. For example, Friedman and Cohen argue that the shape of the curve may have been influenced by selection biases and confounders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-and-abnormal-labor-progression/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. The most appropriate statistical methods remain debated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7768792\"><span class=\"h4\">First stage</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Progress</strong> -- Zhang and colleagues obtained data on normal labor patterns by evaluating contemporary data from the Consortium on Safe Labor, which included information on 62,415 singleton pregnancies with spontaneous onset of labor, cephalic vaginal delivery (&ge;88 percent spontaneous), and normal neonatal outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-and-abnormal-labor-progression/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The data were collected retrospectively from the electronic medical records at 19 medical centers in the United States. These data have been used to define normal labor progress, as shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F69170\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69170 \">table 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The shape of the normal labor curve generated from Zhang's data (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F89190\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef89190 \">figure 2</a>) is different from the Friedman curve (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F53413\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53413 \">figure 1</a>). The Friedman curve depicts a relatively slow rate of cervical dilation until approximately 4 cm (ie, latent phase), which is followed by an abrupt acceleration in the rate of dilation (ie, active phase) until entering a deceleration phase at approximately 9 cm. Zhang's labor curves also demonstrate an increase in the rate of cervical dilation as labor progresses, but the increase is more gradual than that described by Friedman: Over 50 percent of patients did not dilate &gt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/hour</span> until reaching 5 to 6 cm dilation, and a deceleration phase at the end of the first stage of labor was not observed. Labor curves constructed from other contemporary data sets also generally differ from Friedman's curve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-and-abnormal-labor-progression/abstract/7,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,11</a>]. Specifically, there is no abrupt change in the rate of cervical dilation indicating a clear transition from latent to active phase and there is no deceleration phase at the end of the first stage of labor.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">While the presence or absence of a deceleration phase at the end of the 1<sup>st</sup> stage of labor is not of major clinical significance, defining the transition from latent to active phase (ie, transition from slower to more rapid cervical dilation) is clinically important for diagnosing labor abnormalities. Contemporary data suggest that the normal rate of cervical change between 3 and 6 cm dilation is much slower than described by Friedman, who reported minimum dilation should be at least 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/hour</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-and-abnormal-labor-progression/abstract/7,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,12</a>]. Many contemporary women who go on to deliver vaginally have rates of cervical dilation &lt;1 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/hour</span> before reaching 6 cm dilation. Indeed, both nulliparas and multiparas who go on to deliver vaginally can take more than six hours to dilate from 4 cm to 5 cm and more than three hours to dilate from 5 cm to 6 cm (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F69170\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69170 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-and-abnormal-labor-progression/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Beyond 6 cm dilation, rates of cervical dilation are more rapid in both nulliparas and multiparas. This suggests that before 6 cm, slow cervical dilation reflects the shallow slope of the latent phase portion of the contemporary normal labor curve, not a protracted active phase. At &ge;6 cm dilation, nearly all women should be in active labor, so slow cervical dilation beyond this point (ie, less than about 1 to 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">cm/hour)</span> is a deviation from the slope of the contemporary normal labor curve and is abnormal if it persists.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Duration</strong> -- These contemporary observations about hourly labor progress translate into a longer normal duration of the first stage than described by Friedman [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-and-abnormal-labor-progression/abstract/11,13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,13-16</a>]. Zhang observed that the median (95<sup>th</sup> percentile) times for the cervix to dilate from 4 to 10 cm in nulliparas and multiparas were 5.3 hours (16.4) and 3.8 hours (15.7), respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-and-abnormal-labor-progression/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In contrast, Friedman reported the corresponding mean (95<sup>th</sup> percentile) durations in nulliparous and parous women were 4.6 hours (11.7) and 2.4 hours (5.2), respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-and-abnormal-labor-progression/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The contemporary increase in first-stage duration persists after adjustments are made for maternal and pregnancy characteristics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-and-abnormal-labor-progression/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], suggesting that changes in labor practice patterns may be the primary reason for the increase. Although epidural use has increased dramatically since the 1960s, increased use of epidurals does not fully account for the difference. Further study is required to explain these findings.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h4\">Second stage</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Descent</strong> -- At full cervical dilation, fetal station is typically &ge;0. In nulliparous women in the second stage, Zhang found that the median (95<sup>th</sup> percentile) time interval for fetal descent from station <span class=\"nowrap\">+1/3</span> to <span class=\"nowrap\">+2/3</span> was 16 minutes (three hours) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-and-abnormal-labor-progression/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].

Without epidural anesthesia, the median (95<sup>th</sup> percentile) was 0.6 hours (2.8) and 0.2 hours (1.3), respectively (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F69170\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69170 \">table 1</a>). Thus, epidural anesthesia increased the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile for the second stage by 0.8 hours in nulliparous women and 0.7 hours in parous women compared with no epidural anesthesia.

The partogram is a graphical representation of the patient's cervical dilation over time in comparison with the expected lower limit of normal progress. The following partogram is based on cervical dilation at admission and shows the minimum rate of labor progress achieved by 95 percent of nulliparous women with singleton term pregnancies and spontaneous onset of labor who had a vaginal delivery and normal neonatal outcomes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F89191\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef89191 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-and-abnormal-labor-progression/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Right deviation from this curve suggests a protraction or arrest disorder. Although useful for visualizing labor progress, use of partograms has not been proven to significantly improve obstetric outcome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-and-abnormal-labor-progression/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1234971950\"><span class=\"h2\">Ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although not widely used clinically, intrapartum transperineal ultrasound examination can document fetal descent and rotation in the second stage when performed serially, and assess the presence and extent of caput [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/normal-and-abnormal-labor-progression/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].
