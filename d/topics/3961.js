Pistol-shot sounds may be auscultated over the femoral arteries (Traube&rsquo;s sign), subungual capillary pulsations (Quincke&rsquo;s pulse) may be seen, and a systolic bruit may be heard over the carotid arteries.

In some cases, HF may be the presenting symptom of an occult cause of a high-output state (such as an arteriovenous fistula). Clinical manifestations of these disorders are discussed in separate topic reviews for these conditions. Clinical manifestations of some key causes are summarized here.

Infantile hepatic hemangiomas most commonly occur in the presence of multiple skin hemangiomas; multifocal hepatic hemangiomas may cause HF. Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (also called Osler-Weber-Rendu syndrome) is associated with epistaxis, gastrointestinal bleeding, and mucocutaneous telangiectasia.

Other physical exam findings of hyperthyroidism include stare, lid lag, proptosis, and fine tremor of the outstretched hands. The skin may be moist and warm as a result of cutaneous vasodilation; blood flow to the skin in hyperthyroid patients can be increased three times or greater than that in euthyroid controls due to enhanced endothelium-dependent vasodilation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-high-output-heart-failure/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Among individuals with hyperthyroidism, the thyroid examination varies according to the cause (ranging from nonpalpable to enlarged; a palpable nodule may or may not be present).

Such patients may present with unexplained HF or unexplained atrial fibrillation (AF). Clues to thyrotoxicosis in older patients include anxiety and emotional lability in the presence of a widened pulse pressure and either AF or unexplained sinus tachycardia. Tachycardia is commonly absent in older patients due to the presence of coexistent conduction system disease.

Beriberi has also been reported in patients with HF on prolonged diuretic regimens, although the frequency of significant thiamine deficiency in this population is uncertain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-high-output-heart-failure/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The combination of thiamine deficiency with chronic alcoholism may result in the concomitant presence of alcoholic cardiomyopathy and depression in LV systolic function due to thiamine deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-high-output-heart-failure/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

Beriberi disease in adults is classically divided into two types: a &quot;dry&quot; form (which may present with a burning sensation in the extremities, weakness, and falls associated with symmetrical peripheral neuropathies with both sensory and motor components) and a &quot;wet&quot; form (which may present with tachycardia, dyspnea, and peripheral edema associated with cardiomyopathy and high-output HF). Painful glossitis may be caused by thiamine deficiency. Anemia may be present if there is concomitant iron <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> folate deficiency. Wernicke encephalopathy is rarely accompanied by overt beriberi heart disease but may be accompanied by some signs of a high-output state.

Slow development of chronic anemia is well tolerated and frequently overlooked for some time. While mild anemia is common among patients with high-output HF (eg, related to hemodilution or chronic kidney disease), only profound anemia (eg, prolonged reduction in hemoglobin to approximately 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span> is likely to be the cause of high-output HF.

COPD typically presents with dyspnea, chronic cough, and sputum production, often with a history of cigarette smoking. Other symptoms and signs are discussed separately [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-high-output-heart-failure/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].

In a study of 120 patients with high-output HF, the mean N-terminal pro B-type natriuretic peptide level was 734 (range 327 to 2253) compared with a mean level of 76 (38 to 228) in controls without HF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-high-output-heart-failure/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identifying hemodynamic parameters of a high-output state. As noted above, the physical examination may suggest peripheral vasodilation. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We recommend obtaining a comprehensive echocardiogram (ie, with assessment of left ventricular ejection fraction [LVEF] and cardiac output). The presence of one or more of the following echocardiographic findings is suggestive of high-output HF: dilation of the inferior vena cava, right ventricular enlargement or dysfunction, elevation in estimated pulmonary artery pressures, or LV enlargement. Of note, LVEF can be normal or reduced in patients with high-output HF. Cardiac output may be estimated by echocardiography. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tests-to-evaluate-left-ventricular-systolic-function\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tests to evaluate left ventricular systolic function&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">For patients with new or worsening HF with supportive findings on echocardiography, we generally suggest invasive evaluation of cardiac hemodynamics by right heart catheterization. This allows for definitive assessment of volume status, and direct determination of cardiac output and pulmonary artery pressures. Echocardiography is sufficient for diagnosis only for selected cases with high-quality echocardiographic evidence of high cardiac index (CI).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">We assess cardiac output indexed for body surface area (CI) but do not use a strict threshold CI to identify a high-output state (such as resting CI &ge;4 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min/m<sup>2</sup>)</span>. High-output HF has traditionally been defined as symptoms in the setting of a cardiac output greater than 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span> or a CI greater than 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min/m<sup>2</sup></span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-management-of-high-output-heart-failure/abstract/1,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,14</a>]; however, this is not an absolute threshold since a CI that one patient may tolerate without problems may be excessive for another having decreased cardiac reserve. Clinical judgment is required in diagnosing high-output HF in patients with elevated CI on cardiac catheterization. Some patients may have a transient high-output state (eg, due to anxiety or pain) that may not be the cause of HF. (See <a href=\"#H1687947530\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Since increased cardiac output is physiologic during pregnancy, the presence of high-output HF in a pregnant woman should prompt evaluation for other causes of heart disease.
