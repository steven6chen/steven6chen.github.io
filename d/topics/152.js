The esophagus is the tube that moves food from the mouth to the stomach (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F55616\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55616 \">figure 1</a>). At the lower end of the esophagus, where it connects to the stomach, there is a muscle called the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). When the LES tightens, food can't move from the esophagus into the stomach. When the LES relaxes, food can move from the esophagus into the stomach.</p><p>When people have achalasia:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The lower part of the esophagus does not work normally</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The LES doesn't relax, so food can't move into the stomach</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11258724\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of achalasia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common symptom of achalasia is trouble swallowing foods and drinks. Other symptoms can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vomiting</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heartburn</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling like you have a lump in your throat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Losing weight without trying</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11258731\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there a test for achalasia?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If your doctor or nurse suspects that you have achalasia, he or she will do 1 or more of the following tests:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Measuring the pressure in your esophagus and LES &ndash; Your doctor will put a thin tube into your mouth or nose and down into the esophagus. The tube will measure the pressure there. This test can tell your doctor for sure if you have achalasia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=barium-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Barium</a> swallow &ndash; Your doctor will give you a drink called &quot;barium.&quot; Then he or she will take an X-ray as the barium moves down your esophagus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F69107\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69107 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A procedure called an upper endoscopy &ndash; Your doctor will put a thin tube with a camera on the end into your mouth and down into your esophagus and stomach (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F75392\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75392 \">figure 3</a>). He or she will look at the lining of the esophagus and stomach. He or she might also take a small sample of tissue from the lining and look at the sample under a microscope.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11258738\"><span class=\"h1\">How is achalasia treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Doctors can treat achalasia in different ways. Treatments cannot cure achalasia, but they can improve symptoms. The different treatments include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines &ndash; Different medicines can relax the LES. People can take these medicines before they eat.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A shot of medicine into the LES &ndash; During an upper endoscopy, a doctor can give a shot of medicine into the LES to make it relax.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Making the LES wider &ndash; During an upper endoscopy, a doctor can use a thin wire to put a special balloon through a person's mouth and down into the esophagus. The balloon is deflated until it reaches the LES. The doctor puts air into the balloon to widen the LES. Then he or she lets the air out of the balloon and removes it and the wire.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery &ndash; A doctor can cut open the LES to make it wider. This can be done by making small cuts in the belly or chest, or during an upper endoscopy without cutting through the skin at all. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11258745\"><span class=\"h1\">Which treatment is right for me?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To choose the treatment that's right for you, talk with your doctor. Ask him or her about the benefits, risks, and side effects of each treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11258752\"><span class=\"h1\">Do I need to follow up with my doctor?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. You will need to follow up with your doctor on a regular basis. He or she will check that your treatment is working and that it isn't causing side effects.</p><p>Your doctor will also keep checking you for long-term problems. That's because people with achalasia have a higher than normal chance of getting cancer or other problems of the esophagus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11258889\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=upper-endoscopy-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Upper endoscopy (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acid-reflux-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Acid reflux (gastroesophageal reflux disease) in adults (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=achalasia-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Achalasia (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=upper-endoscopy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Upper endoscopy (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acid-reflux-gastroesophageal-reflux-disease-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Acid reflux (gastroesophageal reflux disease) in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
