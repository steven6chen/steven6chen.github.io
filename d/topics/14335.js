It has clinicopathologic features that are distinct from systemic diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and shares some clinical and biologic features with classical nodular sclerosing Hodgkin lymphoma (HL).</p><p>This topic will discuss the clinical presentation, pathologic features, diagnosis, and treatment of PMBL. The diagnosis and treatment of systemic DLBCL and HL are presented separately.

There is a female predominance and a median age at diagnosis in the third to fourth decade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-mediastinal-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL PRESENTATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2430347\"><span class=\"h2\">Oncologic emergencies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients present with a locally invasive anterior mediastinal mass originating in the thymus, with frequent airway compromise and superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F77617\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef77617 \">image 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F59806\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef59806 \">image 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-mediastinal-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In one report of 30 patients, for example, SVC syndrome was present in 57 percent at presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-mediastinal-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In addition, other patients without clinical SVC obstruction had evidence of compression of this vessel by computed tomography (CT) scan; in total, 80 percent had some evidence of SVC compromise. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=malignancy-related-superior-vena-cava-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Malignancy-related superior vena cava syndrome&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-of-mediastinal-tumors\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology of mediastinal tumors&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Prompt recognition and management of SVC syndrome is <strong>critical</strong>. The clinical diagnosis of SVC syndrome is made on the basis of characteristic signs and symptoms of central venous obstruction. Dyspnea is the most common symptom. In addition, patients frequently complain of facial swelling or head fullness, which may be exacerbated by bending forward or lying down. Other symptoms include arm swelling, cough, chest pain, or dysphagia. Patients with cerebral edema may have headaches, confusion, or possibly coma. The diagnosis and management of malignancy-related SVC syndrome is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=malignancy-related-superior-vena-cava-syndrome#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Malignancy-related superior vena cava syndrome&quot;, section on 'Clinical manifestations and diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>Management of patients with SVC syndrome can be challenging, as intubation is difficult given the high pressures needed to maintain the airway. Although commonplace in the past, emergency radiation is no longer considered necessary for most patients. Radiation prior to biopsy may obscure the histologic diagnosis and may compromise the safe delivery of necessary chemotherapy by injuring the bone marrow in the sternum, ribs, and spine. Current management guidelines stress the importance of accurate histologic diagnosis prior to starting therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=malignancy-related-superior-vena-cava-syndrome#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Malignancy-related superior vena cava syndrome&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p>Other potential oncologic emergencies include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute airway obstruction </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pericardial tamponade</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperuricemia and tumor lysis syndrome</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thrombosis of major neck or superior thoracic veins</p><p/><p>Patients with large mediastinal masses are at increased risk of respiratory or cardiac arrest during general anesthesia or heavy sedation. Patients who present with cardiorespiratory symptoms or radiographic evidence of tracheal obstruction are at greatest risk of perioperative respiratory morbidity. </p><p>Although it is uncommon in primary mediastinal large B cell lymphoma (PMBL), tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is an oncologic emergency caused by massive tumor cell lysis and the release of large amounts of potassium, phosphate, and uric acid into the systemic circulation. Deposition of uric acid <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> calcium phosphate crystals in the renal tubules can result in acute renal failure, which is usually anuric.

Other structures that are sometimes involved by direct extension include the lungs, pleura, and pericardium. Up to half of patients may have a pleural or pericardial effusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-mediastinal-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].

The tumor is comprised of large cells with variable nuclear features, resembling centroblasts, large centrocytes, or multilobated cells, often with pale or &quot;clear&quot; cytoplasm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-mediastinal-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Less frequently, the tumor cells resemble immunoblasts. Reed-Sternberg-like cells may be present. Many cases have fine, compartmentalizing sclerosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F53317\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53317 \">picture 1</a>). Further details on the morphology of centrocytes, centroblasts, and immunoblasts are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of diffuse large B cell lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Morphology'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Immunophenotype</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The immunophenotype of PMBL can be confirmed by histochemistry or flow cytometry. The tumor cells express B cell-associated antigens (CD19, CD20, CD22, CD79a) and CD45 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-mediastinal-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], and are negative for CD5 and CD10. Weak expression of CD30 is often present. The tumor cells also stain for TRAF-1 and nuclear c-Rel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-mediastinal-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. These two markers are also commonly expressed by the Reed-Sternberg cells of classical Hodgkin lymphoma, but are uncommonly present in other forms of diffuse large B cell lymphoma. Other markers that are relatively specific for PMBL are CD200 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-mediastinal-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>] and MAL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-mediastinal-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Unlike most B cell tumors (but like classical Hodgkin lymphoma Reed-Sternberg cells), the tumors typically do not express immunoglobulins.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no single cytogenetic change that is typical or diagnostic of PMBL, although translocations involving the CIITA gene have been found in up to approximately 40 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-mediastinal-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Immunoglobulin heavy and light chain genes are rearranged. The B cell <span class=\"nowrap\">leukemia/lymphoma</span> 2 (BCL-2) gene is usually in the germline configuration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-mediastinal-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/10,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,16,17</a>] and B cell leukemia 6 (BCL-6) gene rearrangements are uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-mediastinal-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Amplification of the REL oncogene has been described in a minority of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-mediastinal-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Hyperdiploid karyotypes, often with gains in the region on chromosome 9p containing the JAK2 gene and the genes encoding PD-L1 and PD-L2, ligands for the receptor PD-1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-mediastinal-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], which has a role in suppressing T cell function, have been noted. Gene expression profiling has shown a similarity between the cell lines of primary mediastinal large B cell lymphoma and classical Hodgkin lymphoma, a disorder with which it shares a number of clinical and laboratory features [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-mediastinal-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of primary mediastinal large B cell lymphoma (PMBL) is made based upon pathologic evaluation of tumor tissue in the context of the clinical situation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Obtaining tissue</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>One of the most difficult problems in the diagnosis of PMBL can be obtaining an adequate biopsy specimen. Due to the location of the tumor, an excisional tissue biopsy is usually not possible. Small biopsies may be non-diagnostic because the lesion is not sampled adequately or because crush artifact or extensive necrosis, fibrosis, or cystic change obscures the diagnostic lesion. Due to fibrosis (which is often extensive), needle aspirates are often paucicellular and do not provide sufficient numbers of well-preserved tumor cells to establish the diagnosis. Similarly, core biopsies often contain only fibrotic tissue or tumor cells that are disrupted and not diagnostically useful. Because of these potential confounding factors, a surgical biopsy is preferred. As a rule, the diagnostic biopsy should consist of the largest tissue sample that can be easily and safely acquired. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-adult-patient-with-a-mediastinal-mass\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the adult patient with a mediastinal mass&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Urgent surgery may be required to obtain adequate tissue in patients with oncologic emergencies. The most common methods used for surgical biopsy of the mediastinum include cervical mediastinoscopy, anterior mediastinotomy, or thoracoscopy, depending upon the location of the lesion. Intraoperative frozen sections are often used to determine if diagnostic tissue has been obtained. However, frozen section processing introduces artifacts, and additional tissue should also be obtained that is not subjected to frozen sectioning. A sample of tumor also may be set aside to be snap frozen for molecular analyses.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Further evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Further evaluation of the patient with suspected PMBL includes imaging with a positron emission <span class=\"nowrap\">tomography/computed</span> tomography <span class=\"nowrap\">(PET/CT)</span> scan or CT scan, and a bone marrow biopsy. Patients with involvement of the bone marrow or distant lymph nodes likely have systemic lymphoma with secondary mediastinal involvement, rather than PMBL. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Systemic lymphoma with secondary mediastinal involvement'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Making the diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of PMBL is based on an evaluation of the tumor morphology and immunophenotyping interpreted in the context of the clinical presentation. As mentioned above, patients with PMBL may have locally extensive disease in the mediastinum, but usually do not have evidence of distant spread at initial presentation. Staining for pan-B cell markers, such as CD20 and CD79a, is sufficient to establish the diagnosis in many cases; additional stains for CD30, nuclear Rel, TRAF-1, MAL, and CD200 can be helpful in cases with atypical features.</p><p>As described in more detail above, the tumor is comprised of large cells with variable nuclear features, resembling centroblasts, large centrocytes, or multilobated cells, often with fine, compartmentalizing sclerosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F53317\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef53317 \">picture 1</a>). The tumor cells express pan-B cell markers and are usually positive for CD30 (weak), TRAF-1, nuclear c-Rel, MAL, and CD200. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The differential diagnosis of primary mediastinal large B cell lymphoma (PMBL) includes benign and malignant mediastinal tumors and, less commonly, infectious and inflammatory entities that may present with mediastinal involvement (eg, histoplasmosis and Castleman disease). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Systemic lymphoma with secondary mediastinal involvement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systemic diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) may secondarily involve the mediastinum and may be confused with PMBL. Systemic disease is usually confirmed on imaging studies <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> bone marrow biopsy. At diagnosis, PMBL may have spread to supraclavicular and cervical lymph nodes, and late in its course it has a curious propensity to involve viscera (eg, the kidney) and the central nervous system. However, if there is evidence of tumor in the bone marrow or involvement of more distant lymph nodes, the more likely diagnosis is systemic DLBCL with secondary mediastinal involvement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-mediastinal-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Immunohistochemistry can also help distinguish between systemic DLBCL and PMBL. Unlike systemic DLBCL, PMBLs typically express CD30 (weak), TRAF-1, nuclear c-Rel, CD200, and MAL. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, pathologic features, and diagnosis of diffuse large B cell lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Hodgkin lymphoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) and PMBL share many clinical and pathologic features. They are both more common in young women and present with a large mediastinal mass. On biopsy, PMBL may have cells that resemble the neoplastic Reed-Sternberg cells of HL. In addition, gene expression profiling has shown a similarity between the two entities.</p><p>Immunophenotype can help to distinguish PMBL from HL in most cases. In classical HL, the neoplastic Reed-Sternberg cells typically express CD15 (85 percent of cases) and high levels of CD30 (&gt;95 percent of cases), and lack pan-B and pan-T cell antigens. In contrast, PMBL cells typically express pan-B cell antigens, have weak expression of CD30, and only rarely express CD15. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-pathologic-features-and-diagnosis-of-classical-hodgkin-lymphoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology, pathologic features, and diagnosis of classical Hodgkin lymphoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There are occasional cases that combine features of PMBL and classical HL, which likely reflect the pathogenic commonalities between these two entities. Such cases are often referred to as &quot;gray-zone&quot; lymphomas and are labeled &quot;B cell lymphoma, unclassifiable, with features intermediate between DLBCL and classical Hodgkin lymphoma&quot; in the World Health Organization classification system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-mediastinal-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10977629\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2951634\"><span class=\"h2\">Pretreatment evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prior to initiating therapy, a pretreatment evaluation must establish the extent and sites of disease, and the performance status of the patient. The pretreatment evaluation for patients with primary mediastinal large B cell lymphoma (PMBL) is the same as that of patients with diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). This is discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-treatment-of-advanced-stage-diffuse-large-b-cell-lymphoma#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial treatment of advanced stage diffuse large B cell lymphoma&quot;, section on 'Pretreatment evaluation'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2951660\"><span class=\"h2\">Initial therapy</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25445804\"><span class=\"h3\">Choice of therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal treatment of PMBL is unknown and there is variation in clinical practice. Whenever possible, young, otherwise healthy patients should be encouraged to enroll onto a clinical trial. Outside of a clinical trial, choice of treatment options largely depends on patient and tumor characteristics and clinician comfort. (See <a href=\"#H2951679\" class=\"local\">'Clinical trials'</a> below.)</p><p>Frequent involvement of the chest wall and the presence of pleural and pericardial effusions make staging challenging (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F97479\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97479 \">table 1</a>). Patients with PMBL can be generally classified for management purposes as having either limited stage or advanced stage disease. Limited stage disease can be contained within one irradiation field.

Potential long-term toxicities from radiation therapy (RT) to the mediastinum include hypothyroidism, accelerated atherosclerotic heart disease, and lung and breast cancer. As such, clinicians are interested in minimizing the dose and field of radiation (eg, involved site radiation) and in identifying populations that can be successfully treated without RT. Outside of clinical trials, the use of RT in the initial treatment of PMBL is controversial and depends largely upon the choice of induction chemoimmunotherapy and on whether disease is present outside of the chest. (See <a href=\"#H25445804\" class=\"local\">'Choice of therapy'</a> above.)</p><p>RT is commonly employed for patients with limited stage disease after treatment with R-CHOP. In contrast, RT may be omitted following initial treatment with da-EPOCH-R. The use of positron emission tomography (PET) imaging to determine the need for RT is experimental.</p><p>Residual metabolic activity following initial therapy is associated with worse outcomes. In an international prospective study (IELSG-26), central evaluation of post-induction PET scans of 115 patients with limited stage PMBL treated with an anthracycline-based chemoimmunotherapy regimen identified 54 PET-negative scans (Deauville 1) and 27 scans with residual uptake higher than the mediastinal blood pool but lower than the liver (Deauville 2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-mediastinal-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

In a retrospective analysis of 96 patients with limited stage PMBL treated with R-CHOP, 46 were treated prior to 2005 when RT was administered routinely, and 50 were treated subsequently when RT was reserved for patients with positive post-treatment PET scans and those with negative PET scans were observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/primary-mediastinal-large-b-cell-lymphoma/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].
