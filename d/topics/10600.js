It depends on many factors, including the size of your baby and the way he or she is positioned in your uterus. The pain is usually mild early on in labor, but gets worse as you get closer to delivery.</p><p>Pain can come both from contractions (when the uterus tightens) and, later, from your vagina stretching as you push your baby out.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H301685723\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I make a plan to manage my pain?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Talk with your doctor, nurse, or midwife toward the end of pregnancy about how you can manage pain during labor and delivery. There are many ways to manage pain, and no one way works for everyone. The right decision is the one that is best for you.</p><p>Although it's helpful to make a plan before you go into labor, keep in mind that your plan can change. That's because your labor can be more or less painful than you expect.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H301685730\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the different ways I can manage my pain?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In general, you can manage your pain with:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Things you can do on your own</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H301685737\"><span class=\"h1\">What can I do on my own to manage my pain?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To help lessen your pain, you can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Change your body position</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do relaxation or breathing exercises</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take a shower or bath</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have someone massage your lower back</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Put heat or cold on your lower back</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Listen to music</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Take a walk</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have a &quot;doula&quot; help you &ndash; A doula is a person who stays with you during labor and delivery to support and reassure you.</p><p/><p>There are lots of different methods women use to help them through labor and delivery. They might involve the things listed above, plus other things to help you relax and feel positive about giving birth. Your doctor, nurse, or midwife can talk to you about the different methods. They might also be able to suggest a class that you and your partner can take to help prepare you for labor and delivery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H301685744\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want medicine to manage my pain?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you want medicine during labor, let your doctor or nurse know. Doctors can use different medicines to help manage the pain of labor and delivery. The medicines can be given in different ways.</p><p>Options for pain relief include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An epidural or spinal block &ndash; For an epidural block, a doctor uses a needle to put a thin tube (called a &quot;catheter&quot;) into your back. He or she will give you medicine through this tube. For a spinal block, the doctor injects medicine into your back to numb the nerves in your spine. In many cases, the doctor combines these things, so you get a dose of medicine right away, and then the catheter stays in for the rest of your labor. The medicine can usually remove the pain in the lower part of your body.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A pudendal block &ndash; For a pudendal block, a doctor uses a needle to inject medicine around the nerves near the vagina. The medicine numbs the nerves so you don't feel as much pain while pushing your baby out. Unlike an epidural, it does not help with the pain of contractions. It is sometimes done in women who can't have or don't want an epidural. It can also be done in addition to an epidural, if the woman still has a lot of pain in the vaginal area.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A pudendal block is also sometimes used if the doctor has to do an &quot;assisted&quot; delivery. This means using a tool called &quot;forceps&quot; or a special vacuum to help get the baby out.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Opioid medicines &ndash; These are pain medicines that you can get through a thin tube that goes into your vein, called an &quot;IV,&quot; or as a shot. They mainly work by making you feel sleepy, which can help you not feel as much pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitrous-oxide-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Nitrous oxide</a> &ndash; In some countries, women have the option of using a gas called &quot;nitrous oxide&quot; to help with labor pain. The gas is inhaled through a face mask or mouthpiece. Nitrous oxide is available in some hospitals in the United States, but not all.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H301685751\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the downsides of the different medicines?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Medicines and procedures come with different downsides.</p><p>Some downsides of an epidural block include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After you get an epidural, you will probably need to stay in bed and won't be able to walk around.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An epidural can lower your blood pressure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you have an epidural for more than a few hours, you might get a fever. If this happens, the doctors might decide to give you or your baby antibiotics in case you have an infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After you give birth, you might have a headache.</p><p/><p>Some downsides of opioids include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Opioids can cause nausea or vomiting, in addition to making you feel sleepy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Opioids affect your baby, too. If you get them too close to delivery, they can make your baby too sleepy. Sometimes when this happens, the baby needs help with breathing after birth.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Each dose of medicine eventually wears off, so you might need more than one dose. Because doctors need to be careful not to give opioids too close to delivery, you might not be able to get them when you are having the most pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Since opioids work by making you sleepy, you might have a harder time pushing your baby out.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H301685800\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=how-to-tell-when-labor-starts-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: How to tell when labor starts (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=labor-and-delivery-childbirth-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Labor and delivery (childbirth) (The Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
