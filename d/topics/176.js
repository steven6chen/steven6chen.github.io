The characteristic site of involvement is the posterior scalp and neck. Infrequently, other areas of the scalp are affected. </p><p>AKN typically occurs in males of African ancestry, but also occasionally develops in females and in non-African ethnic groups. AKN may be pruritic, painful, or cosmetically disfiguring, contributing to negative effects on quality of life.</p><p>The clinical features, diagnosis, and management of AKN will be reviewed here. Other hair and scalp disorders are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-hair-loss\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and diagnosis of hair loss&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H98202219\"><span class=\"h1\">TERMINOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the term &quot;acne keloidalis nuchae&quot; is commonly used, there are other historical and contemporary descriptors for AKN. Historical terms for this condition include &quot;sycosis framboesiformis&quot; and &quot;dermatitis papillaris capillitii&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acne-keloidalis-nuchae/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Contemporary alternative names for AKN include &quot;folliculitis keloidalis&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acne-keloidalis-nuchae/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], &quot;folliculitis nuchae&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acne-keloidalis-nuchae/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], and &quot;folliculitis keloidalis nuchae&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acne-keloidalis-nuchae/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. In addition, because of the occasional extension to other areas of the scalp, some authors eliminate &quot;nuchae&quot; from AKN and refer to the disorder as &quot;acne keloidalis.&quot;</p><p>Multiple authors have suggested that the name &quot;acne keloidalis nuchae&quot; is a misnomer, since the lesions are neither pathologically acne nor keloids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acne-keloidalis-nuchae/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In contrast to true acne, comedones are never present in AKN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acne-keloidalis-nuchae/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The scar-like lesions, though they resemble keloids, do not typically recur following excision like keloids often do [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acne-keloidalis-nuchae/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], and patients typically do not have keloids elsewhere. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32378654\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AKN is a common disorder. People of African ancestry with Afro-textured hair are the predominant population at risk. This predilection was evident in a study of 453 male football players (aged 14 to 27 years); AKN was present in 14 percent of black players compared with 0 percent of white players [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acne-keloidalis-nuchae/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Moreover, studies performed in North America, the Caribbean, and Africa have found AKN to represent between 0.45 and 9 percent of diagnoses among black patients evaluated in dermatology clinics [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acne-keloidalis-nuchae/abstract/6,10-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,10-14</a>].</p><p>AKN affects males far more frequently than females, although females occasionally develop AKN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acne-keloidalis-nuchae/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. A 20:1 ratio of affected men to women is commonly quoted [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acne-keloidalis-nuchae/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In a community selected group in South Africa, 11 percent of 267 males versus 0.3 percent of 597 females had AKN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acne-keloidalis-nuchae/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p>Onset of disease typically follows adolescence and is rare after age 50 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acne-keloidalis-nuchae/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The predilection for the onset of AKN after adolescence was demonstrated in a study of 1042 South African school children (age 6 to 21 years). The prevalence of AKN was 0.67 percent overall, but among students in the final year of high school, the prevalence of AKN was 4.7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acne-keloidalis-nuchae/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32378660\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As evidenced by a multitude of proposed theories with variable levels of evidence, the cause of AKN has not been definitively established. Pathogenic mechanisms related to skin injury and aberrant immune responses to common antigens are among the cited theories.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Skin injury </strong>&ndash; Some theories of causality focus on chronic irritation or occlusion of the follicles due to hair cutting practices (eg, close shaves or close clipping), trauma, friction (eg, rubbing from shirt collars or helmets), heat, or humidity as a predisposing or exacerbating factor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acne-keloidalis-nuchae/abstract/11,20-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,20-23</a>]. Whether the tool used for hair cutting might influence risk for AKN is unclear; in a South African study, the prevalence of AKN did not appear to differ with the use of razors versus clippers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acne-keloidalis-nuchae/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Frequent and traumatic haircuts have also been proposed as potential contributors, though further study is necessary to determine whether these are relevant factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acne-keloidalis-nuchae/abstract/10,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">External insults are unlikely to be the sole causes of AKN, given the disproportionate number of cases that occur in men of African descent. The findings of a study of 453 male football players supports this; in contrast to the increased prevalence of AKN noted in black players, acne mechanica (an acneiform eruption induced by friction, occlusion, and heat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acne-keloidalis-nuchae/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]) occurred on the posterior neck at similar rates in black and white players [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acne-keloidalis-nuchae/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. A role for the Afro-textured hair type in AKN has been suggested based upon the increased prevalence in the black population, possibly related to the curvature and morphology of Afro-textured hair. Although penetration of curved hair into the skin has been proposed as a potential mechanism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acne-keloidalis-nuchae/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>], this theory has been questioned by authors who have found no clinical or pathologic evidence of hairs curving and re-entering the skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acne-keloidalis-nuchae/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Aberrant immune reaction </strong>&ndash; Another proposed pathogenic theory is based upon consideration of AKN as a form of primary cicatricial (scarring) alopecia stimulated by an immune response in the skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acne-keloidalis-nuchae/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-hair-loss#H1871427\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and diagnosis of hair loss&quot;, section on 'Cicatricial alopecia'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The following sequence of events for the development of AKN as a primary scarring alopecia has been proposed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acne-keloidalis-nuchae/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Intrafollicular antigens (particularly those that are more prevalent after puberty) attract inflammatory cells to the follicle at the level of the isthmus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F53952\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53952 \">figure 1</a>).

As with other proposed contributors, a role for these factors remains to be confirmed. AKN has also been reported in two patients with keratosis follicularis spinulosa decalvans, an X-linked genetic disorder that predisposes patients to the development of follicular hyperkeratosis and inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acne-keloidalis-nuchae/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=keratosis-pilaris-atrophicans#H298887933\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Keratosis pilaris atrophicans&quot;, section on 'Keratosis follicularis spinulosa decalvans'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32378666\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AKN presents with variable degrees of inflammation and keloid-like (keloidal) scarring on the posterior lower scalp and nape of the neck. Occasionally, involvement extends onto the vertex or other areas of the scalp (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F97622\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97622 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acne-keloidalis-nuchae/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. </p><p>Active inflammation in AKN manifests as inflamed papules or pustules (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F97613%7EDERM%2F97614%7EDERM%2F97615%7EDERM%2F97616%7EDERM%2F97617%7EDERM%2F97993%7EDERM%2F97994\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97613 graphicRef97614 graphicRef97615 graphicRef97616 graphicRef97617 graphicRef97993 graphicRef97994 \">picture 2A-G</a>). Inflammation may be acute, demonstrating marked erythema, inflamed papules, or papulopustules. Alternatively, a combination of acute inflammation and chronic inflammation (manifesting as pink to dusky red papules without pustules or discharge) may be present. The degree of inflammation ranges from mild to severe and can vary to some extent between episodes of flare in a given individual. Crusting or excoriation may be evident. In severe cases, draining sinus tracts or suppuration may be present.</p><p>Scarring is typically present by the time patients present for medical evaluation. Scarring is manifested by variably sized keloidal papules, plaques, or nodules at the site of previously involved hair follicles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F97618%7EDERM%2F97619%7EDERM%2F97620%7EDERM%2F97621%7EDERM%2F97994\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97618 graphicRef97619 graphicRef97620 graphicRef97621 graphicRef97994 \">picture 2G-K</a>). The keloidal papules of AKN are typically dome-shaped (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F97629\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97629 \">picture 3</a>). In the later stages of AKN, patients may present with chronic scarring or scarring alopecia without active inflammation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F97622\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97622 \">picture 1</a>). Tufted &quot;doll hairs,&quot; multiple hairs emerging from a single follicular orifice, may be present (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F97621\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97621 \">picture 2K</a>).</p><p>AKN may be asymptomatic or symptomatic. Pruritus or pain may accompany the skin lesions, particularly if pustules are present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acne-keloidalis-nuchae/abstract/6,17,20,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,17,20,25</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H98202654\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL COURSE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>AKN is a chronic disease with episodic flares of worsening inflammation. Effective treatment typically requires a maintenance regimen with therapeutic adjustments as needed for flares. With time (usually over a variable number of years), the disease tends to become less active in terms of inflammation. However, keloidal papules and plaques usually persist unless treated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32378672\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTOPATHOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Histopathologic findings vary based on the stage of the disease and the specific clinical features present in the immediate area of the biopsy. Typically, however, AKN is characterized by the presence of acute and chronic folliculitis, ruptured pilosebaceous units, and dense dermal (cicatricial-type) fibrosis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F97927%7EDERM%2F97928%7EDERM%2F97929%7EDERM%2F97930%7EDERM%2F97931\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97927 graphicRef97928 graphicRef97929 graphicRef97930 graphicRef97931 \">picture 4A-E</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Early stages</strong> &ndash; Dense follicular and perifollicular inflammatory infiltrate of lymphocytes and neutrophils. The dermal fibrosis resembles the collagen fibers seen in typical scar tissue more than the fibrosis seen in keloid scars [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acne-keloidalis-nuchae/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Later stages</strong> &ndash; Disrupted and broken hair follicles are surrounded by granulomatous inflammation, perifollicular abscess formation, and dermal fibrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acne-keloidalis-nuchae/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32378698\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of AKN can usually be made based upon the clinical findings. Biopsy is rarely necessary. The clinical findings that raise suspicion for a diagnosis of AKN are firm keloidal papules or plaques on the lower posterior scalp or upper posterior neck, with or without inflamed follicular papules or papulopustules. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Patient history </strong>&ndash; The patient history allows the clinician to collect information that may aid in supporting or negating a diagnosis of AKN, determining the best approach to management, and assessing the response to treatment. Knowledge of the following is useful:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Age of onset (post-adolescence to middle-age is typical for AKN)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Disease duration and rate of progression</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Symptoms (eg, pain, pruritus, drainage)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hair care practices (hair cutting and shaving)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Exacerbating factors</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Prior treatments (including response to each treatment)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Physical examination </strong>&ndash; The entire scalp should be examined. In typical acne keloidalis nuchae, the area of disease (inflammatory papules, pustules, and keloidal papules or plaques) is limited to the lower posterior scalp and nape of the neck. Crusting, excoriation, and in severe cases, suppuration, may be present.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Although AKN occasionally extends to other areas of the scalp [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acne-keloidalis-nuchae/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>], findings of follicular papules, inflammation, suppuration, or scarring on other areas of the scalp should prompt consideration of alternative diagnoses, such as dissecting cellulitis of the scalp, lichen planopilaris, follicular cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, tinea capitis, or another disorder. (See <a href=\"#H32378729\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Biopsy </strong>&ndash; Biopsy is usually unnecessary unless the presentation is atypical. If a biopsy is necessary for diagnosis, a 3 to 4 mm punch biopsy should be performed. Vertical sectioning of the pathology specimen is usually sufficient for recognizing pathologic characteristics of AKN. If the presentation is atypical or there are overlapping features suggestive of an alternate diagnosis, two biopsies may be performed to minimize the risk of misdiagnosis due to sampling error.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">It is essential that the biopsy be of sufficient depth to include the base of the follicle. It is also important to include a suspected keloidal papule. Biopsy solely of areas of severe inflammation or frank suppuration in the absence of keloidal papules may not be helpful. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other tests</strong> &ndash; If superinfection is a possibility (extensive erythema, suppuration, pain, drainage, odor, or systemic symptoms such as fever), bacterial culture should be obtained. The need for other tests is determined by the differential diagnosis. For example, if tinea capitis is suspected, a potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation or fungal culture is indicated. (See <a href=\"#H32378729\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32378729\"><span class=\"h1\">DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of AKN is usually straightforward, based on the clinical appearance and location of lesions. However, there are several disorders that may merit consideration if faced with an atypical presentation of AKN.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Acne mechanica</strong> &ndash; Acne mechanica is a frictional or traumatic folliculitis. The disorder may present on the nape of the neck or in any hair-bearing area subject to rubbing or friction. Unlike AKN, acne mechanica is usually transient and does not present with keloidal papules or plaques. Often, a specific trigger may be identifiable: eg, shaving, friction, or trauma from clothing or other apparel (eg, hat or helmet).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bacterial folliculitis</strong> &ndash; Bacterial folliculitis may occur due to bacterial colonization in the setting of minor trauma (eg, shaving) or follicular occlusion followed by secondary infection. Patients present with multiple follicle-based inflammatory papules and pustules (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F97630\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef97630 \">picture 5</a>). Unlike AKN, keloidal papules should not be present. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Molluscum contagiosum</strong> &ndash; Molluscum contagiosum presents with skin-colored papules that may resemble small keloidal papules (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F56699%7EDERM%2F97628\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56699 graphicRef97628 \">picture 6A-B</a>). The nape of the neck is an uncommon location for molluscum contagiosum; however, infection in this site could occur due to transmission via infected hair clippers or self-inoculation from other areas of the body. Close examination may help to differentiate molluscum contagiosum lesions from keloidal papules; molluscum lesions frequently exhibit central umbilication and are likely to be accompanied by lesions elsewhere on the body. Inflammation is usually minor or absent, unless molluscum become inflamed or secondarily infected. Biopsy findings should easily differentiate molluscum from AKN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acne-keloidalis-nuchae/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=molluscum-contagiosum#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Molluscum contagiosum&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Folliculitis decalvans </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Folliculitis decalvans is an uncommon form of cicatricial alopecia that typically presents with one or more confluent areas of scarring alopecia and multiple pustules that are often located at the periphery of the areas of alopecia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F91503%7EDERM%2F87488\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91503 graphicRef87488 \">picture 7A-B</a>). Tufted hairs may be present. Unlike AKN, multifocal involvement of the scalp is common and keloidal papules and plaques are not features of this disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folliculitis-decalvans\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Folliculitis decalvans&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dissecting cellulitis of the scalp</strong> &ndash; Dissecting cellulitis of the scalp is an uncommon form of cicatricial alopecia in which patients develop follicular papules, pustules, fluctuant nodules, and abscesses on the scalp that result in scarring (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F91508%7EDERM%2F75929\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef91508 graphicRef75929 \">picture 8A-B</a>). Young men of African descent are most frequently affected. Keloidal papules and plaques are not a feature of dissecting cellulitis of the scalp. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dissecting-cellulitis-of-the-scalp\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dissecting cellulitis of the scalp&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Lichen planopilaris</strong> &ndash; Lichen planopilaris should be easy to distinguish from AKN. Affected patients present with fine perifollicular papules with scale and erythema at the base of affected hairs. The perifollicular papules are smaller than those typically seen in AKN. Macules or patches of alopecia may be present (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F90009\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef90009 \">picture 9</a>). Pustules should not be present, nor should there be keloidal papules or plaques. Lichen planopilaris can be located anywhere on the scalp.

However, a significant difference in response was not noted between 8 and 12 weeks.</p><p>When treating patients with AKN, we typically prescribe a high-potency (group 1 or group 2 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62402\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62402 \">table 1</a>)) topical corticosteroid and instruct the patient to apply the corticosteroid once or twice daily to the affected area. Because we usually simultaneously prescribe a topical antibiotic or topical retinoid, we most frequently ask patients to use the topical corticosteroid once daily (see <a href=\"#H194010470\" class=\"local\">'Adjunctive therapies'</a> below). The topical corticosteroid is applied before bed. In order to minimize risk for corticosteroid side effects, we instruct patients to use the topical corticosteroid in two-week cycles that alternate with two-week treatment-free intervals. Topical corticosteroids are available in a variety of vehicles (eg, ointments, foams, gels, creams, solutions), which can be selected based upon patient preference. We find that many of our patients prefer ointments or lotions, as these formulations tend to be more soothing and cosmetically acceptable.</p><p>Of note, in the setting of severe suppuration or many pustules on the scalp, suggesting superinfection, we delay topical corticosteroid treatment. Topical corticosteroid therapy may begin following treatment with oral antibiotics and resolution of symptoms suggestive of infection or suppuration. (See <a href=\"#H286650758\" class=\"local\">'Moderate to severe inflammation'</a> below.)</p><p>We reevaluate patients every four to six weeks to assess the response to treatment and to observe for adverse effects. We expect a response to topical corticosteroid therapy (noticeable reduction in severity of papules and pustules) within the first six to eight weeks of treatment, followed by continued improvement with continued therapy. Once sufficient improvement is achieved, we discontinue the topical corticosteroid with the plan to restart therapy if symptoms recur. If little improvement is evident after six to eight weeks treatment, we transition to other therapies. (See <a href=\"#H286650758\" class=\"local\">'Moderate to severe inflammation'</a> below and <a href=\"#H286650876\" class=\"local\">'Refractory inflammation'</a> below.)</p><p>Potential adverse effects of topical corticosteroids include cutaneous atrophy and hypopigmentation at the treatment site.

If the affected area is too large to excise in a single procedure, staged excision with primary closure or secondary intention healing are options [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acne-keloidalis-nuchae/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span><strong>Secondary intention healing</strong> &ndash; Secondary intention healing eliminates concern for excessive wound tension that may occur with primary wound closure, but requires an average of 6 to 12 weeks for the wound to close. Scars often contract to a smaller size than the initial excised area, yielding improved cosmesis after healing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acne-keloidalis-nuchae/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. One review found data to suggest that fewer recurrences occur with secondary intention healing than with primary closure; however, further study would be necessary to confirm this finding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acne-keloidalis-nuchae/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. The authors postulated that the secondary intention healing process might effectively eliminate hair-bearing tissue or that the inflammatory response or process of prolonged healing might have other beneficial effects on AKN [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acne-keloidalis-nuchae/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Split thickness skin grafting also has been described but is considered less than optimal, since the scar is usually depressed and texturally different (shiny and smooth) compared with the surrounding skin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acne-keloidalis-nuchae/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. In addition, the color of the grafted skin usually does not match the surrounding skin.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Evidence </strong>&ndash; Although surgery is considered an effective treatment for AKN, few studies have evaluated its efficacy. One of the largest studies evaluating surgical intervention for AKN involved 25 men with AKN refractory to medical therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acne-keloidalis-nuchae/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. The patients had extensive, coalescent keloidal plaques on the nuchal scalp. Twenty patients underwent complete excision with primary closure of the surgical defect. The remainder had lesions too large for this procedure and had either a two-stage excision with primary closure (four patients) or excision with secondary-intention healing (one patient). One year after the procedure, the surgeon and the patients both rated cosmetic results as good to excellent. Complications included mild recurrence of small papules and pustules in 15 patients (managed with topical corticosteroids) and hypertrophic scars in four patients who had excision of large lesions and primary wound closure in a single procedure. In this particular study, the four patients who underwent electrosurgical excision seemed to have a greater requirement for pain medication than patients whose excisions were performed with a scalpel. However, good tolerance of electrosurgery has also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acne-keloidalis-nuchae/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Successful treatment with carbon dioxide laser excision followed by secondary-intention healing was described in a series that included six patients treated with this modality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acne-keloidalis-nuchae/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. No patients experienced recurrences during follow-up periods of 3 to 47 months. Two patients developed slight hypertrophic scarring that responded well to intralesional injection of corticosteroids.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Postsurgical interventions </strong>&ndash; Intralesional corticosteroid injections are useful for softening and flattening hypertrophic scars and can be used if such scars develop after surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acne-keloidalis-nuchae/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. Some authors suggest use of intralesional corticosteroid injections beginning at the time of suture removal from sutured wounds, as is often done after the excision of true keloids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acne-keloidalis-nuchae/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. However, the effect of prophylactic intralesional corticosteroid injections on patient outcomes has not been specifically evaluated for AKN. Of note, intralesional corticosteroid injections may inhibit wound contraction and should not be performed in wounds that will heal by secondary intention. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=keloids-and-hypertrophic-scars#H240452667\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Keloids and hypertrophic scars&quot;, section on 'Excision'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Studies have yielded mixed results on the efficacy of topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=imiquimod-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">imiquimod</a> for the prevention of postsurgical recurrence of true keloids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acne-keloidalis-nuchae/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].

The findings of a small, split-scalp randomized trial of patients with papular lesions of AKN suggest that targeted UVB phototherapy may be a useful therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acne-keloidalis-nuchae/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Patients were randomly assigned to targeted UVB treatment three times per week to the affected area on either the right or left side of the scalp for eight weeks. The UVB device emitted 290 nm to 320 nm light, with peaks at 303 nm and 313 nm. After eight weeks, both sides of the scalp were treated. After the initial eight week period, the mean lesion count on the treated sides decreased significantly, while the counts on the untreated side did not change. Further improvement was demonstrated in sites that received an additional eight weeks of UVB treatment. </p><p>UVB therapy was well tolerated; side effects were mild, including a transient burning sensation, erythema, and hyperpigmentation.

Most cases of AKN occur in post-adolescent males of African descent. Less frequently, other individuals develop AKN. (See <a href=\"#H32378654\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The cause of AKN is unclear. Proposed contributory factors have included possession of Afro-textured hair, close shaving or clipping of hair, and factors that may irritate or occlude hair follicles on the posterior scalp and neck. Some authors consider AKN a form of primary scarring alopecia. (See <a href=\"#H32378660\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The major clinical findings of AKN include inflammatory papules, pustules, and keloid-like papules or plaques on the posterior scalp and nape of the neck. The severity of involvement varies widely. Patients may be asymptomatic or symptomatic. Symptomatic patients may experience pain or pruritus. (See <a href=\"#H32378666\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of AKN usually can be made based upon the clinical evaluation. Clinical findings that strongly suggest a diagnosis of AKN include firm keloid-like papules or plaques on the lower posterior scalp or nape of the neck, with or without inflamed papules or pustules. Biopsy is not typically necessary, but can be useful for confirming the diagnosis in atypical cases. (See <a href=\"#H32378698\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Data on treatments for AKN are limited. Treatment goals include reducing inflammation, minimizing exposure to potential exacerbating factors, and improving the appearance of scarred areas. Early treatment is important to minimize risk for severe scarring. (See <a href=\"#H108892260\" class=\"local\">'Approach to treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with mild to moderate inflammation in sites of AKN (small inflammatory papules or pustules), we suggest high-potency topical corticosteroid therapy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We typically use a topical antibacterial agent or topical retinoid as adjunctive therapy. (See <a href=\"#H286650720\" class=\"local\">'Mild to moderate inflammation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with more severe inflammation, we suggest oral antibiotic therapy as initial treatment (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We typically use oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a>. If secondary infection is suspected, cultures and sensitivity testing should be performed and antibiotic therapy should be prescribed as appropriate. In the absence of infection, we often simultaneously treat with a topical corticosteroid. Intralesional corticosteroid injections also can be useful for treatment of persistent, noninfectious inflammation. (See <a href=\"#H286650758\" class=\"local\">'Moderate to severe inflammation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Scarring from AKN can result in significant cosmetic disfigurement. For patients with keloidal papules or small plaques who desire cosmetic improvement, we suggest intralesional corticosteroid injection as initial treatment (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For patients with larger plaques or keloidal scars that do not improve sufficiently with intralesional corticosteroid injection, we suggest surgical excision (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H32378905\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of keloidal scarring'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acne-keloidalis-nuchae/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Kaposi M. &Uuml;ber die sogenannte Framboesia und mehrere andere Arten von papillaren neubildungel der Haut.
