This will make it less likely that the hearing loss will cause problems with learning to talk</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H97592964\"><span class=\"h1\">How will my newborn be screened for hearing loss?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are 2 different tests for hearing loss in newborns:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Auditory brainstem response &ndash; For this test, the doctor will put 3 small devices called electrodes on your baby: on the forehead, back of the neck, and behind the ear. The electrodes connect to a machine that measures how your baby's brain responds to a clicking sound.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Otoacoustic emissions &ndash; For this test, the doctor puts a small microphone into your baby's ear. The microphone makes sounds (clicks or a tone) and measures sound waves from the cochlea, the area inside the ear that allows you to hear (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F55121\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef55121 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p>Both of these tests are painless and take between 5 to 15 minutes. If a test suggests that your newborn has hearing loss, he or she will get another test. Your baby might also need to be checked by an expert in hearing problems, called an &quot;audiologist.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H97592979\"><span class=\"h1\">Are some newborns more likely to have hearing loss?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Newborns with certain conditions are more likely to have hearing loss. These conditions include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Being in the &quot;neonatal intensive care unit&quot; (also called the &quot;NICU&quot;) for more than 2 days. Newborns spend time in the NICU if they are born too early or have other health problems.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A family history of hearing loss in childhood or other conditions that cause hearing problems</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An abnormal shape to 1 or both ears</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infections</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A serious form of a condition called &quot;jaundice&quot; that causes yellow skin and other problems</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H97592996\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=when-a-baby-is-born-premature-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: When a baby is born premature (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=what-to-expect-in-the-nicu-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: What to expect in the NICU (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=jaundice-in-babies-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Jaundice in babies (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=jaundice-in-newborn-infants-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Jaundice in newborn infants (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
