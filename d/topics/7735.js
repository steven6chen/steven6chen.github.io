The clinical features of geriatric bipolar disorder differ from those of younger patients in that cognitive impairment and comorbid general medical illnesses are more common in geriatric patients, whereas comorbid anxiety and substance use disorders may be less common in geriatric patients. (See <a href=\"#H1292379\" class=\"local\">'Geriatric bipolar disorder'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=geriatric-bipolar-disorder-epidemiology-clinical-features-assessment-and-diagnosis#H7214018\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Geriatric bipolar disorder: Epidemiology, clinical features, assessment, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bipolar disorder is a highly recurrent illness. For geriatric bipolar patients, we recommend maintenance treatment rather than no treatment (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>).
