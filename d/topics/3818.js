The reduction in tissue perfusion results in decreased oxygen and nutrient delivery to the tissues and, if prolonged, potentially end-organ damage and multi-system failure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-classification-etiology-and-pathophysiology-of-shock-in-adults#H1\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, classification, etiology, and pathophysiology of shock in adults&quot;, section on 'Introduction'</a>.) &#160;</p><p>Acute myocardial infarction (MI) is the most common cause of cardiogenic shock and is defined as a clinical event consequent to the death of cardiac myocytes (myocardial necrosis) that is caused by ischemia (as opposed to other etiologies such as myocarditis or trauma). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=criteria-for-the-diagnosis-of-acute-myocardial-infarction#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Criteria for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction&quot;, section on 'Acute MI'</a>.)</p><p>Cardiogenic shock is the leading cause of death in patients with acute MI, with hospital mortality rates approaching 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cardiogenic-shock-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Short-term prognosis is directly related to the severity of the hemodynamic disorder. The clinical manifestations and diagnosis of cardiogenic shock in acute MI will be reviewed here. The prognosis and treatment are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prognosis-and-treatment-of-cardiogenic-shock-complicating-acute-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prognosis and treatment of cardiogenic shock complicating acute myocardial infarction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>An overview of the types of shock in adults and the diagnostic approach to such patients is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-classification-etiology-and-pathophysiology-of-shock-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, classification, etiology, and pathophysiology of shock in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All forms of shock, including hypovolemic and distributive, are characterized by relatively low blood pressure and manifestations of end-organ hypoperfusion, such as poor mentation or low urine output. Patients with cardiogenic shock have a low cardiac index (&lt;2.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min/m<sup>2</sup>),</span> elevated filling pressures of the left, right, or both ventricles, and a decreased mixed venous oxygen saturation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F73000\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef73000 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cardiogenic-shock-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. Some patients have only modest elevation of left ventricular filling pressures despite depressed left ventricular ejection faction. These patients more often have baseline preserved renal function and first myocardial infarction (MI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cardiogenic-shock-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The systemic vascular resistance is often high, but it may be in the normal or low range. Individuals with normal or low range of systemic vascular resistance represent a group of patients with more profound hypoperfusion and inflammatory response and associated worse prognosis &#160;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cardiogenic-shock-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Failure of the left or right ventricle (due to myocardial muscle dysfunction) to pump an adequate amount of blood is the primary cause of cardiogenic shock in acute MI (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F65867\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65867 \">figure 1</a>). Hypotension, tissue hypoperfusion, and pulmonary congestion or systemic venous congestion result. </p><p>Systemic hypotension, which is present in most patients with cardiogenic shock, is defined as a persistent systolic blood pressure below 80 to 90 mmHg or a mean blood pressure 30 mmHg lower than the patient's baseline level. In cardiogenic shock, hypotension results from a decrease in stroke volume and a severe reduction in the cardiac index (&lt;1.8 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/</span> min per m<sup>2</sup> without support or &lt;2.2 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span> per m<sup>2</sup> with support). &#160; </p><p>The fall in blood pressure may in part be moderated by a marked elevation in systemic vascular resistance (SVR), a response that is mediated by increased release of endogenous vasopressors such as norepinephrine and angiotensin II. However, the combination of a low cardiac output and elevated SVR may result in a marked reduction in tissue perfusion. </p><p>The associated decrease in coronary perfusion pressure can lead to a vicious cycle of ischemia, further myocardial dysfunction, and a downward spiral with progressive end-organ hypoperfusion and ultimately death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cardiogenic-shock-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p>Hypotension and elevation of SVR occur in the presence of an elevated pulmonary capillary wedge pressure if left ventricular dysfunction is the primary cardiac disorder. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathophysiology-of-heart-failure-left-ventricular-pressure-volume-and-other-hemodynamic-relationships#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathophysiology of heart failure: Left ventricular pressure-volume and other hemodynamic relationships&quot;, section on 'Normal left ventricular pressure-volume relationship'</a>.) Elevation of the right ventricular (RV) filling pressure occurs when isolated RV shock is present, such as might occur with a large RV infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cardiogenic-shock-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/2,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=right-ventricular-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Right ventricular myocardial infarction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Acute MI, due to acute occlusion of one or more coronary arteries, is the most common clinical entity leading to cardiogenic shock. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> below.) In this setting, myocardial ischemia or infarction leads to a fall in the stroke volume (of either the left or right ventricle or both) and cardiac output and, as mentioned above, often a compensatory increase in the systemic vascular resistance. </p><p>However, not all patients fall into this hemodynamic profile. In the SHOCK trial of patients with confirmed cardiogenic shock developing within 36 hours of an acute MI, the mean left ventricular ejection fraction on echocardiography was unexpectedly high at 31 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cardiogenic-shock-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Furthermore, calculated systemic vascular resistance varied widely and on average was not elevated despite vasopressor use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cardiogenic-shock-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Thus, in some patients, post-MI shock is accompanied by relative vasodilation rather than vasoconstriction. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-classification-etiology-and-pathophysiology-of-shock-in-adults#H2750341\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, classification, etiology, and pathophysiology of shock in adults&quot;, section on 'Distributive'</a>.). </p><p>The most likely explanation for vasodilation in the setting of cardiogenic shock is the presence of a systemic inflammatory state similar to that seen with sepsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cardiogenic-shock-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sepsis-syndromes-in-adults-epidemiology-definitions-clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-prognosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sepsis syndromes in adults: Epidemiology, definitions, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and prognosis&quot;</a>.) In the SHOCK trial, 54 of the 302 patients (18 percent) had fever <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> leukocytosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cardiogenic-shock-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The systemic inflammation was diagnosed two to four days after the onset of shock and these patients had a relatively lower systemic vascular resistance. Among the 54 patients, 40 were subsequently considered to be potentially infected as evidenced by a positive culture; 14 were culture negative. The lower the initial systemic vascular resistance, the greater the likelihood of developing culture positive systemic inflammation. The latter observation suggests that inappropriate vasodilation may play an important role in both the pathogenesis and persistence of shock and in the likelihood of infection.</p><p>The acute inflammatory response in MI is associated with elevated serum cytokine concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cardiogenic-shock-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Cytokine activation leads to induction of nitric oxide (NO) synthase and increased levels of NO, which can cause inappropriate vasodilation with reduced systemic and coronary perfusion pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cardiogenic-shock-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/3,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,12</a>]. This sequence may be similar to that seen in septic shock, which is also characterized by systemic vasodilation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-classification-etiology-and-pathophysiology-of-shock-in-adults#H2750341\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, classification, etiology, and pathophysiology of shock in adults&quot;, section on 'Distributive'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H607023030\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The incidence of cardiogenic shock after myocardial infarction (MI) was constant in the 1970s and 1980s and complicated approximately 5 to 9 percent of acute ST-elevation MI (STEMI) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cardiogenic-shock-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/2,13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,13-16</a>]. More data (between the late 1990s and 2006) from large registries have shown a decrease in the rate of cardiogenic shock by as much as 25 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cardiogenic-shock-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/1,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,17,18</a>]. </p><p>As an example, three nationwide French registries conducted five years apart and including 7531 individuals were used to evaluate the incidence of and outcomes after cardiogenic shock in the setting of MI (STEMI and non-ST elevation MI) between 1995 and 2005 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cardiogenic-shock-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The incidence decreased significantly from 6.9 percent in 1995 to 5.7 percent in 2005. Over this period, mortality fell from 70 to 51 percent, though mortality in patients over the age of 85 remained very high (64.7 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cardiogenic-shock-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Trends from the CathPCI registry demonstrated an increase in cardiogenic shock in-hospital mortality in 2011 to 2013 compared with 2005 to 2006 (27.6 percent in 2005 to 2006 versus 30.6 percent in 2011 to 2013, adjusted OR 1.09, CI 1.005-1.173; p = 0.04). Patients in the latter period had more medical comorbidities including diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and end stage renal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cardiogenic-shock-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Severe dysfunction of the left ventricle (LV) is the most common presentation of cardiogenic shock in the setting of acute myocardial infarction (MI) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F69673\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef69673 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cardiogenic-shock-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/6,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,21</a>]. The majority of patients have an acute ST elevation MI, but cardiogenic shock also occurs in approximately 2.5 percent of patients with a non-ST elevation MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cardiogenic-shock-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/2,22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,22,23</a>]. Severe dysfunction is often associated with an anterior MI, but may result from an infarct in any location, particularly in patients who have had a prior infarct. </p><p>Severe extensive ischemia due to multivessel coronary artery disease can also result in shock with an infarct of any size. Autopsy studies in patients dying with cardiogenic shock due to acute MI have revealed that &ge;40 percent of the LV myocardium is infarcted (old and new) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cardiogenic-shock-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Most patients have severe three vessel coronary disease on coronary angiography. Severe right ventricular (RV) failure is a cause of, or a major contributor to, cardiogenic shock in 5 percent of cases and is typically seen with an inferior MI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cardiogenic-shock-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Such patients do not develop pulmonary congestion unless there is concurrent involvement of the LV. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=right-ventricular-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Right ventricular myocardial infarction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Cardiogenic shock can also be caused by mechanical complications of MI. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mechanical-complications-of-acute-myocardial-infarction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Mechanical complications of acute myocardial infarction&quot;</a>.) Causes include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute, severe mitral regurgitation resulting from rupture of a papillary muscle or chordae tendineae or severe papillary muscle dysfunction. This is more common in the setting of inferoposterior infarction but can occur with any infarct location. When LV failure causes shock, associated mitral regurgitation is common. The SHOCK trial, which evaluated early revascularization for cardiogenic shock after acute MI, excluded patients with mechanical causes of shock; 39 percent had echocardiographic evidence of moderate or severe mitral regurgitation, which correlated with poorer survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cardiogenic-shock-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rupture of the interventricular septum after either an anterior or inferior infarction, with an acute left-to-right shunt, which is associated with the highest risk of in-hospital mortality (87 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cardiogenic-shock-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac tamponade due to either rupture of the LV free wall or a hemorrhagic pericardial effusion.

Patients who develop delayed cardiogenic shock following MI often slip slowly into shock, with clinical evidence of a low cardiac output prior to the development of hypotension. The delay in the development of cardiogenic shock is likely due to the eventual failure of the initial compensatory mechanisms that protect against the adverse hemodynamic consequences of a large infarction and associated mechanical complications. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Etiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathophysiology'</a> above.)</p><p>The time course was evaluated in a report from the GUSTO-I trial of 41,000 patients with acute MI who were treated with fibrinolytic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cardiogenic-shock-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. The following observations were made with respect to cardiogenic shock:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shock was present on admission in 0.8 percent at hospital presentation and an additional 5.3 percent developed shock after admission, either as a sudden event or as a gradual fall in blood pressure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Approximately 50 percent of patients who developed shock after admission did so within the first 24 hours after the infarct; most remaining cases occurred in the following days, with a few cases being delayed for up to one week. Similar findings were noted in the SHOCK trial in which the median time from MI to onset of cardiogenic shock was 5.5 hours and 75 percent of patients who developed shock did so within 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cardiogenic-shock-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p/><p>A community-based observational study of 5782 patients with acute myocardial infarction who were admitted to 11 hospitals in Massachusetts between 2001 and 2011, of whom 5.2 were diagnosed with cardiogenic shock, examined the frequency, timing, and outcome of cardiogenic shock that developed pre-hospital, within the first 24 hours (early) after admission, and thereafter (late). The proportion with prehospital cardiogenic shock (1.6 percent) and late cardiogenic shock (1.5 percent) remained stable over time, but the proportion with early cardiogenic shock declined from 2.2 percent in 2001 to 2003 to 1.2 percent in 2009 to 2011. Of those with STEMI (n = 1853), 2.5 percent had pre-hospital, 4.3 percent had early, and 2.1 percent had late development of cardiogenic shock. For those with non-ST elevation MI (n = 3929), the proportions were 1.2 percent at each time point (p&lt;0.001). This confirms older data from clinical trials.</p><p>The development of late cardiogenic shock may be related to recurrent ischemia or reinfarction or to mechanical complications, such as rupture of the ventricular septum, ventricular free wall, or papillary muscle. The clinical presentation of recurrent ischemia or reinfarction usually consists of recurrent chest pain, recurrent or new ST segment elevation, and hypotension; some patients, however, have the sudden onset of dyspnea rather than chest pain.

(See <a href=\"#H343520804\" class=\"local\">'History and physical examination'</a> above.) </p><p>When a patient is strongly suspected of having cardiogenic shock, the diagnostic evaluation should be carried out in conjunction with resuscitative efforts.

The electrocardiogram may confirm the presence of recurrent ischemia, particularly in patients who have been reperfused and, in most cases, the echocardiogram can confirm the diagnosis. Patients in whom the diagnosis remains uncertain, or if the patient has not responded to initial resuscitative efforts, may undergo placement of a balloon-tipped pulmonary artery (Swan-Ganz) catheter to confirm diagnosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> to guide management.

However, it may be difficult to obtain an adequate image with this modality in critically ill patients, particularly those supported by mechanical ventilation. If the patient is taken for a cardiac catheterization, then a ventriculogram may be useful to assess left ventricular function and diagnose mechanical complications. If the initial echocardiogram images are limited or echocardiography is unavailable, a transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) may provide important information. There are, for example, cases in which moderate mitral regurgitation was visualized on transthoracic echocardiography but subsequent TEE revealed a flail mitral leaflet with severe mitral regurgitation. TEE may also more clearly demonstrate ventricular septal rupture with a shunt visualized by color flow Doppler (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F64363\" class=\"graphic graphic_movie graphicRef64363 \">movie 5</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemodynamic monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients in whom the diagnosis remains uncertain, or if the patient has not responded to initial resuscitative efforts, may undergo placement of a balloon-tipped pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) to confirm diagnosis <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> to guide management and assess the need for more aggressive mechanical cardiac support [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-cardiogenic-shock-in-acute-myocardial-infarction/abstract/7,32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,32,33</a>].

The clinical presentation often includes a history of recurrent chest pain or difficulty breathing. Findings on examination usually include hypotension, cool extremities, oliguria, alteration in mental status, cool clammy skin, and respiratory distress. There is evidence of metabolic acidosis (low serum bicarbonate and elevated serum lactate) on laboratory testing.
