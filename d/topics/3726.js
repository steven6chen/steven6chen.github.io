It is one of the most common causes of disabling daytime sleepiness after obstructive sleep apnea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Other diagnoses may be worth considering, and a general approach to the patient with chronic sleepiness is presented elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-excessive-daytime-sleepiness\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with excessive daytime sleepiness&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The epidemiology, clinical features, etiology, and diagnosis of narcolepsy are reviewed here. Narcolepsy in children and the treatment of narcolepsy in adults are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=narcolepsy-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Narcolepsy in children&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-narcolepsy-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of narcolepsy in adults&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Narcolepsy type 1 (narcolepsy with cataplexy) is estimated to have a prevalence of 25 to 50 per 100,000 people and an incidence of 0.74 per 100,000 person-years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. It is equally common in men and women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. Narcolepsy typically begins in the teens and early twenties, but occasionally occurs as early as five years of age or after 40 years of age. The prevalence of narcolepsy type 2 (narcolepsy without cataplexy) is uncertain because it is not as well studied; however, it has been estimated to be 20 to 34 per 100,000 people [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3830849\"><span class=\"h1\">ETIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Loss of orexin (hypocretin) signaling, genetic factors, and rare brain lesions can cause narcolepsy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3830874\"><span class=\"h2\">Orexin/hypocretin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Narcolepsy results from the loss of the neuropeptides, orexin-A and orexin-B (also known as hypocretin-1 and hypocretin-2). These neurotransmitters are products of the prepro-orexin gene and are made by neurons in the lateral hypothalamus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Orexin-A and -B have excitatory effects when they bind the ox1 and ox2 receptors on postsynaptic neurons. </p><p>The orexins are released during wakefulness and increase the activity of many brain regions involved in the promotion of wakefulness, including the locus coeruleus, raphe nuclei, and tuberomammillary nucleus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F50811\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50811 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/12-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-16</a>]. By increasing the activity of these wake-promoting aminergic neurons, orexins stabilize wakefulness, prevent inappropriate transitions into rapid eye movement (REM) or non-REM sleep, and inhibit REM sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>]. Loss of orexins may allow REM sleep-related phenomena (eg, cataplexy, hypnagogic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis) to intrude into wakefulness (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F75330\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75330 \">figure 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stages-and-architecture-of-normal-sleep\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stages and architecture of normal sleep&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Animal models first identified the importance of orexins in narcolepsy. Dogs with mutations in the ox2 receptor were found to have sleepiness and cataplexy very similar to human narcolepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Mice lacking orexin peptides or the orexin neurons also had severe narcolepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/21-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">21-23</a>]. Very similar behavior was seen in mice lacking both orexin receptors.</p><p>People with narcolepsy are typically classified as having either narcolepsy type 1 (narcolepsy with cataplexy) or narcolepsy type 2 (narcolepsy without cataplexy). Those with narcolepsy type 1 were subsequently shown to also have orexin deficiency. Whereas most animal models have a loss of orexin signaling due to mutations in the genes coding for orexins or their receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>], people who have narcolepsy type 1 have a roughly 90 percent reduction in the number of hypothalamic neurons producing orexins with little or no detectable orexin-A in their spinal fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/24,27-34\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,27-34</a>]. The neuronal loss appears to be selective since adjacent neurons containing melanin-concentrating hormone are preserved.</p><p>An increase in the number of histaminergic neurons in the tuberomammillary nucleus has been observed in the brains of patients with narcolepsy type 1 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. Most likely, this is a compensatory response to the loss of excitatory input from orexin neurons, and its physiological significance remains unclear. </p><p>The cause of narcolepsy type 2 is unknown, and these patients usually have normal CSF orexin-A levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/28,30,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,30,32</a>]. It has been hypothesized that this disorder may result from less extensive loss of the orexin neurons [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>], impaired orexin receptor signaling, or a completely separate mechanism. About 24 percent of patients who have narcolepsy type 2 have low CSF orexin-A levels, and about half of these individuals may later develop cataplexy, suggesting progression of the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3830881\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Narcolepsy usually occurs sporadically, but genetic factors play an important role. The DQB1*0602 haplotype (a subtype of DR2) is present in 95 percent of patients with cataplexy and in 96 percent of those with orexin deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/28,32,39-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,32,39-42</a>]. Some additional human leukocyte antigen (HLA) haplotypes may further increase the risk of narcolepsy, while others appear protective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>]. Though these and other genetic factors may predispose some people to develop narcolepsy, environmental factors appear to be even more important, as only about 25 percent of affected monozygotic twins are concordant for narcolepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=human-leukocyte-antigens-hla-a-roadmap\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Human leukocyte antigens (HLA): A roadmap&quot;</a>.)</p><p>On rare occasions, narcolepsy runs in families. Affected individuals often lack DQB1*0602 and have normal orexin-A levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/28,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,46</a>]. Some family members lacking definite narcolepsy may have isolated sleepiness, hallucinations, or sleep paralysis, suggesting incomplete penetrance. The genes underlying these familial cases are generally unknown, but eight Japanese families with narcolepsy showed linkage to a site on chromosome 4p13-q21, which may act in concert with the HLA-influenced predisposition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Other families have been reported with linkage to the myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein gene and sites on chromosome 6 (near the HLA region) and chromosome 21 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/48-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-50</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3830888\"><span class=\"h2\">Autoimmune hypothesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many researchers have hypothesized that the orexin neurons are selectively killed by an autoimmune process, since narcolepsy is strongly associated with a certain HLA haplotype, DQB1*0602 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. The onset of narcolepsy appears highest in the spring, suggesting that it may be triggered by a winter infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. One possible trigger is streptococcal pharyngitis, because anti-streptolysin O (ASO) and anti-DNase B titers are sometimes elevated, especially in the first year after the onset of narcolepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. </p><p>A T cell-mediated process is possible because narcolepsy is linked to a polymorphism in the T cell receptor alpha gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. A humoral mechanism is also possible, as antibodies against tribbles homolog 2, a protein expressed in neurons, are increased in some patients soon after the onset of narcolepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>]. The number of astrocytes may be moderately increased in the orexin neuron region [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/33,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,57</a>], which is consistent with an inflammatory or neurodegenerative process.</p><p>Individuals in several countries in Europe developed narcolepsy type 1 soon after receiving Pandemrix, an AS03-adjuvanted 2009 H1N1 influenza vaccine. Pandemrix was used in some European countries during the 2009-2010 H1N1 influenza pandemic, but it was not used in the United States. The risk of narcolepsy after Pandemrix was clearly greatest in children and adolescents with DQB1*0602. One proposed mechanism is cross-reactivity between the human hypocretin 2 receptor and influenza nucleoprotein A, a protein found in higher concentrations in Pandemrix compared with other H1N1 vaccines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. This association is discussed in greater detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-pandemic-h1n1-influenza-swine-influenza#H592844613\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of pandemic H1N1 influenza ('swine influenza')&quot;, section on 'Narcolepsy'</a>.)</p><p>The autoimmune hypothesis remains somewhat controversial, however [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Neuroimaging studies have found no consistent abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/60-65\" class=\"abstract_t\">60-65</a>]. Furthermore, the CSF of patients with narcolepsy lacks increased protein or oligoclonal bands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/66,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">66,67</a>]. Microglia and tumor necrosis factor alpha mRNA are not increased in the hypothalami of narcoleptics examined decades after the onset of symptoms, suggesting that there is no ongoing inflammation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. If the orexin neurons are killed by an autoimmune mechanism, the process must be subtle.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3830895\"><span class=\"h2\">Secondary narcolepsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In rare cases, lesions of the posterior hypothalamus and midbrain can cause narcolepsy. Tumors, vascular malformations, strokes, and inflammatory processes such as neurosarcoidosis have all been reported to cause secondary narcolepsy, most likely due to direct injury to the orexin neurons or their projections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/68-79\" class=\"abstract_t\">68-79</a>].</p><p>Narcolepsy can also occur with genetic syndromes such as Prader-Willi syndrome or Niemann-Pick disease type C, and sleepiness and cataplexy-like events are seen in some patients with Prader-Willi syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/80-83\" class=\"abstract_t\">80-83</a>]. Paraneoplastic anti-Ma2 antibodies can produce hypothalamic encephalitis with sleepiness, cataplexy, and low orexin-A levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/84-86\" class=\"abstract_t\">84-86</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-prader-willi-syndrome#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of Prader-Willi syndrome&quot;, section on 'Sleep apnea'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-niemann-pick-disease#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of Niemann-Pick disease&quot;, section on 'Classification and clinical features'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paraneoplastic-and-autoimmune-encephalitis#H3370761\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paraneoplastic and autoimmune encephalitis&quot;, section on 'Ma2-associated encephalitis'</a>.)</p><p>These processes damage much more than just the orexin neurons; thus, all patients with secondary narcolepsy have obvious neurologic deficits, with cognitive, emotional, motor, endocrine, or eye movement abnormalities. In contrast with typical narcolepsy, nearly all patients with secondary narcolepsy have an increase in their total amount of sleep, often sleeping 12 hours or more each day. Neuroimaging is unnecessary in narcoleptic patients with a normal bedside neurologic exam. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-detailed-neurologic-examination-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The detailed neurologic examination in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Narcolepsy can be conceptualized as a disorder of sleep-wake control in which elements of sleep intrude into wakefulness and elements of wakefulness intrude into sleep. The result is the classic tetrad of chronic daytime sleepiness with varying amounts of cataplexy, hypnagogic hallucinations, and sleep paralysis. Only one-third of patients will have all of these symptoms; thus, the diagnosis of narcolepsy should be considered even among patients with chronic daytime sleepiness alone. The features of narcolepsy frequently worsen during the first few months to years and then persist for life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26264676\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical presentation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with narcolepsy type 1 (narcolepsy with cataplexy) typically present with moderate to severe daytime sleepiness, transient facial weakness or falls triggered by joking or laughter (partial or complete cataplexy), or the inability to move for one or two minutes immediately after awakening or just before falling asleep. While cataplexy should prompt immediate consideration of narcolepsy, other symptoms are less specific, including complaints of daytime sleepiness or hallucinations that occur as the patient is falling asleep or awakening. Patients with narcolepsy type 2 do not have cataplexy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>].</p><p>In young children, the initial clinical presentation of narcolepsy type 1 can include an abrupt increase in 24-hour total sleep time and generalized hypotonia (persistent cataplexy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. Over time, a more classic form of cataplexy emerges, and 24-hour sleep time returns to more age-appropriate levels. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=narcolepsy-in-children#H31532825\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Narcolepsy in children&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23311070\"><span class=\"h2\">Daytime sleepiness</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All patients with narcolepsy have chronic sleepiness, but they do not sleep more than healthy individuals during a 24-hour period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/90,91\" class=\"abstract_t\">90,91</a>]. They are prone to fall asleep throughout the day, often at inappropriate times. The sleepiness may be so severe that patients with narcolepsy can doze off with little warning; these episodes are commonly referred to as &quot;sleep attacks.&quot; Sleepiness associated with narcolepsy usually improves temporarily after a brief nap, and most patients feel rested when they awake in the morning. Patients with narcolepsy typically have Epworth Sleepiness Scale scores &gt;15 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SLEEP%2F77101\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77101 \">table 1</a>) (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-epworth-sleepiness-scale-ess-in-adults\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/92,93\" class=\"abstract_t\">92,93</a>].

Episodes may also be triggered by anger or grief in some individuals. Cataplexy develops within three to five years of the onset of sleepiness in 60 percent of people with narcolepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>].</p><p>The muscle weakness is often partial, affecting the face, neck, and knees.

Sometimes, the weakness can have an atypical appearance with persistent generalized weakness plus facial grimacing, tremor, or tongue protrusion, especially in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/89,95\" class=\"abstract_t\">89,95</a>]. Consciousness remains intact during cataplexy, and the weakness usually resolves in less than two minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/96,97\" class=\"abstract_t\">96,97</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8510467\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypnagogic hallucinations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypnagogic hallucinations are vivid, often frightening visual, tactile, or auditory hallucinations that occur as the patient is falling asleep. They probably result from a mixture of wakefulness and the dreaming of rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Hypnopompic hallucinations are similar hallucinations that occur upon awakening; they can also occur in narcolepsy, but are less common. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-the-patient-with-visual-hallucinations#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to the patient with visual hallucinations&quot;, section on 'Narcolepsy'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8510474\"><span class=\"h2\">Sleep paralysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Sleep paralysis is the complete inability to move for one or two minutes immediately after awakening. It may also occur just before falling asleep. Episodes of sleep paralysis can be frightening because the immobility may be accompanied by hypnopompic hallucinations or a sensation of suffocation. The feeling of suffocation may be related to slight reductions in tidal volume that occur during sleep paralysis. Sleep paralysis can be distinguished from cataplexy because sleep paralysis occurs upon awakening, while cataplexy is triggered by positive emotions.</p><p>Sleep paralysis and hypnagogic hallucinations are common in patients with narcolepsy but not specific for the diagnosis. Isolated sleep paralysis can occur in association with insufficient sleep, irregular sleep-wake schedules, or as a rebound phenomenon after withdrawal of REM sleep-suppressing medications or substances. About 20 percent of the general population have a rare episode of sleep paralysis, perhaps once or twice over several years, but people with narcolepsy tend to have these symptoms much more frequently.

This was illustrated by a single-center clinical and polysomnographic study that included 100 consecutive patients with narcolepsy, in which the most common comorbid sleep disorders were insomnia (28 percent), REM sleep behavior disorder (24 percent), restless legs syndrome (24 percent), obstructive sleep apnea (21 percent), and non-REM sleep parasomnias (10 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-narcolepsy-in-adults/abstract/104\" class=\"abstract_t\">104</a>].

The purpose of the multiple sleep latency test is to measure the mean sleep latency and identify sleep onset rapid eye movement periods (SOREMPs).

The patient is placed in a sleep-inducing environment (ie, dark, quiet room) and instructed to try to sleep. Monitoring includes electroencephalography (EEG), electrooculography, mental or submental electromyography, and electrocardiography (ECG). Each nap session continues for 15 minutes after sleep onset to detect REM sleep. The sleep latency is documented for each nap session. If the patient does not fall asleep, the nap session is terminated after 20 minutes and the sleep latency is documented as being 20 minutes.

These include insufficient sleep, obstructive sleep apnea, central sleep apnea, periodic limb movements, circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorders (eg, rotating shift work), mood disorders, and idiopathic hypersomnia. It is common for more than one such condition to exist.

In patients with delayed sleep phase disorder, a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) performed first thing in the morning may show an increased number of sleep-onset REM periods (SOREMPs) even after six hours of sleep the night before. Similarly, uncorrected sleep deprivation may result in an increased number of SOREMPs on an MSLT that are not specific for a diagnosis of narcolepsy.
