It is thought to be due primarily to cerebral edema.</p><p>This topic reviews DDS. Issues related to mental status changes and other acute problems during dialysis are presented separately.

Most reports state that the incidence has declined [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-disequilibrium-syndrome/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. Severe DDS is now rare in adults because of the standard use of the preventive recommendations made below (see <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Prevention'</a> below). Another possible reason for the decreased incidence is that patients are generally initiated on dialysis at a much lower blood urea concentration than previously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-disequilibrium-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, some reports suggest that the syndrome is underreported because of the broad spectrum of manifestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-disequilibrium-syndrome/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Less severe symptoms (such as muscle cramps and dizziness) may reflect DDS but are often not reported.</p><p>Risk factors for DDS include the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-disequilibrium-syndrome/abstract/2-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>First dialysis treatment</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Markedly elevated blood urea concentration predialysis (ie, &gt;175 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> or 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic kidney disease (CKD, as compared with acute kidney injury [AKI])</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe metabolic acidosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Older age</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pediatric patients</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pre-existing neurologic disease (head trauma, stroke, seizure disorder)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Other conditions characterized by cerebral edema (hyponatremia, hepatic encephalopathy, malignant hypertension)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any condition that increases permeability of the blood-brain barrier (such as sepsis, vasculitis, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura-hemolytic uremic syndrome <span class=\"nowrap\">[TTP/HUS],</span> encephalitis, or meningitis)</p><p/><p>Some reports suggested that the risk of DDS was lower among patients undergoing less efficient renal replacement therapies, such as continuous renal replacement therapies (CRRTs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-disequilibrium-syndrome/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>] or peritoneal dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-disequilibrium-syndrome/abstract/2,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8</a>]. However, DDS has been reported among patients undergoing CRRT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-disequilibrium-syndrome/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. In a randomized study that compared high-intensity with low-intensity CRRT among 1490 patients, three developed DDS and one developed cerebral edema (all in the high-intensity group) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-disequilibrium-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>DDS has not been reported with continuous peritoneal dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-disequilibrium-syndrome/abstract/2,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms of DDS are caused by water movement into the brain, leading to cerebral edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-disequilibrium-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Two theories have been proposed to explain why this occurs: a reverse osmotic shift induced by urea removal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-disequilibrium-syndrome/abstract/1,11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,11-13</a>] and a fall in cerebral intracellular pH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-disequilibrium-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Reverse osmotic shift</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hemodialysis rapidly removes small solutes such as urea, particularly in patients who have marked azotemia. The reduction in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) lowers the plasma osmolality, thereby creating a transient osmotic gradient that promotes water movement into the cells. In the brain, this water shift produces cerebral edema and a variable degree of acute neurologic dysfunction.</p><p>The pathogenetic importance of urea in DDS has been demonstrated by experiments in uremic rats [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-disequilibrium-syndrome/abstract/11-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-13</a>]. In one report, for example, rapid dialysis lowered the BUN from 200 to 95 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (72 to 34 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span> in 90 minutes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-disequilibrium-syndrome/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This change was associated with a 6 percent increase in brain water. Neither undialyzed rats nor those rats dialyzed against a bath to which urea was added to prevent a fall in BUN developed cerebral edema. Furthermore, the retention of brain urea appears to account for most of the increase in brain water [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-disequilibrium-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Urea is generally considered an &quot;ineffective&quot; osmole because of its ability to permeate cell membranes. However, this effect may take several hours to reach completion. Thus, there is insufficient time for urea equilibration when hemodialysis rapidly reduces the BUN; as a result, urea transiently acts as an effective osmole, promoting water movement into the brain. In the above experiments, for example, the 53 percent acute reduction in BUN was only associated with a 13 percent reduction in brain urea nitrogen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-disequilibrium-syndrome/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In addition, animal studies have suggested that there may be a decrease in urea transporters and an increase in water channels in uremia, which would increase the reflection coefficient (or ability to elicit an osmotic force) of urea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-disequilibrium-syndrome/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Intracerebral acidosis and idiogenic osmoles</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some investigators have suggested that the reverse osmotic shift cannot account for the development of cerebral edema in DDS, since urea movement out of the brain is sufficiently rapid to prevent a large osmotic gradient between the brain and extracellular fluid [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-disequilibrium-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. They have proposed that a decrease in cerebral intracellular pH, occurring via an uncertain mechanism, is of primary importance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-disequilibrium-syndrome/abstract/2,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,13</a>]. Both displacement of bound sodium and potassium by the excess hydrogen ions and enhanced production of organic acids can increase intracellular osmolality and promote water movement into the brain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-disequilibrium-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>However, an increase in brain organic osmolytes has not been confirmed in all studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-disequilibrium-syndrome/abstract/12,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,16</a>]. In most reports, the reverse osmotic shift appears sufficient to explain most of dialysis disequilibrium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-disequilibrium-syndrome/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The signs and symptoms of DDS usually develop during or immediately after hemodialysis or during the initiation of a continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-disequilibrium-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Early symptoms include headache, nausea, disorientation, restlessness, blurred vision, and asterixis. In general, symptoms of DDS are self-limited and usually dissipate within several hours. Some patients, however, may progress to confusion, seizures, coma, and even death.</p><p>Many milder signs and symptoms associated with dialysis, such as muscle cramps, anorexia, and dizziness, which develop near the end of a dialysis treatment, may also be part of this syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-disequilibrium-syndrome/abstract/2,15,17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,15,17-20</a>].</p><p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) manifestations have been described in a small number of patients with DDS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-disequilibrium-syndrome/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS AND DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The development of neurologic symptoms during dialysis suggests DDS. However, there is no diagnostic test for DDS, and the diagnosis is one of exclusion. Other disorders that must be excluded include uremia itself, subdural hematoma, cerebral infarction, intracerebral hemorrhage, meningitis, metabolic disturbances (hyponatremia, hypoglycemia), and drug-induced encephalopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-disequilibrium-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Drug accumulation is a particular problem in renal failure with drugs that are normally excreted by the kidney.</p><p>The extent to which each of these conditions is evaluated depends upon the presenting symptoms. Patients who present with an altered mental status during the course of dialysis treatment should have serum electrolytes, calcium, and glucose determined to exclude <span class=\"nowrap\">hypo/hyperglycemia,</span> <span class=\"nowrap\">hypo/hypernatremia,</span> or <span class=\"nowrap\">hypo/hypercalcemia</span>. Infections should be excluded with physical examination, chest radiograph, and blood and urine cultures.

In patients who are at high risk for DDS and who develop such symptoms while undergoing dialysis, the blood flow rate should be slowed and consideration should be given to stopping the dialysis session [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-disequilibrium-syndrome/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p>Dialysis should be immediately stopped if the patient develops seizures, coma, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> obtundation.

In this setting, causes of these symptoms other than severe DDS should be considered. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis and differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p>Some studies have suggested that severe DDS with seizures can be reversed more rapidly by raising the plasma osmolality with either 5 mL of 23 percent saline or 12.5 g of hypertonic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mannitol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mannitol</a>. However, both maneuvers may be ineffective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/dialysis-disequilibrium-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], and we do not advocate using either hypertonic saline or mannitol for the treatment of presumed DDS, although some clinicians may still use one of these as treatments if severe symptoms persist after stopping dialysis. Once DDS appears to have been established, full supportive therapy and repeated, frequent short dialysis treatments are accepted practice. Many dialysis units and hospitals have eliminated use of mannitol and 23 percent saline for safety reasons. In general, supportive care, as described above, is considered standard of care.

Severe DDS is uncommon since patients are generally started on dialysis at lower blood urea nitrogen concentrations (BUN) and since measures to prevent DDS are standard protocol at most centers. (See <a href=\"#H370510147\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology and risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>New patients who are just being started on intermittent hemodialysis are at greatest risk for DDS, particularly if the BUN is markedly elevated (&gt;175 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> or 60 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/L)</span>. Other predisposing factors include severe metabolic acidosis, older age, pediatric patients, and pre-existing neurologic conditions (such as head trauma, stroke, or seizure disorder), or other conditions that are associated with cerebral edema (such as hyponatremia, hepatic encephalopathy, and malignant hypertension).
