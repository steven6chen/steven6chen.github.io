General issues related to lung cancer risk and its clinical presentation are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cigarette-smoking-and-other-possible-risk-factors-for-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cigarette smoking and other possible risk factors for lung cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-risk-factors-pathology-and-clinical-manifestations-of-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the risk factors, pathology, and clinical manifestations of lung cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Worldwide, lung cancer is the third most common cancer in women, behind breast and colorectal cancers, accounting for 580,000 cases and 490,000 deaths in 2012 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/women-and-lung-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In the United States, lung cancer is now the leading cancer killer of women, having surpassed breast cancer in 1987 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F82580\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82580 \">table 1</a>). Almost twice as many women in the United States are expected to die from lung cancer compared with breast cancer in 2018 (approximately 70,000 versus 41,000) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/women-and-lung-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The age-adjusted lung cancer death rate has risen in parallel to the smoking rate among women, with the increase in lung cancer deaths following the increase in smoking incidence by approximately 20 years. This separation reflects the latency period between smoking and death from lung cancer. Specifically, the smoking rate for women rose dramatically in the United States from 1930 to 1960, and this was followed by a rapidly increasing lung cancer death rate that began in 1960 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F58335\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58335 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/women-and-lung-cancer/abstract/3-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-7</a>]. The lung cancer death rate in women has reached a plateau and has now started to decline with a reported decrease of 1.1 percent per year from 2003 to 2009 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/women-and-lung-cancer/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The same trend has been documented in many European countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/women-and-lung-cancer/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Comparison of men and women</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lung cancer mortality has been and continues to be more common in men than women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/women-and-lung-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, the magnitude of this difference continues to decline due to increases in the female lung cancer mortality rate while the mortality rate in males has decreased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/women-and-lung-cancer/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p>The age-adjusted lung cancer incidence continues to be higher in men than women. However, the magnitude of this difference has decreased, which reflects the fact that the female incidence rate is stabilizing while the male incidence rate continues to decrease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/women-and-lung-cancer/abstract/5,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,10,11</a>].</p><p>A notable exception to these trends exists among never smokers. In this population, the age-adjusted incidence rate of lung cancer is higher for women (14.4 to 20.8 per 100,000 person-years) than men (4.8 to 13.7 per 100,000 person-years) according to a pooled analysis of six prospective cohort studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/women-and-lung-cancer/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Furthermore, in the United States, approximately 19 percent of lung cancer in women arises in never smokers compared to only 9 percent for men. However, there is no clear evidence that lung cancer in never smoking young women is increasing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/women-and-lung-cancer/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-cancer-in-never-smokers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lung cancer in never smokers&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given that smoking is the most important risk factor for the development of lung cancer in both women and men, the question arises whether there is a gender-related difference in the magnitude of the relationship between smoking and lung cancer. An additional question is whether endocrine factors affect the risk of lung cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Tobacco exposure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cigarette smoking is the main culprit for the lung cancer epidemic in women, with estimates suggesting up to 80 percent of lung cancer cases in women are related to smoking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/women-and-lung-cancer/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Women started smoking in significant numbers during and following World War II. Although smoking rates have declined since their peak in the 1960s, the current prevalence of smoking among women in the United States is still too high with an estimated 16.5 percent of women smoking in 2011 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F65613\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65613 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/women-and-lung-cancer/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cigarette-smoking-and-other-possible-risk-factors-for-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cigarette smoking and other possible risk factors for lung cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Reported relative risks (RR) for the development of lung cancer in women smokers compared to women non-smokers vary greatly. RRs from recent reports range from 7.8 to 37.5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/women-and-lung-cancer/abstract/17-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-22</a>]. Furthermore, the magnitude of the risk increases with the duration of smoking and with the total exposure to cigarettes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/women-and-lung-cancer/abstract/15,21,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,21,23</a>]. The risk in women who are former smokers remains significantly elevated compared with never smokers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/women-and-lung-cancer/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Passive smoking may also be associated with increased risk of lung cancer in never smokers, although the increased risk appears to be predominantly in women with prolonged exposure as an adult [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/women-and-lung-cancer/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lung-cancer-in-never-smokers#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lung cancer in never smokers&quot;, section on 'Secondhand smoke'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secondhand-smoke-exposure-effects-in-adults#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Secondhand smoke exposure: Effects in adults&quot;, section on 'Lung cancer'</a>.)</p><p>Although prior case-control reports suggested women smokers may have a higher relative risk of developing lung cancer than men smokers, more recent evidence indicates that the strength of the association between smoking and lung cancer is similar for men and women for a given level of exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/women-and-lung-cancer/abstract/24-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-27</a>]. Lung cancer is not the only smoking-related tragedy in women. The World Health Organization (WHO) showed that at least 25 percent of women smokers die from a smoking-related disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/women-and-lung-cancer/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In absolute numbers, approximately 300,000 women in developed countries died of smoking-related diseases in 1985. The most important smoking-related causes of death were cardiovascular disease (41 percent), lung cancer (21 percent), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (18 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/women-and-lung-cancer/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Other causes include cancers of the esophagus, head and neck, and other sites, as well as other respiratory diseases. </p><p>A more recent report estimated that in 2000 there were 4.83 million deaths in the world due to smoking with an even split between industrialized and non-industrialized countries. About one million of these deaths were in women, and the principal causes of death remained cardiovascular disease, lung cancer, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/women-and-lung-cancer/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

The incidence of lung cancer is markedly increased in women who have smoked and have received radiation therapy following mastectomy for breast cancer compared to those who never smoked and did not receive post-mastectomy RT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/women-and-lung-cancer/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].

On the one hand, the incidence may be reduced given that smaller volumes of normal tissue receive high doses with these modern conformal techniques. The risk of second cancers could be increased with the use of IMRT and protons due to the fact that larger volumes of normal tissue receive very low doses with such techniques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/women-and-lung-cancer/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Endocrine factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Large randomized studies suggest that estrogen plus progestin therapy is associated with an increased risk of lung cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/women-and-lung-cancer/abstract/38-40\" class=\"abstract_t\">38-40</a>].

In a post-hoc analysis, there was no statistically significant increase in the incidence of lung cancer after a mean follow-up of eight years (HR for incidence 1.17, 95% CI 0.81-1.69) nor was there an increase in deaths from lung cancer (HR for death 1.07, 95% CI 0.66-1.72).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prospective Vitamins and Lifestyle (VITAL) Study followed a cohort of over 36,000 peri- and postmenopausal women during six years of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/women-and-lung-cancer/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].

Adenocarcinoma has replaced squamous cell carcinoma as the most common histologic type for both men and women, but proportionally more women than men are diagnosed with adenocarcinoma, and more men than women are diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/women-and-lung-cancer/abstract/11,20,21,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,20,21,52</a>].</p><p>A contemporary population-based case-control study of 4220 people in Italy demonstrated that among women diagnosed with lung cancer, the histologic sub-types were adenocarcinoma for 54 percent and squamous cell carcinoma for 11 percent compared to 38 and 30 percent, respectively, for men diagnosed with lung cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/women-and-lung-cancer/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Similar results were reported based on the US National Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database. Histologic sub-types of lung cancer for 228,572 people diagnosed between 1975 and 1999 showed rates of adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma of 45 and 21 percent for women, compared with 33 and 36 percent for men [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/women-and-lung-cancer/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Furthermore, rates of all lung cancer types in women and adenocarcinoma in men continue to rise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/women-and-lung-cancer/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. </p><p>Part of the explanation for differing distributions of lung cancer histology as well as different lung cancer biologies for men and women could be due to gender-related different susceptibilities to various molecular aberrations caused by smoking or other potential carcinogens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/women-and-lung-cancer/abstract/20,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,54</a>]. There may also be differences in somatic gene mutations between the genders.

Smoking prevalence rates for men and women in the United States have decreased since their peaks in the 1960s.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-advanced-non-small-cell-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=personalized-genotype-directed-therapy-for-advanced-non-small-cell-lung-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Personalized, genotype-directed therapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Preclinical and clinical trials should continue to be supported, and gender should be addressed as a specific research variable. Women should be actively recruited for enrollment in lung cancer clinical trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/women-and-lung-cancer/abstract/14,47,67\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,47,67</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lung cancer has reached epidemic proportions in women, and it is now the leading cancer killer in women as well as men. The vast majority of lung cancer cases are attributable to smoking, and smoking prevalence rates in women are still unacceptably high.</p><p>It is unresolved whether etiologic factors contributing to lung cancer differ in women and men, but there do appear to be some distinctions. The magnitude of the effect of smoking on the risk of developing the disease may not be different across the genders, but smoking appears to have an impact on the histology of lung cancer.</p><p>Finally, although the evidence is not entirely clear, endocrine factors may influence both the development of lung cancer and its subsequent natural history. Consideration should be given to discontinuing postmenopausal hormone therapy in women diagnosed with lung cancer.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/women-and-lung-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Torre LA, Bray F, Siegel RL, et al.
