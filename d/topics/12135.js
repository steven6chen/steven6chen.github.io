Many techniques have been used for hernia repair, and these can be categorized as tension-free repairs, which typically use mesh, and primary tissue approximation repairs that do not use mesh. The most commonly used open approaches include the Lichtenstein repair; the plug and patch repair; and the open, preperitoneal approach. When performed by surgeons with experience with the technique, each of these techniques is associated with low recurrence rates.</p><p>Open techniques for the repair of inguinal and femoral hernia are reviewed here. The classification and diagnosis of inguinal and femoral hernias, management of inguinal and femoral hernia, and laparoscopic techniques for inguinal and femoral hernia repair are discussed elsewhere.

The inguinal canal is formed by the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle anteriorly and the transversalis fascia and the transversus abdominis muscles posteriorly. The external inguinal ring is formed by the external oblique muscle. The internal inguinal ring is located in the transversalis fascia. The iliac vessels exit the abdomen posterior to the inguinal canal. The anatomy of the abdominal wall is discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anatomy-of-the-abdominal-wall\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anatomy of the abdominal wall&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1919655\"><span class=\"h2\">Hernia location</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Indirect inguinal hernias develop at the internal ring, the site at which the spermatic cord in males and the round ligament in females enter the inguinal canal. Indirect inguinal hernias originate lateral to the inferior epigastric artery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F61841%7ESURG%2F65264\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61841 graphicRef65264 \">figure 1A-B</a>), in contrast to direct hernias (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F83248\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83248 \">figure 2</a>), which protrude through Hesselbach's triangle medial to the inferior epigastric vessels. Hesselbach's triangle is bounded by the rectus abdominis muscle medially, the inguinal ligament inferiorly, and the inferior epigastric vessels laterally.</p><p>Femoral hernias (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F73484\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73484 \">figure 3</a>) protrude through the femoral ring, which is bounded by the inguinal ligament anteriorly, the pectineus fascia posteriorly, the lacunar ligament medially, and the sheath of the femoral vein laterally.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1919626\"><span class=\"h2\">Nerves of the groin region</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The iliohypogastric, ilioinguinal, and genital branches of the genitofemoral nerves are encountered during anterior, open hernia repair (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F61841\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef61841 \">figure 1A</a>)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ilioinguinal nerve can be identified as it passes between the external and internal oblique muscles and across the arching fibers of the internal oblique before joining the other cord structures. This location makes it prone to entrapment during mesh fixation laterally. The ilioinguinal nerve may also be injured more medially along the cord during incision of the external oblique or dissection of an indirect hernia sac. Freeing the nerve from the spermatic cord and retracting it may help protect it. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The iliohypogastric nerve enters the groin, as does the ilioinguinal nerve, from between the external and internal oblique muscles. These two nerves can share elements and are variable in size. This nerve passes cephalad to the spermatic cord and crosses the conjoined tendon as it progresses medially. If the iliohypogastric nerve appears absent, it may be hidden within the fibers of the internal oblique muscle. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The genital branch of the genitofemoral nerve, the third nerve in this area and the only one that accompanies the other cord structures through the internal ring, is behind the cord out of the usual area of dissection and out of harm's way.

The Lichtenstein technique is perhaps the most versatile, is easy to master, and is associated with a reliably low incidence of recurrent hernia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-repair-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults/abstract/7,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,23</a>]. </p><p>For large scrotal inguinal hernias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-repair-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>], hernias following major lower abdominal surgery, and when general anaesthesia is not feasible, the Lichtenstein repair is also our preferred surgical technique.</p><p>Prior to the introduction of tension-free hernia repairs, bilateral inguinal hernia was repaired one side at a time to avoid increased tension and high recurrence rates. This teaching lingers in many circles today, leading some to conclude that bilaterality is one of the few absolute indications for laparoscopic repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-repair-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. However, this teaching has no basis in fact, and the approach should be individualized based upon patient and surgeon factors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1918945\"><span class=\"h3\">Incarcerated or strangulated inguinal hernia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The use of mesh for repair of complicated inguinal hernia (incarcerated, strangulated) may increase the risk for subsequent mesh infection. If the use of mesh is deemed safe in a patient who presents with incarcerated or strangulated <strong>inguinal</strong> hernia, we suggest a Lichtenstein repair, rather than a laparoscopic repair, although a laparoscopic approach has been used. (See <a href=\"#H28361800\" class=\"local\">'Indications for open repair'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-treatment-for-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults#H345988931\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of treatment for inguinal and femoral hernia in adults&quot;, section on 'Patients with complicated hernia'</a>.)</p><p>When mesh is contraindicated, we suggest a Shouldice repair or a Bassini repair with a McVay relaxing incision for inguinal hernias. Many surgeons use a similar approach when treating patients who require bowel resection for an incarcerated or strangulated hernia to minimize the risk of subsequent mesh infection. </p><p>Whether or not to avoid use of mesh for all circumstances of complicated inguinal hernia is controversial. Several reviews have reported acceptable outcomes for mesh repair of complicated hernia. A systematic review identified two randomized trials comparing the use of mesh versus a non-mesh technique for the repair of strangulated hernias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-repair-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. In the first of these trials, 54 patients with strangulated inguinal hernia were randomly assigned to tension-free mesh repair (Lichtenstein) or repair using a Bassini technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-repair-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Mesh hernioplasty was not attempted in patients with preoperative peritonitis, inflammatory hernia, or for those in whom bowel resection was performed for ischemic necrosis as a result of strangulated hernia. The incidence of surgical complications did not differ significantly between the groups, but postoperative hospital stay was significantly longer in those who underwent mesh compared with non-mesh repair (five versus three days). Over a mean follow-up period of 22 months, no hernia recurrences occurred in the Lichtenstein repair group, compared with three in the Bassini repair group. In the second trial, 42 patients with strangulated inguinal hernia were randomly assigned to preperitoneal mesh or Lichtenstein mesh repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-repair-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Throughout the study period, there were no complications related to the presence of the mesh, and no recurrences were encountered in either group. A separate review reported no significant difference in outcomes for repair of acutely or chronically strangulated hernia using a laparoscopic technique (transabdominal preperitoneal [TAPP] repair) compared with TAPP repair for reducible hernias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-repair-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Thus, mesh repair techniques appear to be safe for the repair of complicated hernias provided the tissues appear normal or only mildly edematous [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-repair-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>]. Profound edema <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dusky tissue are relative contraindications to the use of mesh, even if the tissue regains a normal color with observation.

But, because the anatomy of recurrent hernias is highly variable, innovative hybrid procedures are commonly used. The options are more varied when the original repair included mesh. If the recurrence is limited to a small, 1- to 2-centimeter defect, as is sometimes seen next to the pubic tubercle, a plug and patch repair can be used. If multiple direct defects are found, the fibrous bridges between should be transected, providing access for an open, bilayer mesh preperitoneal repair. (See <a href=\"#H788787\" class=\"local\">'Bilayer mesh repair'</a> below.) </p><p>A preperitoneal repair can be used when a direct hernia involves the entire floor of the canal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-repair-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. We avoid taking down or destroying portions of the previous repair that are intact, except in the case of multiple defects. If the recurrence is indirect, a high ligation of the sac is performed. Alternatively, the indirect sac can be freed and reduced into the preperitoneal space without high ligation, and the ring can be narrowed in Lichtenstein fashion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1921398\"><span class=\"h1\">PREOPERATIVE EVALUATION AND PREPARATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Preoperative evaluation and preparation prior to inguinal and femoral hernia repair, including thromboprophylaxis, prophylactic antibiotics, initial management of complicated hernia, and choice of anesthesia, is discussed in detail elsewhere.

(See <a href=\"#H1920075\" class=\"local\">'Hernia repair techniques'</a> below and <a href=\"#H7688030\" class=\"local\">'Approach to complicated hernias'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7687948\"><span class=\"h2\">Incision and exposure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The groin incision should be of adequate length to provide exposure for the specific type of repair. Incisions for specific repairs are discussed below. The incision for an open repair, although longer than the incisions for laparoscopic repairs, may be more cosmetically appealing since it is entirely below the &quot;bikini line&quot; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F51599\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51599 \">figure 5</a>). &#160; </p><p>Once the incision has been made, the groin is explored to identify the hernia. If operative exploration of the internal inguinal ring and Hesselbach's triangle fails to identify an inguinal hernia, the preperitoneal space should be explored to allow inspection of the femoral canal. This can be accomplished by incising the transversalis fascia over Hesselbach's triangle.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7687954\"><span class=\"h2\">Mobilizing the hernia sac</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hernia sac is mobilized from surrounding structures. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indirect hernia &ndash; The indirect sac is normally mobilized from the adjacent cord structures. Indirect inguinal hernia sacs are frequently much more intimately attached to the round ligament in women than are indirect sacs to the cord structures in males. In the case of large indirect hernia sacs, the distal elements of the sac can be left in place to prevent ischemic orchitis associated with damage to the spermatic structures that can occur with excessive dissection; however, this sometimes leads to hydrocele formation. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Direct hernia &ndash; Direct hernia sacs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F83248\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83248 \">figure 2</a>) usually have a broader base compared with indirect hernia sacs.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7687960\"><span class=\"h2\">Hernia repair</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Once the hernia has been mobilized and the sac separated from surrounding structures and reduced, tissue repair is accomplished using one of the specific hernia repair techniques. The main principle of inguinal hernia repair is to reinforce the floor of the inguinal canal and, for men, to tighten the internal inguinal ring without creating undue tension on the repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-repair-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults/abstract/10,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,46</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H279399894\" class=\"local\">'Mesh versus non-mesh repair'</a> above.)</p><p>Macroporous polypropylene meshes are preferred to other prosthetic materials. These products have large pores (&gt;75 micrometers) allowing permeation of the material with fibroblasts, collagen fibers, new blood vessels, and macrophages, all of which are essential for creating a strong repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-repair-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Microporous materials, which have pores &lt;10 micrometers, do not promote a sufficient inflammatory response and also do not provide sufficient tissue incorporation for a strong repair. Lightweight monofilament materials are generally preferable since they are pliable and more easily sterilized in cases involving postoperative infections. Lightweight meshes may also have some advantages with respect to long-term discomfort and foreign body sensation in open hernia repair. </p><p>Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses have compared heavy versus lightweight mesh [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-repair-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults/abstract/48-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-50</a>]. The risk of chronic pain was significantly less for lightweight mesh. The magnitude of risk reduction was similar in each of the meta-analyses (eg, odds ratio [OR] 0.61, 95% CI 0.50-0.74) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-repair-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Patients reported significantly less of a foreign body sensation for the lightweight mesh regardless of whether the mesh was partially absorbable or nonabsorbable. No significant differences were identified for postoperative complications such as seroma, hematoma, wound infection, urine retention, and testicular atrophy or hernia recurrence. </p><p>In resource-limited settings, low-cost alternatives to commercial meshes have been used to repair groin hernias with good clinical outcomes. As an example, in a randomized trial conducted in Uganda, open groin hernia repairs using a mesh made from sterilized mosquito netting resulted in similar rates of hernia recurrences (0.7 versus 0 percent) and postoperative complications (31 versus 30 percent) compared with surgery performed with commercial mesh [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-repair-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. The low-cost mesh used in this study was a lightweight macroporous material made from polyethylene. When prepared and sterilized at the local surgical facility, the cost of the mesh was less than 1 US dollar, which is substantially less expensive than a commercial mesh (125 US dollars).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7687701\"><span class=\"h3\">Mesh fixation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Permanent mesh fixation using sutures or tacking devices is common. However, the increasing prevalence of post-herniorrhaphy neuralgia has stimulated interest in finding alternative methods with the intention of reducing the potential for persistent postoperative pain. These include absorbable suture and various sutureless techniques, such as self-fixing mesh and tissue glue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-repair-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults/abstract/52-61\" class=\"abstract_t\">52-61</a>]. </p><p>A systematic review identified six trials and two prospective studies comparing self-fixing and conventional mesh for Lichtenstein inguinal hernia repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-repair-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. No significant differences were identified in the incidence of chronic pain, acute postoperative pain, hematoma or seroma, wound infection, or recurrence. The self-gripping mesh group was associated with a minor reduction in operating time (one to nine minutes). A later trial comparing self-gripping mesh with sutured lightweight mesh found improved early postoperative pain scores for the self-gripping mesh but no reduction in chronic pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-repair-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].</p><p>A meta-analysis of eight trials found a significantly reduced incidence of chronic pain with glue fixation compared with suture fixation (relative risk 0.46, 95% CI 0.22-0.97) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-repair-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].

Neuralgia can be due to injury or entrapment of any of the named sensory nerves that innervate the groin, including the ilioinguinal, iliohypogastric, genital branch of the genitofemoral, and the lateral femoral cutaneous nerves (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F82895\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef82895 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-repair-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. The ilioinguinal and genitofemoral nerves are most commonly injured or entrapped during open hernia repair. The type of mesh used and the method of fixation are implicated as potential causes of persistent groin pain and post-herniorrhaphy neuralgia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-repair-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>].

Infiltration of the wound with a local anaesthetic results in less postoperative pain following inguinal hernia surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-repair-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1920075\"><span class=\"h1\">HERNIA REPAIR TECHNIQUES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H536308387\"><span class=\"h2\">Mesh repairs</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The two most common open tension-free mesh repairs are the Lichtenstein repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-repair-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>] and the &quot;plug and patch&quot; repair, each of which places the mesh anterior to the hernia defect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-repair-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults/abstract/81,82\" class=\"abstract_t\">81,82</a>]. By contrast, the Kugel repair places the mesh in a preperitoneal position [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-repair-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>].

However, the Lichtenstein repair is not applicable to femoral hernias since it does not cover the femoral ring. &#160;</p><p>To obtain exposure for Lichtenstein inguinal hernia repair: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Incise the skin over the inguinal canal and angle slightly cephalad as the incision progresses laterally (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F51599\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51599 \">figure 5</a>). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Divide the subcutaneous layer and ligate the superficial epigastric vein. Sharply dissect the subcutaneous tissue from the external oblique aponeurosis to expose the external inguinal ring. Incise the aponeurosis of the external oblique muscle in the direction of its fibers extending laterally from the external inguinal ring. Take care to protect the ilioinguinal nerve, which frequently lies in proximity to the undersurface of the external oblique muscle in this area. The incision should expose the internal oblique muscle as it engages the inguinal ligament laterally, which allows clear identification of the ilioinguinal nerve between the internal and external oblique muscles before it joins the other cord structures more medially. This facilitates protection of the nerve during mesh placement and also provides exposure for the fixation of mesh laterally.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In men, dissect the spermatic cord from the underlying transversalis fascia in the region of Hesselbach's triangle and retract it using a Penrose drain. In creating a window deep to the spermatic cord, protect the underlying transversalis fascia by working medially in the area of the pubic tubercle. Doing so will avoid loss of containment of bothersome preperitoneal fat and additionally facilitate repair should the hernia be of the direct type. In women, the procedure can be altered slightly by removing the segment of the round ligament lying within the inguinal canal along with the indirect hernia sac and by transecting and ligating the ilioinguinal nerve laterally. This eliminates the need to keyhole the mesh around the ligament and nerve. If a direct hernia is present and of sufficient size that it obscures the operative field, place a purse-string stitch at the base of the direct hernia in the transversalis fascia, invert the attenuated fascia, and tie the purse-string (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F82223\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82223 \">figure 6</a>). Reinforce the purse-string with a figure-of-eight stitch. This maneuver facilitates exposure during additional dissection and mesh placement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Explore the spermatic cord for an indirect hernia sac or cord lipoma. The cord should not be routinely &quot;skeletonized&quot; because testicular ischemia can result. Even so, removal of redundant cremaster and fat may be required to facilitate repair. Remove the indirect sac and close the peritoneum at the level of the internal ring. Alternatively, it is acceptable to free the sac at the internal ring and place it within the adjacent preperitoneal space. If the neck of the hernia sac neck is large, a running closure or purse-string suture may be needed. Smaller necks can be transfixed. Remove any cord lipomas or appendages of preperitoneal fat passing through the internal ring that extend along the cord structures. </p><p/><p>To perform a Lichtenstein hernia repair (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F82223\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82223 \">figure 6</a>): </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fashion a patch of polypropylene mesh to cover the inguinal region from a sheet of the chosen mesh product. The specific measurements depend upon the anatomy of the hernia. Tailor its shape and size to the patient's anatomy, leaving at least 2 cm of overlap on the pubic tubercle and anterior rectus sheath medially. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Suture the inferior margin of the mesh with a running nonabsorbable suture (eg, 2-0) to the shelving edge of the inguinal ligament. Start at the pubic tubercle medially and run it laterally to a point that is at least 1 cm lateral to the insertion of the internal oblique muscle into Poupart's ligament. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similarly, suture the superior margin of the mesh to the rectus sheath medially and internal oblique muscle laterally to the point at which the internal oblique meets the inguinal ligament. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Slit the lateral aspect of the mesh to encircle the spermatic cord, and reconstruct the internal ring by suturing the lower margin of the medial tail to the upper margin of the lateral tail and the inguinal ligament at a point lateral to the internal ring.

This &quot;new&quot; internal inguinal ring is slightly medial to the true internal ring, creating obliquity to the cord in the inguinal canal, which may help prevent recurrence of indirect hernias. In women, the procedure can be altered slightly by removing the segment of the round ligament lying within the inguinal canal and by transecting and ligating the ilioinguinal nerve.

In one report of 183 inguinal hernias repaired under local anesthesia, the recurrence rates for beginners (less than six repairs under local anesthesia) were significantly higher compared with those of experienced surgeons (9.4 versus 2.5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-repair-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. </p><p>This technique involves division of all of the layers of the floor of the inguinal canal and reduction of the hernia, followed by reconstruction of the inguinal canal with a four-layer overlap technique using continuous fine wire sutures to obliterate the hernia defect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-repair-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults/abstract/92\" class=\"abstract_t\">92</a>]. Because the defect is closed with multiple layers, none of them is placed under undue tension, according to reports. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14843460\"><span class=\"h3\">Desarda repair</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Desarda repair is a primary tissue repair that does not use mesh. A flap of the external oblique muscle aponeurosis is used to &quot;patch&quot; the defect in a manner similar to a Lichtenstein repair, but without prosthetic material. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Lichtenstein repair'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Bassini repair</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Bassini repair is a primary tissue approximation approach to inguinal hernia repair in which the weakened inguinal floor is strengthened by suturing the conjoined tendon to the inguinal ligament from the pubic tubercle medially to the area of the internal ring laterally. </p><p>The original operation was introduced in 1887 and was modified many times [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-repair-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>]. In the mid-20<sup>th</sup> century, a procedure based upon the original Bassini procedure was described by Shouldice. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Shouldice repair'</a> above.)</p><p>The Bassini repair is applicable to only inguinal hernias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-repair-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. It may be more frequently applied to those women who have a less strenuous lifestyle. With removal of the round ligament, the internal ring is totally obliterated. However, long-term recurrence rates associated with the Bassini repair have been high.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H20\"><span class=\"h3\">McVay repair</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The McVay repair can be used for the repair of inguinal or femoral hernias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-repair-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults/abstract/93\" class=\"abstract_t\">93</a>]. </p><p>The McVay repair is somewhat more technically challenging than the Bassini repair and involves incising the transversalis fascia in the region of Hesselbach's triangle to enter the preperitoneal space to expose the pectineal ligament (Cooper's ligament). The conjoined tendon is then sutured to Cooper's ligament from the pubic tubercle laterally as far as the vicinity of the femoral sheath as it crosses Cooper's ligament. At that point, a transition stitch is placed incorporating the conjoined tendon, Cooper's ligament, the femoral sheath at the medial aspect of the femoral vein, and the inguinal ligament (occasionally the femoral sheath cannot be identified and can be excluded). </p><p>The remainder of the inguinal floor is repaired by approximating the conjoined tendon to the inguinal ligament extending laterally to the area of the internal ring. This repair generates considerable tension and requires a relaxing incision. To do this, the anterior rectus sheath behind the external oblique aponeurosis should be exposed from the pubic tubercle cephalad for several centimeters, and it is then incised from the pubic tubercle extending cephalad for approximately 6 centimeters along the fusion of the external oblique aponeurosis with the sheath's other components. This type of relaxing incision can also be used with other non-mesh repairs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7688030\"><span class=\"h2\">Approach to complicated hernias</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7688036\"><span class=\"h3\">Sliding hernias</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If all contents of the sac cannot be reduced, adhesions of viscera to the sac or a sliding component may be present. </p><p>A sliding hernia is one in which a portion of the wall of the hernia sac is composed of the mesentery of viscera or viscera itself. The visceral component can be ovary, fallopian tube, cecum, appendix, sigmoid colon, bladder, ureter, or only the preperitoneal fat associated with any of these structures. When the cecum, terminal ileum, appendix, or sigmoid colon contributes to the sac, it presents laterally and posteriorly. The urinary bladder and ovary present as medial components of the sac. Ovaries frequently incarcerate without truly sliding. When a true slide is encountered, the sliding component must still be separated from the rest of the sac. When the appendix contributes as a sliding component of a hernia sac, we do not recommend removal of the appendix. </p><p>Sliding hernias are rarely direct except in the case of the urinary bladder. Direct sliding hernias require no special techniques, since the sac, including the sliding component, can be inverted behind a purse-string suture. </p><p>The essence of the repair of sliding indirect inguinal hernias is the peritonealization of the sliding component. Peritonealizing the extraperitoneal surface is not required as long as the base at the level of the internal ring is incorporated in the high ligation of the sac. Regardless of the size or source of the sliding component of the sac, the approach described below, a modification of either the Bevan or the LaRoque technique, is always applicable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-repair-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults/abstract/94-96\" class=\"abstract_t\">94-96</a>]. </p><p>The sliding hernia sac should be opened with caution (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F76206\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76206 \">figure 9</a>). The surface of the mesentery and enteric organ are covered with peritoneum and serosa, respectively, which will only be present inside the hernia sac. The outer surface, having been extraperitoneal prior to herniation, has no peritoneal or serosal layer. Once the hernia sac is entered, the serosalized surface of the sliding organ will be seen. The sliding component is separated from the rest of the sac, leaving a 1-centimeter circumferential cuff of adjacent sac attached, which will be used to peritonealize the extraperitoneal surface (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F76206\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76206 \">figure 9</a>). This peritonealization is accomplished by everting the cuff and approximating its everted margins edge-to-edge with a running suture beginning at the apex and continuing to the level of the internal ring. The sliding component is thereby totally peritonealized and ready to assume its intraperitoneal location (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F76206\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76206 \">figure 9</a>). The organ is reduced through the internal ring into the abdominal cavity. On rare occasions, ligation of the deep epigastric vessels <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> enlargement of the internal ring medially by incising the conjoined tendon may be required to accommodate a bulky sliding component. Alternatively, the conjoined tendon can be incised in a cephalad direction when necessary. Beginning at the termination of the previously completed peritonealizing suture, the remaining peritoneal defect is closed at the level of the internal ring while, at the same time, any remaining redundant sac is excised. The procedure is then completed in typical Lichtenstein fashion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7688059\"><span class=\"h3\">Incarcerated and strangulated hernias</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For incarcerated and strangulated inguinal hernias, the operating table can be placed in reverse Trendelenburg position during induction of anesthesia to decrease the likelihood that the hernia will reduce spontaneously. Should spontaneous reduction of the hernia occur in spite of this maneuver, the bowel will need to be inspected, which can typically be accomplished through the opened hernia sac. Alternatively, laparoscopy can be used to evaluate bowel viability. On laparoscopy, the presence of bloody fluid in the abdomen increases the suspicion of strangulated, gangrenous tissues. Although clear, yellow peritoneal fluid is reassuring, it<strong> </strong>does not rule out gangrene or adhesive obstruction. When intestinal gangrene is present, bowel resection and an anastomosis will be needed and can frequently be performed through the groin incision; however, if the groin incision does not provide adequate exposure, an abdominal exploration (open or laparoscopic) may be needed.</p><p>Occasionally, an incarcerated or strangulated femoral hernia cannot be reduced in spite of traction from above within the preperitoneal space and pressure from below the femoral ring on the anterior thigh. In such cases, the lacunar ligament can be incised to enlarge the femoral ring. If this is still not adequate, the inguinal ligament can be transected just above the femoral ring; however, this maneuver is rarely needed. Once the repair is completed, the inguinal ligament should be reapproximated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7688065\"><span class=\"h3\">Recurrent hernia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Open repair of recurrent hernia is most often performed in the context of a prior posterior repair (open or laparoscopic).</p><p>In the absence of infection, <strong>no</strong> effort should be made to identify or remove the prior mesh unless it interferes with the surgeon's ability to complete an adequate tension-free repair. In our experience, it is unlikely that the mesh from a prior posterior repair will be encountered. </p><p>Be aware that spiral tacks are sometimes used in laparoscopic repairs. These can be sharp and can cause injury if blunt finger dissection is used. If the tacks are encountered during dissection, remove each carefully by grasping the tack with a heavy needle driver or Kocher clamp and turning clockwise to rotate out of the tissue. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H791589983\"><span class=\"h1\">POSTOPERATIVE CARE AND FOLLOW-UP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following open inguinal or femoral hernia repair, postoperative care is individualized. </p><p>In general, the length of stay is dictated by comorbidities, complications, and the elective or emergent nature of the hernia. Elective cases are usually discharged the same day. Nausea and urinary retention are the most common problems that require an overnight stay.

However, many laparoscopic surgeons have equally good results, and recurrence rates for all types of repair are surgeon dependent. In the randomized trial of surgery versus watchful waiting, less than 2 percent of patients had a recurrence at two-year follow-up after an open mesh repair [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/open-surgical-repair-of-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>].

Open hernia repairs can be described as tension-free repairs that use mesh (hernioplasty), or as primary tissue approximation repairs (herniorrhaphy), which generally create tension. For tension-free repairs, equivalent surgical results can be obtained, regardless of approach, for surgeons experienced with the specific technique. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-treatment-for-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults#H744352\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of treatment for inguinal and femoral hernia in adults&quot;, section on 'Surgical techniques'</a> and <a href=\"#H279399894\" class=\"local\">'Mesh versus non-mesh repair'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When an open repair is chosen, our recommendations are as follows (see <a href=\"#H791243\" class=\"local\">'Choice of repair'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-treatment-for-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults#H1405881718\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of treatment for inguinal and femoral hernia in adults&quot;, section on 'Choosing a surgical approach'</a>): </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For initial repair of elective (uncomplicated) hernia, we recommend tension-free hernia repair, which typically requires the use of mesh, rather than repairs that are known to produce tension (ie, most primary approximation repairs) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). For complicated hernias, the approach depends upon whether there are contraindications to the placement of mesh. (See <a href=\"#H279399894\" class=\"local\">'Mesh versus non-mesh repair'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-treatment-for-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults#H744352\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of treatment for inguinal and femoral hernia in adults&quot;, section on 'Surgical techniques'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=wound-infection-following-repair-of-abdominal-wall-hernia#H4284985\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Wound infection following repair of abdominal wall hernia&quot;, section on 'Deep wound/mesh infection'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=recurrent-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Recurrent inguinal and femoral hernia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-treatment-for-inguinal-and-femoral-hernia-in-adults#H119427312\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of treatment for inguinal and femoral hernia in adults&quot;, section on 'Treat hernia complications if present'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Among the available open mesh repairs, we suggest the Lichtenstein repair for elective, uncomplicated <strong>inguinal</strong> hernia (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). The Lichtenstein repair has a low recurrence rate, can be technically mastered with ease, and can be performed in the outpatient setting using local anesthetic. Key elements of the Lichtenstein repair include avoiding tension on the mesh; crossing the tails of the mesh lateral to the cord; overlapping the pubic tubercle with the mesh; securing the mesh on all edges; and protection of the ilioinguinal, iliohypogastric, and genital nerves. (See <a href=\"#H1908616\" class=\"local\">'Elective inguinal hernia'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Lichtenstein repair'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The use of mesh for repair of complicated hernia (incarcerated, strangulated) may increase the risk for subsequent mesh infection, and thus, open hernia repair is generally suggested rather than laparoscopic repair (requires mesh). However, whether avoidance of mesh is mandatory under all circumstances is controversial. When the use of mesh is deemed safe in a patient who presents with incarcerated or strangulated <strong>inguinal</strong> hernia, we suggest a Lichtenstein repair (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). When mesh is contraindicated, we suggest a Bassini repair with a relaxing incision in the anterior rectus fascia for <strong>inguinal</strong> hernia (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>).
