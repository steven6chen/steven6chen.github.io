The reasons for this difference between medical and surgical patients are unclear but may be related to a greater number of comorbidities in medical patients that contribute to overall deaths. In addition, clinicians should be aware that VTE prophylaxis does not eliminate the risk of VTE or VTE-related death in hospitalized patients. &#160;</p><p>The risk of VTE in specific medical populations is discussed in this section, while the effect of thromboprophylaxis in these groups is described below.

Points were assigned to each factor identified to give a total risk score for each patient. During hospitalization, a score &ge;2 was associated with higher overall and VTE-related mortality. Predictive models such as these need validation before they can be routinely used at the time of admission or during hospitalization to identify those at greatest risk in whom thromboprophylaxis should be administered.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2077320366\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

While thromboprophylaxis reduces the risk of VTE in hospitalized medical patients, mortality benefits are unclear in this population. Importantly, clinicians should be aware that VTE prophylaxis does not eliminate the risk of VTE or VTE-related death. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients at highest risk of VTE include patients who are critically-ill, patients with cancer and stroke, and patients with multiple risk factors for VTE including pregnancy, heart failure, myocardial infarction, old age (&gt;75 years), previous VTE, prolonged immobility, renal failure, obesity, and inherited or acquired hypercoagulable states. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-causes-of-venous-thrombosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the causes of venous thrombosis&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients admitted to hospital with an acute medical illness, a full history and examination should be performed to assess both the risk of VTE and bleeding. However, validated models for evaluating this risk in hospitalized medical patients are lacking. (See <a href=\"#H5138262\" class=\"local\">'Assess risk'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For hospitalized medical patients without obvious risk factors for VTE, we recommend that pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis <strong>not</strong> be employed. Options for this low risk group include early ambulation with or without mechanical methods of thromboprophylaxis. (See <a href=\"#H5137695\" class=\"local\">'Selection of method of prophylaxis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Mechanical methods of thromboprophylaxis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients hospitalized with an acute medical illness, who have at least one risk factor for VTE (moderate to high risk) and do not have an increased risk of bleeding, we recommend the use of pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis rather than mechanical methods or no prophylaxis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Among the available agents, we prefer low molecular weight (LMW) heparin rather than other anticoagulants (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>), particularly in high risk populations (eg, critically-ill, cancer, stroke). For those with renal failure (creatinine clearance &lt;30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min)</span> or for those in whom cost is an issue, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heparin-unfractionated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">unfractionated heparin</a> (UFH) is a reasonable alternative. For patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fondaparinux-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fondaparinux</a> may be used as an alternative to heparin. (See <a href=\"#H5137695\" class=\"local\">'Selection of method of prophylaxis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H79882310\" class=\"local\">'Pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients hospitalized with an acute medical illness with multiple risk factors for VTE, many experts administer more aggressive prophylaxis in the form of increased intensity of a pharmacologic agent (eg, three times a day UFH, twice daily <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enoxaparin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">enoxaparin</a>) or the addition of a mechanical device. (See <a href=\"#H2349553350\" class=\"local\">'Combined methods'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients hospitalized with an acute medical illness who have risk factors for VTE and who are at high risk of bleeding or in whom anticoagulation is contraindicated (eg, gastrointestinal or intracranial hemorrhage), mechanical methods of VTE prevention (eg, intermittent pneumatic compression, graduated compression stockings, venous foot pump) are suggested over no prophylaxis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Among these methods, compression boots are the most common form of mechanical prophylaxis used. Transition to a pharmacologic agent should occur as soon as the bleeding risk becomes acceptably low or has been reversed. (See <a href=\"#H24\" class=\"local\">'Mechanical methods of thromboprophylaxis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H20641730\" class=\"local\">'At risk of bleeding'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Special populations of medical patients require an individualized approach to thromboprophylaxis during an acute hospitalization. These include patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, patients undergoing neuraxial anaesthesia or analgesia, patients with stroke or cancer, patients who are traveling for extended periods, and patients who are pregnant. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuraxial-anesthesia-analgesia-techniques-in-the-patient-receiving-anticoagulant-or-antiplatelet-medication\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuraxial anesthesia/analgesia techniques in the patient receiving anticoagulant or antiplatelet medication&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=medical-complications-of-stroke#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Medical complications of stroke&quot;, section on 'Venous thromboembolism'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=risk-and-prevention-of-venous-thromboembolism-in-adults-with-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Risk and prevention of venous thromboembolism in adults with cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=deep-vein-thrombosis-and-pulmonary-embolism-in-pregnancy-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism in pregnancy: Prevention&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>VTE prophylaxis should typically continue until the patient is ambulatory or discharged from the hospital. We suggest <strong>not </strong>routinely extending the duration of thromboprophylaxis beyond the period of the acute hospital stay (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). However, select populations may benefit from extended duration prophylaxis including non-ambulatory patients admitted to acute rehabilitation for weaning from mechanical ventilation. (See <a href=\"#H5137702\" class=\"local\">'Duration of prophylaxis'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Every hospital should develop a formal active strategy for the prevention of VTE. Strategies should be developed to increase compliance with appropriate use of thromboprophylaxis in at-risk patients, including the use of computerized order sets and prompts, pre-printed orders, and periodic audit, including follow-up with feedback.
