The technique was first described 100 years ago [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffusing-capacity-for-carbon-monoxide/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>] and applied in clinical settings many decades later [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffusing-capacity-for-carbon-monoxide/abstract/4-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-6</a>]. The DLCO measures the ability of the lungs to transfer gas from inhaled air to the red blood cells in pulmonary capillaries. The DLCO test is convenient and easy for the patient to perform. The ten seconds of breathholding required for the DLCO maneuver is easier for most patients to perform than the forced exhalation required for spirometry. </p><p>Standards for DLCO instruments, performance of the test, and calculation of the results were initially published by the American Thoracic Society in 1987, and updated by the American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society in 2005 and in 2017 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffusing-capacity-for-carbon-monoxide/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. The indications for DLCO measurement and the interpretation of the results will be discussed here. The use of other pulmonary function tests in the evaluation of respiratory disease in adults and children is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=office-spirometry\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Office spirometry&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-pulmonary-function-testing-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of pulmonary function testing in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-pulmonary-function-testing-in-children\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of pulmonary function testing in children&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3417032901\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>DLCO &ndash; The diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCO) is also known as the transfer factor for carbon monoxide or TLCO.

It is an index of the efficiency of alveolar transfer of carbon monoxide.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>kCO &ndash; The permeability factor (kCO, minute<sup>-1</sup>) is the rate constant for alveolar-capillary CO transfer (the logarithmic rate of decay of the alveolar CO concentration). </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO) is designed to reflect properties of the alveolar-capillary membrane, specifically the ease with which oxygen moves from inhaled air to the red blood cells in the pulmonary capillaries. The DLCO can be affected by factors that change the membrane properties and also by changes in hemoglobin and capillary blood volume. The process of carbon monoxide (CO) uptake can be simplified into two components: membrane conductance (D<sub>M</sub>) and reactive conductance, the chemical reaction between CO and hemoglobin. D<sub>M</sub> reflects the properties of diffusion across the alveolar capillary interface. Uptake of CO by hemoglobin depends on the reaction rate (R) and the pulmonary capillary blood volume (Vc). The two components occur in series and when conductances occur in series, they are added as reciprocals. This relationship can be expressed as:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p><span class=\"nowrap\">1/DLCO</span> = <span class=\"nowrap\">1/D<sub>M</sub></span> + <span class=\"nowrap\">1/RVc</span></p></div></div><p>Diseases in which the uptake of oxygen is reduced cause parallel decreases in the uptake of CO, as measured by the DLCO. Older textbooks suggest that thickening of the alveolar-capillary membrane (in interstitial lung disease) and loss of alveolar membrane surface area (in emphysema) are the primary causes of a low DLCO. However, subsequent experimental data suggest these and most other diseases that influence the DLCO do so by reducing the volume of red blood cells in the pulmonary capillaries. The total volume of blood in the lungs in healthy adults at rest is less than 150 mL. Diseases in which the alveolar-capillary surface area is reduced (eg, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema) lead to a reduction in the blood volume in the lungs. </p><p>The volume of blood in the pulmonary capillaries and the DLCO are <strong>increased</strong> in the following circumstances:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When pulmonary capillaries are recruited, as occurs during exercise</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When the patient is in the supine position</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>During a Mueller (reverse Valsalva) maneuver</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When a left-to-right cardiac shunt is present</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are multiple clinical indications for measurement of diffusing capacity of the lungs for carbon monoxide (DLCO), and there are no contraindications or adverse effects (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F60997\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef60997 \">table 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffusing-capacity-for-carbon-monoxide/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

While newer equipment with real time gas analyzers may provide a means to measure DLCO in patients with lower vital capacities, results may be less reliable for very low vital capacities.

The major changes in the updated standards address systems using rapidly responding gas analyzers for carbon monoxide and the tracer gas. &#160;</p><p>The criteria for an acceptable DLCO maneuver have also been revised: the inspiratory volume (VI) should be &ge;90 percent of the largest measurement for vital capacity (VC). A maneuver may be deemed acceptable if the VI is &lt;90, but &ge;85 percent of the largest VC and the alveolar volume (VA) is within 200 mL or 5 percent (whichever is greater) of the highest VA among acceptable maneuvers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffusing-capacity-for-carbon-monoxide/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. At least 85 percent of the test gas VI must be inhaled in &lt;4 seconds. The calculated breath-hold time should be 10&plusmn;2 seconds. There should be no evidence of a Mueller or Valsalva maneuver based on observation of the patient during the maneuver and review of the mouth pressure tracing. </p><p>In classic systems, the first 0.75 to 1 L is discarded as dead space gas and then a sample gas volume of 0.5 to 1 L is collected for analysis. In newer systems that use real-time gas analyzers, the standards require measurement of dead space washout; collection of a sample as low as 85 mL can be analyzed immediately after the dead space washout. After a minimum of four minutes, the test is repeated; a longer interval may be needed if the patient has obstructive airways disease. </p><p>To meet the criteria for repeatability, at least two acceptable tests must be within 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min</span> per mmHg (0.67 <span class=\"nowrap\">mmol/min</span> per kPa) of each other [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diffusing-capacity-for-carbon-monoxide/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

An increase of 1 percent in COHb results in a proportionate 1 percent decrease in the measured DLCO.

The increase in KCO is due to an increase in the surface to volume ratio for diffusion per alveolus as the alveoli become smaller because of the relationship of higher surface area to volume at lower lung volumes. The reduction in DLCO is proportionately less than the reduction in VA, so the ratio <span class=\"nowrap\">DLCO/VA</span> is actually increased.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pneumonectomy</strong> &ndash; For patients who have undergone pneumonectomy, but do not have lung disease in the remaining lung, the VA is decreased due to discrete loss of alveolar units.

As a result, the DLCO is slightly decreased. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Emphysema</strong> &ndash; In emphysema, the DLCO is reduced by loss of gas exchanging surface due to alveolar capillary damage and the KCO is low.

The VA is low due to the loss of aerated alveoli.
