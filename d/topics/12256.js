To screen for ovarian cancer, doctors can do a blood test called CA 125, an imaging test called an ultrasound, or both. These tests do not always give useful information about whether a woman has ovarian cancer. Still, doctors sometimes recommend them for women who are at high risk for ovarian cancer. Experts do <strong>not</strong> recommend screening for women who are not at high risk.</p><p>The goal of screening is to find cancer early, before it has a chance to grow, spread, or cause problems. Unfortunately, there is no good proof that screening for ovarian cancer actually helps women live longer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24342070\"><span class=\"h1\">How does ovarian cancer screening work?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Screening can involve a blood test, an ultrasound, or both. The blood test used most often is called CA 125. Other tests are also available or being studied.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>CA 125 blood tests</strong> &ndash; CA 125 is a protein in the blood that goes up when a woman has ovarian cancer. The trouble is, this protein also goes up when a woman has other health problems that do not involve cancer. The test can help find ovarian cancer, but it does not clearly show whether or not the woman has it.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Pelvic ultrasound</strong> &ndash; During a pelvic ultrasound, an ultrasound technician will insert a small device similar to a tampon into your vagina. The device uses sound waves to create images of the inside of your body.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Ultrasounds can find abnormal growths on the ovaries, but they cannot tell whether the growths are caused by cancer. Sometimes growths are caused by less serious health problems or even normal changes that happen during a woman's menstrual cycle.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24342085\"><span class=\"h1\">Who should be screened for ovarian cancer?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It is not clear who should be screened for ovarian cancer. For now, experts agree that:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women who are at low risk for ovarian cancer do <strong>not</strong> need to be screened. This includes women who do not have a family history of ovarian cancer or a cancer gene (described below).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Women who are at high risk for ovarian cancer, and still have their ovaries, should sometimes be screened. This includes women who have a family history of ovarian cancer or a gene that increases their chances of getting ovarian cancer. Women with the highest risk include those who have had genetic tests showing that they:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Carry genes known as the &quot;BRCA&quot; genes</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Have a genetic condition called Lynch syndrome (also called hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer or &quot;HNPCC&quot;)</p><p/><p>If you have a family history of ovarian cancer or have genes that put you at risk of getting ovarian cancer, discuss the pros and cons of screening with your doctor. They can help you decide if screening is right for you.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24342102\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the benefits of being screened for ovarian cancer?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main benefit of screening is that it might help doctors find cancer early, when it should be easier to treat. This might lower your chances of dying of ovarian cancer.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24342119\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the drawbacks to being screened for ovarian cancer?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The main drawback of being screened is that it can lead to &quot;false positives,&quot; meaning that screening shows that a woman might have cancer when she actually does not. This can lead to unneeded worry and to more tests. Sometimes, a false positive test could lead to unneeded surgery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24342136\"><span class=\"h1\">What happens after screening?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After ovarian cancer screening, you should get a phone call or letter with your results. If you do not hear back about your results within 2 weeks, call your doctor or nurse's office. Do not assume that your screening test was normal if you hear nothing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24342153\"><span class=\"h1\">What if my screening test is abnormal?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If your test is abnormal, don't panic. Many women who have abnormal results turn out <strong>not</strong> to have ovarian cancer. You will need more tests to find out whether or not you actually have cancer.</p><p>Most women with abnormal results find out they do not have cancer after further testing. But some women with abnormal results need surgery to know for sure if they have cancer. This surgery is usually done through small incisions (cuts), using a tool called a &quot;laparoscope.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H24342169\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-testing-for-breast-and-ovarian-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Genetic testing for breast and ovarian cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ovarian-cancer-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Ovarian cancer (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-screening-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Cancer screening (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ovarian-cancer-screening-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Ovarian cancer screening (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetic-testing-for-breast-and-ovarian-cancer-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Genetic testing for breast and ovarian cancer (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=ovarian-cancer-diagnosis-and-staging-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Ovarian cancer diagnosis and staging (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=first-line-medical-treatment-of-epithelial-ovarian-cancer-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: First-line medical treatment of epithelial ovarian cancer (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
