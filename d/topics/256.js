They include the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complications-during-hemodialysis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypotension &ndash; 25 to 55 percent of treatments</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cramps &ndash; 5 to 20 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea and vomiting &ndash; 5 to 15 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Headache &ndash; 5 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chest pain &ndash; 2 to 5 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Back pain &ndash; 2 to 5 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Itching &ndash; 5 percent</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fever and chills &ndash; &lt;1 percent</p><p/><p>These complications are generally caused by multiple underlying mechanisms and are poorly understood. Knowledge of their pathogenesis is further complicated by their often simultaneous occurrence. As an example, hypotension with hemodialysis, which has a myriad of possible causes, may be accompanied by nausea, vomiting, headache, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chest pain. Similarly, cramps may be associated with hypotension and are often very difficult to treat. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intradialytic-hypotension-in-an-otherwise-stable-patient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intradialytic hypotension in an otherwise stable patient&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=muscle-cramps-in-dialysis-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Muscle cramps in dialysis patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic will review the causes, diagnosis, and treatment of nausea and vomiting, headache, chest pain, and dyspnea in the nonhypotensive patient undergoing hemodialysis. Hemolysis, air embolism, and a brief overview of arrhythmias will also be presented.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">HEADACHE, NAUSEA, AND VOMITING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Longer treatment times <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ultrafiltration in association with a large degree of solute removal significantly enhance the incidence of headache, nausea, and vomiting during dialysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complications-during-hemodialysis/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. It is important to emphasize that longer treatment times <strong>alone</strong> may not necessarily be associated with adverse effects. The lack of such effects with extended hemodialysis treatment times in the dialysis center in Tassin, France as well as with nocturnal hemodialysis indicate that length of treatment alone may be unimportant if the solute clearance rate is slow. In addition, dialyzer membrane composition (cellulosic versus noncellulosic), surface area, and biocompatibility are <strong>not</strong> significant factors underlying these intradialytic symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complications-during-hemodialysis/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>].</p><p>Since longer treatment times combined with high urea removal rates appear to be important, a variant of the dialysis disequilibrium syndrome may underlie these symptoms in many patients. Dialysis disequilibrium is thought to be due to water movement into the brain as a result of a reverse osmotic shift induced by urea removal (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dialysis-disequilibrium-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dialysis disequilibrium syndrome&quot;</a>). Although quite uncommon, the syndrome should be considered in the noncompliant <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> inadequately dialyzed patient who develops nausea, vomiting, or headache while being aggressively dialyzed. In this setting, initially altering the dialysis prescription in favor of less intensive and more frequent treatments may avoid these complications.</p><p>Patients who have headaches on dialysis in the absence of hypotension and suspected dialysis disequilibrium should be questioned about caffeine use, which can sometimes precipitate headache [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complications-during-hemodialysis/abstract/1,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6</a>]. In addition, metabolic disturbances (eg, hypoglycemia, hypernatremia, and hyponatremia), uremia, subdural hematoma, and medication-induced headaches should be considered in patients with recurrent dialysis-associated headaches [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complications-during-hemodialysis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dialysis-disequilibrium-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dialysis disequilibrium syndrome&quot;</a>). Rarely, dialysis-associated headache may be associated with increased intraocular pressure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complications-during-hemodialysis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>In some patients, psychological factors may contribute to dialysis-associated somatic complaints. Using multiple logistic regression, one group found that a poor affect score on indices of affect and quality-of-life scales was the strongest correlate for predicting somatic symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complications-during-hemodialysis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CHEST PAIN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As previously discussed, chest pain that occurs while a patient is being dialyzed may be associated with hypotension or dialysis disequilibrium syndrome. Additional possibilities should always be considered; these include angina, hemolysis, and (rarely) air embolism. Furthermore, although pulmonary embolism is extremely uncommon in dialysis patients, this complication may be observed after manipulation of thrombus <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> occlusion of the dialysis access [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complications-during-hemodialysis/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Acutely, the decision to continue or stop the dialysis treatment because of chest pain is based upon clinical findings, such as hemodynamic stability, and the results of the history and physical examination.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Angina</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Angina should always be considered as the underlying cause of chest discomfort in the patient undergoing dialysis, given the increased incidence of coronary disease in this setting (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of coronary heart disease in end-stage renal disease (dialysis)&quot;</a>). The appropriate history, physical examination, and, if clinically indicated, electrocardiogram and cardiac enzyme evaluation should therefore be performed (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=angina-pectoris-chest-pain-caused-by-myocardial-ischemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Angina pectoris: Chest pain caused by myocardial ischemia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=serum-cardiac-biomarkers-in-patients-with-renal-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Serum cardiac biomarkers in patients with renal failure&quot;</a>). If dialysis is continued, the administration of oxygen and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, reduction of the desired ultrafiltration <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> blood pump speed, and administration of nitrates or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=morphine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">morphine</a> should be considered on an individual basis.</p><p>Angina during dialysis may be prevented with the administration of nitrates <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> beta blockers prior to the treatment. However, the efficacy of these agents is diminished since they commonly result in hypotension, thereby reducing the ability to effectively remove extracellular fluid. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stable-ischemic-heart-disease-overview-of-care\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stable ischemic heart disease: Overview of care&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Hemolysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hemolysis may present as chest pain, chest tightness, or back pain. It deserves consideration as an etiologic factor in the patient with these complaints, particularly if multiple individuals have such symptoms simultaneously. If hemolysis is not recognized early, severe hyperkalemia may ensue and lead to death.</p><p>Findings highly suggestive of substantial hemolysis include [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complications-during-hemodialysis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A port-wine appearance of the blood in the venous line</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complaints of chest pain, shortness of breath, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> back pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A falling hematocrit</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A pink color of the plasma in centrifuged specimens</p><p/><p>The etiology of hemolysis in hemodialysis patients is usually related to problems with the dialysis solution [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complications-during-hemodialysis/abstract/1,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,12</a>]. These include (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=contaminants-in-water-used-for-hemodialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Contaminants in water used for hemodialysis&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Overheating</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypotonicity due to an insufficient concentrate-to-water ratio</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contamination with formaldehyde, bleach, chloramine, or nitrates from the water supply and copper from copper tubing or piping</p><p/><p>Red blood cell trauma due to improperly functioning roller clamps on dialysis machines, kinking of the blood lines, and poorly constructed blood tubing can also occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complications-during-hemodialysis/abstract/1,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,13,14</a>]. Hemolysis may also be caused by bypassing arterial pillows, which are still utilized to monitor for excessive pressure in some dialysis units [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complications-during-hemodialysis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>The initial treatment of suspected hemolysis in a patient on hemodialysis is to stop dialysis immediately, clamp the blood lines (do not return the blood to avoid increasing the risk of hyperkalemia), prepare to treat hyperkalemia and the potentially severe anemia, and investigate the cause. Patients require hospitalization for observation since life-threatening hyperkalemia may develop after dialysis has been terminated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of hyperkalemia in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-hyperkalemia-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of hyperkalemia in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Air embolism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Air embolism during dialysis is another cause of chest pain as well as other symptoms, particularly dyspnea. It can lead to death unless quickly detected and treated (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=air-embolism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Air embolism&quot;</a>). Fortunately, air embolism is rare in hemodialysis patients, in part because of the presence of air detectors in hemodialysis machines (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-hemodialysis-apparatus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the hemodialysis apparatus&quot;</a>). Foam in the venous blood line should make one suspect that air is entering the dialysis system. Disconnection of connecting caps <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> blood lines can also lead to air embolism in patients being dialyzed with central venous catheters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complications-during-hemodialysis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Symptoms due to an air embolism depend in part upon the patient's physical position at the time of the event. In the seated patient, air tends to migrate into the cerebral venous system without entering the heart; in those who are recumbent, air tends to first enter the heart and then the lungs. As a result, the seated patient with an air embolism may lose consciousness and seize, while the recumbent patient may initially develop dyspnea, cough, and, perhaps, chest tightness. Subsequent acute neurologic and cardiac dysfunction in the recumbent patient may be due to the direct passage of air into the arterial system, paradoxical embolization, or incomplete filtering of a large air embolus by the pulmonary capillaries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complications-during-hemodialysis/abstract/1,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=seizures-in-patients-undergoing-hemodialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Seizures in patients undergoing hemodialysis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=air-embolism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Air embolism&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Treatment of suspected air embolism includes clamping the venous line and stopping the blood pump. The patient should be positioned on the <strong>left side</strong>, in a supine position, with the chest and head tilted downward. Cardiorespiratory support, the administration of 100 percent oxygen by either mask or endotracheal tube, and attempted percutaneous aspiration of air from the ventricle may be required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complications-during-hemodialysis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The most important aspect of air embolism is prevention; this is accomplished through the adequate function of monitoring devices on dialysis machines. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=air-embolism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Air embolism&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">ARRHYTHMIAS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The occurrence of ventricular arrhythmias in dialysis patients has been evaluated by Holter monitoring. These arrhythmias are common during dialysis and between treatments; the published frequency ranges widely, from 5 to 75 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complications-during-hemodialysis/abstract/17-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-22</a>]. Supraventricular arrhythmias are also common [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complications-during-hemodialysis/abstract/17,21,23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,21,23,24</a>].</p><p>Risk factors for arrhythmias and sudden death in dialysis patients include coronary artery disease, advanced age, myocardial dysfunction, and left ventricular hypertrophy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complications-during-hemodialysis/abstract/17-21,23,25-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-21,23,25-30</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=myocardial-dysfunction-in-end-stage-renal-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Myocardial dysfunction in end-stage renal disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-coronary-heart-disease-in-end-stage-renal-disease-dialysis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of coronary heart disease in end-stage renal disease (dialysis)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-of-sudden-cardiac-arrest-and-sudden-cardiac-death-in-dialysis-patients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation of sudden cardiac arrest and sudden cardiac death in dialysis patients&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with underlying autonomic dysfunction are also at greater risk of arrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complications-during-hemodialysis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intradialytic-hypotension-in-an-otherwise-stable-patient#H715661304\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intradialytic hypotension in an otherwise stable patient&quot;, section on 'Autonomic dysfunction'</a>). A higher prevalence of conduction defects, particularly first-degree atrioventricular block and bundle branch block, has been associated with mitral valve or mitral annular calcification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complications-during-hemodialysis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p>During hemodialysis, the incidence of arrhythmias may be enhanced because of rapid fluctuations in hemodynamics and electrolyte concentrations, as well as the induction of hypoxemia in patients with a high incidence of myocardial disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complications-during-hemodialysis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Studies examining the role of potassium in dialysis-induced arrhythmias are somewhat contradictory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complications-during-hemodialysis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>], but new techniques may lead to a better understanding of the interactions of potassium, hemodialysis, and arrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complications-during-hemodialysis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. Some reports have found no relationship of plasma potassium to the development of arrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complications-during-hemodialysis/abstract/17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-19</a>], and the use of low-potassium dialysate has been reported to be safe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complications-during-hemodialysis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>].</p><p>However, other studies have found a correlation between changes in the plasma potassium concentration during dialysis and the incidence of arrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complications-during-hemodialysis/abstract/29,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,36</a>]. One prospective, multicenter, randomized study of 42 patients, for example, examined the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias with two different dialysate potassium concentration protocols [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complications-during-hemodialysis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. One arm of the study was designed to maintain a constant plasma-to-dialysate potassium concentration gradient throughout the dialysis procedure, while the other protocol consisted of the standard constant dialysate potassium concentration, which results in a varying potassium gradient. Treatment with the constant plasma-to-dialysate potassium gradient protocol resulted in 36 and 32 percent reductions in premature ventricular contractions per hour and ventricular couplets per hour during hemodialysis, respectively, compared with dialysis using a constant dialysate potassium concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complications-during-hemodialysis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. Better study of the relationship of dialysate potassium to dialysis-associated arrhythmias is needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complications-during-hemodialysis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>].</p><p>Additional study is needed to clarify the causes of arrhythmias during dialysis. Atrial fibrillation seems to occur more commonly during the dialysis procedure and is overall more common on dialysis days as demonstrated in a study of 40 hemodialysis patients with implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complications-during-hemodialysis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Since atrial fibrillation is among the most common arrhythmias, additional investigation into the relationship of atrial fibrillation with the hemodialysis treatment itself is needed.</p><p>A study of 77 hemodialysis patients who underwent Holter monitoring over six consecutive dialysis sessions found that supraventricular arrhythmias occurred in 38 patients (49.3 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complications-during-hemodialysis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. All episodes were short and self-limited, and the arrhythmias were associated with patient age and right atrial enlargement. During the 40-month follow-up period, 57 patients died, 52.6 percent due to cardiovascular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complications-during-hemodialysis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Supraventricular arrhythmias were associated with all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 3.21, 95% CI 1.29-7.96). The patients with supraventricular arrhythmias had a higher risk of nonfatal cardiovascular events and symptomatic atrial fibrillation (HR 4.32 and 17.19, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complications-during-hemodialysis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Additional study of the association of arrhythmias during hemodialysis seems warranted.</p><p>The treatment of arrhythmias that occur in dialysis patients, either during or between dialysis sessions, is similar to their treatment in the nondialysis patient (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=arrhythmia-management-for-the-primary-care-clinician\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Arrhythmia management for the primary care clinician&quot;</a>). However, appropriate dosing of medications based upon the absence of renal function is always required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complications-during-hemodialysis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13274142\"><span class=\"h1\">DYSPNEA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients may complain of shortness of breath while on hemodialysis. Most often, the dyspnea will occur as a result of volume overload, and the patient will describe the dyspnea as occurring before the start of the hemodialysis treatment.</p><p>However, dyspnea that begins after the initiation of hemodialysis should prompt consideration of other possible causes, such as angina or acute coronary syndrome, bacteremia (associated with dialysis catheter), a reaction to the dialyzer, pericardial effusion with or without tamponade, or pneumonia.</p><p>Medications administered with hemodialysis may be associated with dyspnea and should be considered, particularly intravenous (IV) iron, which may rarely cause an allergic reaction, and heparin, which can be associated with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia, resulting in clotting in the dialyzer and lines and resultant hypoxia and a capillary leak syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complications-during-hemodialysis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>The presence of simultaneous symptoms (eg, fever, chills, hypotension, cough) often leads to the identification of the cause of the dyspnea. The timing of onset of dyspnea may also provide clues to its etiology. As an example, pulmonary embolism should be considered if dyspnea occurs after access declotting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-complications-during-hemodialysis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p>Recurrent episodes of dyspnea occurring on dialysis are most likely to be associated with dialyzer reactions or possibly heparin-associated effects.
