In a Spanish study of 2132 consecutive unselected patients with venous thromboembolism, for example, 12.9 percent had an anticoagulant protein deficiency (7.3 percent with protein S, 3.2 percent with protein C, and 0.5 percent with antithrombin).

The prevalence of a protein deficiency was only modestly greater in &quot;high risk&quot; patients with recurrent, familial, or juvenile onset deep vein thrombosis (9, 16, and 12 percent respectively).

The lifetime probability of developing thrombosis compared with those with no defect was 8.5 times higher for carriers of protein S deficiency, 8.1 for antithrombin deficiency, 7.3 for protein C deficiency, and 2.2 for factor V Leiden.

Carriers of two (or more) defects seem to be at a higher risk for thrombosis than their relatives with a single defect. In one review of four studies, approximately 75 percent of the family members who were carriers of two defects had experienced thrombosis compared with 10 to 30 percent of the carriers of a single defect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-venous-thrombosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Inherited thrombophilia also may interact to increase the risk of venous thrombosis in patients with acquired causes of hypercoagulability, such as oral contraceptive use (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F56252\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56252 \">table 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-venous-thrombosis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>] and pregnancy (see <a href=\"#H23407368\" class=\"local\">'Combined acquired plus inherited risk factors'</a> below).</p><p>The clinical characteristics and diagnosis of the five major causes of inherited thrombophilia: the factor V Leiden mutation, antithrombin deficiency, protein S and protein C deficiency, and the prothrombin gene mutation, are discussed in detail separately.

As will be seen, it remains unclear whether some of these disorders are actually associated with an increased risk of venous thrombosis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Heparin cofactor II deficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Heparin cofactor II (antithrombin is heparin cofactor I) is a heparin-dependent glycoprotein that acts as a thrombin inhibitor. Several families have been described with quantitative deficiency in this protein inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Heterozygous individuals have plasma heparin cofactor II concentrations that are approximately 50 percent of normal values.</p><p>It is not clear if heparin cofactor II deficiency is a significant risk factor for thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-venous-thrombosis/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>]. In one series of 305 patients with juvenile thromboembolic episodes, two patients had heparin cofactor II deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-venous-thrombosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. However, each of these patients had a second defect: the factor V Leiden mutation and protein C deficiency.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Plasminogen deficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Congenital plasminogen deficiency is usually inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. There are both quantitative defects (type I, hypoplasminogenemia in the heterozygote and aplasminogenemia in the homozygote) and functional defects (type 2, dysplasminogenemia). Venous thrombosis has been reported in some patients identified with plasminogen deficiency, but a familial predisposition is usually absent. </p><p>The clinical importance of plasminogen deficiency as a risk factor for thrombosis is uncertain. In a Spanish study of 2132 consecutive patients with thrombosis, plasminogen deficiency was seen in 0.75 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-venous-thrombosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, this prevalence may not be significantly higher than that seen in the general population. In a cohort of 9611 blood donors, for example, 0.29 percent had asymptomatic familial plasminogen deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-venous-thrombosis/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Additional clinical findings associated with plasminogen deficiency (eg, ligneous conjunctivitis) are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thrombotic-and-hemorrhagic-disorders-due-to-abnormal-fibrinolysis#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thrombotic and hemorrhagic disorders due to abnormal fibrinolysis&quot;, section on 'Plasminogen deficiency'</a>.)</p><p>Other rare fibrinolytic defects such as impaired tissue plasminogen activator release or increased plasminogen activator inhibitor levels have been linked to thrombosis in isolated families [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-venous-thrombosis/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>], and may increase the risk of venous thrombosis in subjects with other thrombophilic defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-venous-thrombosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. In one of these kindreds, six of the seven subjects with a history of thrombosis were also deficient in total and free protein S [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-venous-thrombosis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Once again, the pathogenetic importance of these defects is uncertain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thrombotic-and-hemorrhagic-disorders-due-to-abnormal-fibrinolysis#H19\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thrombotic and hemorrhagic disorders due to abnormal fibrinolysis&quot;, section on 'Plasminogen activator inhibitor'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Dysfibrinogenemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with dysfibrinogenemia have structural defects that cause alterations in the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin. Approximately 300 abnormal fibrinogens have been reported, and more than 80 structural defects have been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-venous-thrombosis/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. The most common structural defects involve the fibrinopeptides and their cleavage sites, and the second most common involves the gamma-chain polymerization region. Approximately one-half of the mutants are clinically silent, whereas hemorrhage and thrombosis occur in almost equal numbers of symptomatic patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=disorders-of-fibrinogen\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Disorders of fibrinogen&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Factor XII deficiency</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Factor XII, Hageman factor, is the zymogen of a serine protease that initiates the contact activation reactions and intrinsic blood coagulation in vitro. Severe factor XII deficiency (factor XII activity less than 1 percent of normal) is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait; affected patients have marked prolongation in the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) but do not exhibit a bleeding diathesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-venous-thrombosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. To the contrary, venous thromboembolism and myocardial infarction have been reported in a number of factor XII-deficient patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-venous-thrombosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>], including John Hageman, the initial patient described with this abnormality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-venous-thrombosis/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. This thrombophilic tendency has been attributed to reduced plasma fibrinolytic activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-venous-thrombosis/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].</p><p>The frequency with which severe factor XII deficiency leads to thrombosis is uncertain. One review found that 8 percent had a history of thromboembolism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-venous-thrombosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. However, interpretation of this type of data is difficult, since patients with complications are more likely to be reported than those who are asymptomatic.</p><p>This concern has led some groups to perform cross-sectional analyses of thromboembolic events in larger numbers of unselected families with factor XII deficiency. In a study of 14 Swiss families with factor XII deficiency, 2 of 18 homozygous or doubly heterozygous patients had sustained deep venous thrombosis; however, each episode occurred at a time when other predisposing thrombotic risk factors were present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-venous-thrombosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Only one of 45 heterozygotes in these families had a possible history of venous thrombosis. However, other groups have found a more pronounced association with thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-the-causes-of-venous-thrombosis/abstract/43,44\" class=\"abstract_t\">43,44</a>].
