In addition, special equipment, such as large blood pressure cuffs and an ultrasound machine, should be available in the operating room and the ICU. If too small a cuff is used, the pressure generated by inflating the cuff may not be fully transmitted to the brachial artery; in this setting, the pressure in the cuff may be considerably higher than the intra-arterial pressure, which can lead to overestimation of the systolic pressure by 10 to as much as 50 mmHg in obese patients.

The usual anatomic landmarks are obscured, the distance from skin to vessel is much further than normal, and the angle of approach may be too steep to allow cannulation even after reaching the vessel. Ultrasound can help identify vascular structures and assist in the placement of venous and arterial catheters [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-surgery-intensive-care-unit-management-of-the-complicated-postoperative-patient/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p>The utility of cardiac monitoring devices and the technical details of insertion are reviewed as separate topics.

OSA and OHS can complicate management of severely obese patients because of an abnormally small upper airway and chronic hypercarbic respiratory failure, respectively. OSA is extremely common in very obese patients; in one series, over 70 percent of patients who underwent polysomnography prior to bariatric surgery had OSA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/bariatric-surgery-intensive-care-unit-management-of-the-complicated-postoperative-patient/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

This also applies to the obese patient undergoing any other elective operation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-the-obese-patient#H1762560065\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for the obese patient&quot;, section on 'Extubation'</a>.)</p><p>If the postoperative obese patient demonstrates either respiratory or hemodynamic instability in the immediate postoperative period in the postanesthesia care unit, the patient should remain intubated and be immediately transferred to the intensive care unit.

This is generally due to a heavy, noncompliant chest wall, rather than pulmonary parenchymal restriction.
