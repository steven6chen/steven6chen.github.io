They are found in the blood and in the bone marrow (the tissue in the center of certain bones).</p><p>A stem cell transplant is when healthy stem cells are put into a person's body to replace stem cells that are diseased or damaged. This is also called a &quot;hematopoietic stem cell transplant&quot; or &quot;bone marrow transplant.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15049610\"><span class=\"h1\">Why might someone need a stem cell transplant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A person might have a stem cell transplant to help treat a cancer, such as leukemia or lymphoma, or another medical condition. The healthy stem cells can come from a few different sources:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The person's own body</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A relative, such as a brother or sister</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A person who is not related</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blood from a newborn baby's umbilical cord</p><p/><p>A person who gives stem cells to another person is called a &quot;donor.&quot;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15049616\"><span class=\"h1\">What does it mean to be a &quot;match&quot;?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To donate stem cells to another person, your blood needs to closely match theirs. To check this, doctors can do special tests to look at certain proteins on your body's cells. This is called &quot;HLA typing.&quot;. HLA type is <strong>not</strong> the same as blood type (A, B, AB, or O).</p><p>When a person needs a stem cell transplant, siblings (brothers and sisters) might be tested to find out if any of them is a &quot;match.&quot; There is about a 1 in 4 chance that a brother or sister will be a match for HLA type. If there is a match, a sibling donor is usually the best option. That's because siblings share similar genes, so the stem cells are more likely to work well with the body of the person who gets them.</p><p>If no sibling is a good match, doctors can try to find a donor who is not related to the person. This is often done by searching registries. Registries are lists of people all over the world who have volunteered to donate stem cells. The chances of finding a match from a registry partly depend on the person's race and background.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15049622\"><span class=\"h1\">Are there other requirements for donating stem cells?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you are found to be a &quot;match&quot; for someone who needs stem cells, that's the first step. But there are other requirements, too.</p><p>To donate stem cells, you must be in generally good health. You will have a physical exam and blood tests before you are allowed to donate. You will also need to answer questions about your health and behavior. These usually include questions about:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The medicines you take, or took in the past</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Any recent vaccines that you have gotten</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Whether you have had certain diseases</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Countries you have lived in or traveled to</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sex partners you have had</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drug use</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Past pregnancies</p><p/><p>You will get information about the donation procedure and risks. You will also be asked to sign forms saying that you agree to be a donor. It's important that you are making the choice to be a donor for yourself, and no one is pressuring you to do it.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15049628\"><span class=\"h1\">What is the procedure like?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>It depends on how your stem cells are collected. They can be taken from either the bone marrow or the blood. Your doctor will talk to you about each option, and help you decide which is best for your situation.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Blood collection</strong> &ndash; If you are going to donate stem cells from your blood, a needle will be inserted into a vein in each of your arms. Your blood will be taken from one arm and run through a special machine that collects the stem cells. After the stem cells are taken out, the rest of the blood goes back into your body through the other arm. This usually takes a few hours. Most donors only need to do this once for enough stem cells to be collected, but some people need to go back a second time.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">You will need to take a medicine to help your blood produce extra stem cells for several days before the collection. This medicine comes in a shot that may be given at the doctor's office, or you might give yourself the shot at home each day. It causes temporary muscle or bone pain in most people. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">Acetaminophen</a> (brand name: Tylenol) can help with this.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Bone marrow collection</strong> &ndash; If you are going to donate bone marrow, right before the procedure you will be given medicine (called anesthesia). The medicine prevents you from feeling pain. A doctor will insert a special needle into the back of your hip bone, and take out some of your bone marrow. The doctor will need to insert the needle more than once to get enough bone marrow. After the procedure, the area will be covered with a bandage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If you are a bone marrow donor, you will need to avoid alcohol for about 2 weeks before the procedure. You will also be asked to avoid medicines known as &quot;nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs,&quot; or NSAIDs, for 24 hours before. These medicines include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">ibuprofen</a> (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">naproxen</a> (sample brand name: Aleve). Some people need to take iron pills before and after donating bone marrow.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15049634\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the risks to me?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both ways of donating stem cells involve some pain. For bone marrow donation, you are more likely to have pain after the procedure, in the hip area where the needles went in. There are also risks that go along with any surgery, including infection or problems with anesthesia. For blood stem cell donation, you are more likely to have pain in the days before the procedure. This is related to the medicine you take to help your body make more stem cells.</p><p>Most people who donate stem cells feel good about being able to help someone. You might have some stress, especially if you are donating to a family member. Keep in mind that by donating stem cells, you are improving someone's chances at a healthy life. A stem cell transplant does not always lead to recovery, and it's not your fault if the person does not get better.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15049640\"><span class=\"h1\">What will my recovery be like?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you donated bone marrow, you will likely have some pain after the procedure. You might also be more tired than usual. But you should feel back to normal in a month or so. You should avoid heavy lifting and intense exercise for about 6 weeks, to allow your body to heal.</p><p>If you donated blood stem cells, you might feel fine right after the procedure. Your doctor might tell you to rest for a few days, but you should be able to get back to normal activities soon. No matter which way your stem cells were collected, your body will create more to replace the ones that were removed. You will be back to having the normal amount of stem cells within a few weeks or months.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15049688\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=bone-marrow-transplant-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Bone marrow transplant (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hematopoietic-cell-transplantation-bone-marrow-transplantation-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Hematopoietic cell transplantation (bone marrow transplantation) (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
