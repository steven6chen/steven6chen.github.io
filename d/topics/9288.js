Both short and long interpregnancy intervals have been associated with adverse outcome, but the bulk of adverse effects have been associated with short intervals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpregnancy-interval-and-obstetrical-complications/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. Whether the interpregnancy interval is a significant independent biological risk factor for adverse pregnancy events is important because women have some control over the spacing of their pregnancies and thus could potentially reduce their risk of adverse outcomes. Avoidance of short intervals can be achieved through postpartum provision of contraception, but avoidance of long interpregnancy intervals is more problematic since a desired pregnancy may be precluded by subfertility, availability of a partner, economic issues, or illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpregnancy-interval-and-obstetrical-complications/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>Determining whether any particular factor has a clinically significant influence on pregnancy is complex. Many variables are known to influence pregnancy outcome and a single factor, such as interpregnancy interval, cannot be studied without accounting for myriad potential confounders. There are many reasons for the associations described in this topic, and causality should not be assumed. Some examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the interval between births is measured and the second birth is preterm, the interbirth interval will be shorter than for a term birth and associated with higher neonatal mortality due to prematurity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpregnancy-interval-and-obstetrical-complications/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After a stillbirth or neonatal death, women often wish to conceive again with minimal delay. If the causative factors for the fetal or neonatal death recur, an association between short interpregnancy interval and perinatal mortality would be observed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Breastfeeding both improves infant survival and lengthens the interval between pregnancies due to lactational amenorrhea, thus confounding the relationship between longer interpregnancy interval and improved pregnancy outcome. However, breastfeeding may also deplete the mother, thereby worsening pregnancy outcome.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Socioeconomic factors and maternal health issues may affect both timing of pregnancy and outcome of pregnancy. In some cases, closer birth spacing is the unintended result of lack of correct and consistent use of contraception, and in others, it is an intentional response to later initiation of childbearing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpregnancy-interval-and-obstetrical-complications/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The type of pregnancy event needs to be considered.

The calculation of the BTB interval can be the same for two women even though one woman conceives only twice during the interval and the other conceives multiple times since BTB ignores abortions and fetal deaths. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Inter-outcome interval</strong> &ndash; Inter-outcome interval (IOI) is defined as the interval between one pregnancy outcome and the next, regardless of pregnancy outcome. Because all pregnancies are evaluated, IOI provides better risk assessment for stillbirth or a spontaneous or induced abortion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpregnancy-interval-and-obstetrical-complications/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1915243\"><span class=\"h1\">DEFINITION OF SHORT AND LONG IPI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The definitions for short and long interpregnancy interval (IPI) have not been standardized. A short IPI has been defined as less than 3, 6, 9, 12, or 18 months. An IPI less than 6 months is most often associated with adverse outcomes, but some studies have reported correlations with adverse outcome for IPI less than 3 months or IPI less than 18 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpregnancy-interval-and-obstetrical-complications/abstract/3,8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8-11</a>]. </p><p>A long IPI is usually defined as an IPI more than 60 months.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H509397565\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE AND DEMOGRAPHICS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>According to a 2015 report by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that included birth certificate data from 36 states, about 30 percent of American women had a short IPI defined as less than 18 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpregnancy-interval-and-obstetrical-complications/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Approximately 50 percent had an IPI of 18 to 59 months and 20 percent had an IPI &ge;60 months.</p><p>Short IPI was associated with young maternal age: More than two-thirds of teenagers aged 15 to 19 had short IPI; the next-highest percentage was among women aged 20 to 29 (35 percent). </p><p>Long IPI was most common for older women. Among women aged 30 to 44, 30 percent had a long IPI. Women with less than a bachelor's degree were about twice as likely to have a long IPI compared with women with a bachelor's degree or higher (23 versus 13 percent). Non-US born Hispanic women had the highest percentage of long IPI of all race and ethnicity groups (30 percent), followed by non-Hispanic black women (24 percent), US-born Hispanic women (22 percent), and non-Hispanic white women (16 percent). Unmarried women had a higher percentage of long IPI compared with married women (24 versus 19 percent). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1915250\"><span class=\"h1\">HYPOTHESES FOR THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN IPI AND ADVERSE PREGNANCY OUTCOME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain the relationship between interpregnancy interval (IPI) and adverse pregnancy outcome, but none have been proven.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28528535\"><span class=\"h2\">Short IPI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>According to the maternal depletion hypothesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpregnancy-interval-and-obstetrical-complications/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>], maternal nutrients (particularly folate) may not be replenished sufficiently between closely-spaced pregnancies, particularly among breastfeeding mothers, and this may lead to adverse pregnancy outcomes. While maternal depletion may be more prevalent and severe in low income countries due to malnutrition, the maternal depletion hypothesis may also apply to mothers in high income countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpregnancy-interval-and-obstetrical-complications/abstract/8,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,16,17</a>]. Ten studies from developed countries have reported low serum levels of folate during the postpartum period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpregnancy-interval-and-obstetrical-complications/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>]. In addition, a large prospective cohort study from the Netherlands reported a negative association between short IPI and fetal growth, and that women not using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=folic-acid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">folic acid</a> supplements were at a greater risk of fetal growth restriction after a short IPI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpregnancy-interval-and-obstetrical-complications/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Infectious processes extending from the previous birth to the index pregnancy have also been hypothesized to contribute to the link between short IPI and adverse pregnancy outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpregnancy-interval-and-obstetrical-complications/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>]. In particular, inflammation of the genital tract that developed in the previous pregnancy and did not completely resolve may be a link between short IPI and preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM) and subsequent preterm birth (PTB) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpregnancy-interval-and-obstetrical-complications/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Other factors that have been suggested to account for an association between short IPI and poor obstetrical and neonatal outcomes include cervical insufficiency, sibling competition for maternal resources, transmission of infection between closely spaced siblings, and incomplete healing of the uterine scar from previous cesarean delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpregnancy-interval-and-obstetrical-complications/abstract/18,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1915273\"><span class=\"h2\">Long IPI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The physiological regression hypothesis has been proposed to explain the association between long IPI and adverse pregnancy outcome. It asserts that pregnancy causes physiological adaptations of the reproductive system, such as an increase in blood flow to the uterus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpregnancy-interval-and-obstetrical-complications/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. When IPI is prolonged beyond a certain point, the subsequent pregnancy can no longer benefit from these temporary beneficial adaptations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1915289\"><span class=\"h1\">PREGNANCY AND NEWBORN COMPLICATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH IPI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Both short and long interpregnancy intervals (IPI) have been associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes. Meta-analyses, synthesizing data from multiple independent studies, assist in characterizing the effect of IPI on adverse perinatal outcomes. Individual studies differ in their statistical strength and in their ability to account for the effects of confounding factors such as co-morbidities, socioeconomic status, or lifestyle differences. </p><p>Several investigators have argued that the apparent association between short IPI and obstetrical complications may simply reflect the prevalence of short IPIs among women predisposed to adverse outcomes based on confounding factors (eg, maternal age, socioeconomic status, lifestyle, and the outcome of the previous pregnancy). In support of this hypothesis, some groups have observed that short IPI was associated with increased risk for adverse outcomes such as PTB in the traditional &quot;between mother analysis,&quot; but the risk was substantially attenuated in the &quot;within mother analysis,&quot; suggesting that short IPI is a marker for unmeasured confounding factors rather than for a biologic phenomenon underlying the etiology of PTB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpregnancy-interval-and-obstetrical-complications/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>]. In contrast, a group using both unconditional and conditional logistic regression models found that short IPI (&lt;6 months) was associated with increased risk for PTB, which suggests that factors besides maternal characteristics may account for the association between short IPI and obstetrical complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpregnancy-interval-and-obstetrical-complications/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27187949\"><span class=\"h2\">Maternal anemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The maternal depletion hypothesis predicts a higher rate of maternal anemia after a short IPI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpregnancy-interval-and-obstetrical-complications/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. A large study including data from 18 Latin American countries reported a 30 percent increase in risk of maternal anemia after IPI less than 6 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpregnancy-interval-and-obstetrical-complications/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>], while previous and smaller studies were unable to detect a significant association [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpregnancy-interval-and-obstetrical-complications/abstract/33-35\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-35</a>]. </p><p>Whether lack of maternal repletion after a short IPI results in maternal anemia is unclear, as short IPI has also been associated with other possible causes of maternal anemia, such as third trimester bleeding from placental abruption or placenta previa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpregnancy-interval-and-obstetrical-complications/abstract/32,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,36</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1915314\"><span class=\"h2\">Preterm premature rupture of membranes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>About 25 percent of all preterm births are attributed to premature rupture of membranes (PPROM).

In a 2006 meta-analysis, an IPI less than 6 months was associated with a 40 percent increase in risk for PTB [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpregnancy-interval-and-obstetrical-complications/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Subsequently published studies have confirmed these findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpregnancy-interval-and-obstetrical-complications/abstract/39-43\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-43</a>]. In one, IPIs less than 6 months and 6 to 12 months were associated with an increased risk for PTB (adjusted OR 1.4) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpregnancy-interval-and-obstetrical-complications/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

When only spontaneous PTBs were considered, women with IPI &le;6 months were at 3.6-fold increased risk for early spontaneous PTB (less than 34 weeks) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpregnancy-interval-and-obstetrical-complications/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].

This study adjusted for multiple factors, including gestational weight gain, smoking, age, race, parity, and infant birth weight.

Interestingly, an increased risk of autism was also found for IPIs 12 to 23 months and 24 to 35 months, with odds ratios of 1.86 and 1.26, respectively. In other studies, maternal folate supplementation was associated with a reduced risk of autism among offspring, which supports the hypothesis that maternal depletion plays a role in the association between autism and short IPI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpregnancy-interval-and-obstetrical-complications/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>].</p><p>Folate deficiency during famine is believed to partially explain the association between prenatal exposure to famine and schizophrenia in offspring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpregnancy-interval-and-obstetrical-complications/abstract/63-65\" class=\"abstract_t\">63-65</a>]. A study of the hypothesis that the risk of schizophrenia may be elevated in children conceived following a short IPI when maternal folate stores are still being replenished found that IPIs less than 6 months or 7 to 12 months were associated with an increased risk for developing schizophrenia, with hazard ratios of 2.62 and 1.78, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpregnancy-interval-and-obstetrical-complications/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1915466\"><span class=\"h2\">Fetal, neonatal, or infant death</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An association between short IPI and fetal, neonatal, or infant death has been suggested by several studies; however, the reports have not reported consistent findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpregnancy-interval-and-obstetrical-complications/abstract/3,14,26,37,41,50,67-69\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,14,26,37,41,50,67-69</a>].

However, in a subsequent cross-sectional study of 456,889 parous women in Latin America, maternal death was 2.54 times more likely after an IPI less than 6 months versus 18 to 23 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpregnancy-interval-and-obstetrical-complications/abstract/2,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,32</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1915422\"><span class=\"h1\">PREGNANCY COMPLICATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH IOI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In contrast to interpregnancy interval (IPI), which assesses the time between a live birth and the next pregnancy, the inter-outcome interval (IOI) is defined as the interval between any pregnancy outcome and the next pregnancy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27188081\"><span class=\"h2\">Miscarriage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In 2005, the World Health Organization (WHO) evaluated birth spacing following different pregnancy outcomes; data on birth spacing after an abortion were scarce. Based on a single large-scale study conducted in Latin America (n = 258,108) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpregnancy-interval-and-obstetrical-complications/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>], the WHO recommended that couples wait at least six months after an induced or spontaneous abortion before attempting another pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpregnancy-interval-and-obstetrical-complications/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Notably, in this study, IOI recordings were based on the mother&rsquo;s recollection, thus were prone to recall bias. Furthermore, the study did not distinguish between induced and spontaneous abortion, obscuring any etiological conclusions. </p><p>A 2016 meta-analysis provides evidence for abandoning the WHO recommendation of a six-month minimal IPI following a miscarriage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpregnancy-interval-and-obstetrical-complications/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. The authors analyzed 10 studies including the large Latin American study described above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpregnancy-interval-and-obstetrical-complications/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. For preterm birth among women with IPI &lt;6 months following a miscarriage, the pooled relative risk was 0.93 (95% CI 0.58-1.48) when compared with an IPI of &ge;6 months. When the Latin American study was excluded, the pooled RR was 0.79 (95% CI 0.75-0.83) for the same comparison.

Interestingly, they were highest overall for IPIs of 27 to 50 months (9.0 percent) and nearly as high for those of 6 to 14 months (8.8 percent). Short IPI of less than six months after a life birth was associated with increased risk for stillbirth with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.61 (95% CI 1.20-2.18) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpregnancy-interval-and-obstetrical-complications/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. In another study by DaVanzo et al, short IPI of less than 15 months after a live birth and after a stillbirth was associated with increased risk for stillbirth with a relative risk of 2.19 and 1.85, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpregnancy-interval-and-obstetrical-complications/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].

A short IOI (less than 15 months) after a stillbirth has been reported to increase the probability of adverse perinatal complications, such as early neonatal mortality, possibly because of depletion of maternal nutrients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpregnancy-interval-and-obstetrical-complications/abstract/26,82\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,82</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27187296\"><span class=\"h2\">Maternal depression or anxiety</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In two studies, IOI less than seven months after missed or induced abortion was associated with an increased risk of maternal depression and anxiety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpregnancy-interval-and-obstetrical-complications/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27188095\"><span class=\"h1\">PREGNANCY COMPLICATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH IDI</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In contrast to interpregnancy interval (IPI) and inter-outcome interval (IOI), which mark the time between the end of one pregnancy and the beginning of the next pregnancy, the interdelivery interval (IDI) is defined as the period between consecutive live births. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1915438\"><span class=\"h2\">Trial of labor after cesarean delivery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A trial of labor after cesarean (TOLAC) has been associated with about a three-fold increase in risk of uterine rupture among women with short IDI up to 18 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpregnancy-interval-and-obstetrical-complications/abstract/84,85\" class=\"abstract_t\">84,85</a>].

This recommendation is based on accumulating data cited above that an IPI less than 18 months is associated with an increased risk of perinatal and maternal outcomes after a live birth, while an IPI of 18 to 24 months is associated with the lowest relative risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/interpregnancy-interval-and-obstetrical-complications/abstract/1,3,11,17,57,89\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,11,17,57,89</a>].
