The clinical course is highly variable, ranging from relatively mild cases characterized by the recurrent appearance of papules, pustules, and a few inflammatory nodules to severe cases demonstrating deep fluctuant abscesses, draining sinuses, and severe rope-like scars (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F90465\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef90465 \">picture 1A</a>).</p><p>The management and prognosis of HS will be reviewed here. Information on the pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis of HS and a detailed discussion of the surgical techniques used in the treatment of HS are provided separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hidradenitis-suppurativa-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hidradenitis suppurativa: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-hidradenitis-suppurativa\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of hidradenitis suppurativa&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H856174\"><span class=\"h1\">PRINCIPLES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pain, odor, drainage, and disfigurement caused by HS profoundly affects quality of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hidradenitis-suppurativa-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Patients often experience feelings of sadness or depression related to the disease, and feelings of shame may contribute to self-imposed social isolation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hidradenitis-suppurativa-treatment/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. Diagnostic delay, which averages seven years, combined with the significant physical and emotional toll of HS, may lead to patient frustration with medical care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hidradenitis-suppurativa-treatment/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H856823\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment goals</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Untreated, HS can remain active for many years after onset, which is typically in early adulthood. Interventions for HS target one or more of three major goals: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To reduce the frequency of new lesions, minimizing pain and suppuration</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To prevent disease progression by limiting the formation of scarring</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>To treat existing lesions and scarring, a goal which may require a combination of medical and surgical intervention</p><p/><p>More than 50 interventions exist for treatment of HS, including patient self-management strategies, topical therapy, oral systemic agents, biologic therapies, surgery, and laser and light interventions. Disease severity, patient tolerance of specific agents, comorbidities, and treatment cost and availability guide treatment choices. (See <a href=\"#H3023157\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16990907\"><span class=\"h2\">Staging systems</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Hurley clinical staging system is frequently utilized to describe the severity of HS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hidradenitis-suppurativa-treatment/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In accordance with this system, HS is divided into three stages:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Stage I </strong>&ndash; Abscess formation (single or multiple) without sinus tracts and <span class=\"nowrap\">cicatrization/scarring</span> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F90463\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef90463 \">picture 2</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Stage II </strong>&ndash; Recurrent abscesses with sinus tracts and scarring, single or multiple widely separated lesions (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F90464\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef90464 \">picture 3</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Stage III </strong>&ndash; Diffuse or almost diffuse involvement, or multiple interconnected tracts and abscesses across the entire area (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F90465%7EOBGYN%2F65188\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef90465 graphicRef65188 \">picture 1A-B</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H568473905\"><span class=\"h2\">Outcome measure instruments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Hurley staging system has insufficient responsiveness to change to be used as a clinical study outcome measure. The Sartorius scale [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hidradenitis-suppurativa-treatment/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] and modified Sartorius scale [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hidradenitis-suppurativa-treatment/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>] have been used in clinical trials, and a newer assessment tool, the Hidradenitis Suppurativa Clinical Response (HiSCR), has been developed and validated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hidradenitis-suppurativa-treatment/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. The <strong>HI</strong>dradenitis <strong>S</strong>uppura<strong>T</strong>iva c<strong>OR</strong>e outcomes set <strong>I</strong>nternational <strong>C</strong>ollaboration (HISTORIC) is developing a core domain set for HS trial outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hidradenitis-suppurativa-treatment/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>In a busy clinic setting, other instruments are useful for quickly assessing disease severity. Patients can complete a quality-of-life instrument, such as the Dermatology Life Quality Index or Skindex, and a pain visual analogue scale (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F82442\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef82442 \">form 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hidradenitis-suppurativa-treatment/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. They can also be asked to record the number of new or recurrent lesions occurring in the preceding month. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3023157\"><span class=\"h1\">TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The multifaceted clinical features of HS and the unpredictable course of the disease make a uniform approach to treatment challenging. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'General approaches'</a> below and <a href=\"#H2131349963\" class=\"local\">'Hurley stage I (mild disease)'</a> below and <a href=\"#H5758489\" class=\"local\">'Hurley stage II'</a> below and <a href=\"#H5758497\" class=\"local\">'Hurley stage III (severe and refractory disease)'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">General approaches</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Regardless of disease severity, attention to patient education and support, patient self-management, management of comorbidities, and pain management may be beneficial.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3378650836\"><span class=\"h3\">Education and support</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because HS is a psychologically distressing disorder that can have a major impact on patient quality of life, patient education and support are essential components of management. The clinician should inquire about the impact of the disease on the patient's quality of life and assess for symptoms of depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hidradenitis-suppurativa-treatment/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=screening-for-depression-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Screening for depression in adults&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Patients should be informed that the disease is neither contagious nor due to poor hygiene. Patients should also be offered resources for psychologic support [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hidradenitis-suppurativa-treatment/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], such as contact information for local HS patient societies. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1650560280\"><span class=\"h3\">Self-management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patient self-management is an important part of the approach to HS. Patients should be offered individualized self-management strategies.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Avoidance of skin trauma </strong>&ndash; Factors that promote skin maceration and follicular trauma may contribute to worsening of HS due to the promotion of inflammation, follicular occlusion, and follicular rupture. We advise patients to wear loose, light clothing and to actively avoid excessive heat, friction, and shearing trauma. Washing with loofahs or brushes should be avoided to prevent unnecessary skin trauma and irritation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Dressings </strong>&ndash;<strong> </strong>Whether dressing untreated but actively draining lesions or the postoperative wound, dressings should be selected that minimize skin trauma. To prevent absorbent dressings from sticking to the wound, simple white petrolatum can be applied. Adhesive tape should be avoided, and instead, elastic fishnet dressings can be customized to hold absorbent material in place. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Smoking cessation </strong>&ndash; Smoking is commonly associated with HS. The case for smoking as a causative factor is strengthening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hidradenitis-suppurativa-treatment/abstract/8,15-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,15-18</a>], and documentation of improvement in HS after smoking cessation has appeared in a few case reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hidradenitis-suppurativa-treatment/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Despite the fact that the impact of smoking cessation on HS is untested by clinical trials, this observed association, the observed increase in risk for cardiovascular-associated death among patients with HS compared with patients without the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hidradenitis-suppurativa-treatment/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>], and the overall negative impact of smoking on health lead us to routinely discourage smoking and other nicotine use. Ideally, smoking cessation support should be offered as part of the multidisciplinary approach to HS management. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hidradenitis-suppurativa-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H259634222\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hidradenitis suppurativa: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Associated factors'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-smoking-cessation-management-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of smoking cessation management in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=behavioral-approaches-to-smoking-cessation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Behavioral approaches to smoking cessation&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Weight management</strong> &ndash; As with smoking, excess weight has been linked to HS, but a causative association between weight and HS has not been definitively established [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hidradenitis-suppurativa-treatment/abstract/8,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,15,16</a>]. Factors related to excess weight, such as skin occlusion, skin friction, shearing forces on skin, hyperinsulinemia and other hormonal changes that can occur in association with excess weight, and dietary factors appear to be contributing factors in HS. Thus, we encourage and support weight management in our HS patients. In addition, we sometimes prescribe <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metformin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metformin</a>, an antidiabetes drug that may be beneficial for HS and may have a modest effect on weight loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hidradenitis-suppurativa-treatment/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hidradenitis-suppurativa-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H259634222\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hidradenitis suppurativa: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Associated factors'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=obesity-in-adults-overview-of-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Obesity in adults: Overview of management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H258765185\" class=\"local\">'Metformin'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Data are emerging regarding the effect of substantial weight loss in obese HS patients. In a retrospective survey of 45 Danish patients who had undergone bariatric surgery, 35 achieved substantial weight loss, defined as at least a 15 percent reduction in baseline body mass index, and, of these, 17 experienced resolution of their HS, 7 were improved, and 11 had unchanged or worsened disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hidradenitis-suppurativa-treatment/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Removal of excess skin following substantial weight loss may be required to prevent disease exacerbations related to increased frictional effects.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Antiseptics</strong> &ndash;<strong> </strong>Topical antiseptic washes such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chlorhexidine-gluconate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">chlorhexidine</a> 4% may be helpful for HS. Chlorhexidine can be used for showering, beginning with once per week use and increasing up to once daily as tolerated. In addition, some patients find emollients containing benzalkonium chloride, an antimicrobial agent, to be helpful. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2790690311\"><span class=\"h3\">Management of comorbidities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with HS may be at increased risk for alcohol dependence, arthropathies, autoimmune conditions, cardiovascular risk, diabetes, drug dependence, dyslipidemia, follicular syndromes, hypertension, lymphoma, malignancies, metabolic syndrome, nicotine addiction, obesity, polycystic ovarian syndrome, psychiatric and psychologic disorders, rheumatologic conditions, and thyroid disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hidradenitis-suppurativa-treatment/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hidradenitis-suppurativa-pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H106560796\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hidradenitis suppurativa: Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Associated disorders and syndromes'</a>.)</p><p>Multidisciplinary management of comorbidities can improve patient outcomes. Recommendations from a multispecialty working group for the management of comorbidities, including cardiovascular risk factors, excess weight, inflammatory bowel disease, inflammatory joint disorders, psychologic disorders, alcohol use, and tobacco use, in patients with HS have been published [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hidradenitis-suppurativa-treatment/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The document provides guidance for dermatologists for patient assessment and referral and reviews the implications of treatments for HS on comorbidities. We agree with the importance of assessing for comorbidities on a yearly basis and support multidisciplinary involvement in the management of comorbidities. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2961140144\"><span class=\"h3\">Pain management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Pain from HS nodules and abscesses may cause sleep disturbance, limit function, and induce psychologic distress. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories can be used to treat both pain and inflammation. Additional analgesia, including opioid analgesia, may be needed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-treatment-of-chronic-non-cancer-pain\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the treatment of chronic non-cancer pain&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2131349963\"><span class=\"h2\">Hurley stage I (mild disease)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Local therapy combined with the general approaches described above is the preferred treatment of mild HS (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F90463\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef90463 \">picture 2</a>). (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'General approaches'</a> above.) </p><p>Useful local measures include topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a>, intralesional corticosteroid injections, punch debridement, and topical resorcinol. When these measures are insufficient, oral tetracyclines may be beneficial.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H41836960\"><span class=\"h3\">Topical clindamycin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a> is often utilized as a first-line therapy for mild HS. A randomized three-month trial supported its efficacy for mild inflammatory lesions and demonstrated the relative safety and tolerability of this regimen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hidradenitis-suppurativa-treatment/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Patients with mild HS were treated with twice-daily applications of clindamycin 1% solution (13 patients) or vehicle (14 patients). Treatment efficacy was assessed with an unvalidated scoring system that was designed to assess the amount of disease. The trial found that the cumulative disease burden score improved to a significantly greater degree in patients treated with topical clindamycin than in patients who were given placebo at all study time points (one, two, and three months after the start of treatment). Treatment with clindamycin was well tolerated; two patients treated with clindamycin 1% solution and three patients treated with vehicle solution reported slight burning sensations at the sites of treatment. &#160; </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1460227017\"><span class=\"h3\">Intralesional corticosteroids</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intralesional corticosteroid therapy is often useful as an adjunctive therapy for reducing symptoms of HS. The intent of treatment is to accelerate the resolution of early, painful inflammatory lesions. A prospective series of 36 HS patients designed to assess the effect of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=triamcinolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">triamcinolone</a> 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/mL</span> (volume range 0.2 to 2 mL) injected into an acute nodule or abscess supports this approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hidradenitis-suppurativa-treatment/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. Mean pain, measured on a visual analogue scale (VAS) from 0 to 10, where 10 represents greatest pain, decreased from 5.5 pretreatment to 1.1 at follow-up after a mean of seven days. Significant differences in pain VAS were found between days 0 and 1 and also from day 1 to day 2 after the injection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intralesional-injection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intralesional injection&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2004775509\"><span class=\"h3\">Punch debridement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Performance of punch debridement (partial deroofing) to evacuate a new inflamed nodule that is centered around a single folliculopilosebaceous unit (FPSU) can be effective for eliminating new lesions. Simple incision and drainage are usually not performed because incised nodules usually recur. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-hidradenitis-suppurativa#H1487130165\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of hidradenitis suppurativa&quot;, section on 'Punch debridement'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-management-of-hidradenitis-suppurativa#H532236330\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical management of hidradenitis suppurativa&quot;, section on 'Role for I&amp;D'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3076839373\"><span class=\"h3\">Topical resorcinol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Resorcinol is a topical chemical peeling agent with keratolytic and anti-inflammatory properties that is used by some clinicians for HS. Topical 15% resorcinol in a proprietary cream base is applied directly to inflammatory nodules. </p><p>In an open study of 12 patients with Hurley stage I or stage II HS who applied topical 15% resorcinol once to twice daily primarily during disease flares, all patients experienced a reduction in pain and a reduction in duration of painful abscesses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hidradenitis-suppurativa-treatment/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The expected adverse effect of local desquamation occurred in all patients. Recurrences may follow discontinuation of the medication. </p><p>Patients can be instructed to apply a thin film of resorcinol 15% cream directly to a new inflamed nodule twice daily. Resorcinol is <strong>not</strong> applied to the entire region. As improvement occurs, the frequency of application may be tapered to once daily and application to the site of the inflamed nodule can be discontinued upon resolution.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2631121958\"><span class=\"h2\">Systemic antibiotics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Short courses (eg, seven days) of penicillin-type antibiotics do not appear to alter the natural history of an acute HS lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hidradenitis-suppurativa-treatment/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. In addition, multiple short antibiotic courses may promote bacterial resistance. A strategy endorsed by the European HS guidelines is to give a more prolonged course of an oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tetracycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tetracycline</a> such as lymecycline or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=doxycycline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">doxycycline</a>, with the treatment goal to prevent or reduce the frequency of new lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hidradenitis-suppurativa-treatment/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].
