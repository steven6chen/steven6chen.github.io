It is important to recognize that most women do not schedule a preconception care visit. Factors that facilitate provision of preconception care include the availability of preconception care screening tools; patient informational resources such as brochures and handouts; and waiting room posters outlining the benefits and availability of preconception care consultations. </p><p>This topic will discuss preconception care.

It is especially important to elicit exposure to dietary supplements (eg, herbal supplements), as patients may not perceive them as medications that can be harmful to the fetus.

Therefore, the potential risk of medication use has to be considered on a case-by-case basis in terms of the harm of discontinuing the drug and the availability of alternative drugs.</p><p>Although it makes intuitive sense that identifying and treating medical conditions, including mental health issues, prior to pregnancy is beneficial, few randomized trials have evaluated the efficacy of preconception health promotion interventions for improving pregnancy outcome.</p><p>The gynecologic and obstetric histories are important for identifying factors that may contribute to infertility or complications in a future pregnancy and initiating appropriate intervention to reduce or eliminate these risks, if possible [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-preconception-office-visit/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].
