Upon deoxygenation, HbS molecules polymerize into intracellular fibers, forming a high molecular weight gel and causing the sickle cell deformity. This process initiates an elaborate and incompletely understood pathophysiological cascade that includes injury to the sickle red cell; intravascular and extravascular hemolysis; adhesive interactions among sickle cells, endothelial cells, other blood cells, and plasma factors; reperfusion injury; and inflammation. As a result of this cascade, vital tissues are injured, impairing their function, causing localized pain (ie, the sickle cell vaso-oclusive crisis) and, in many cases, premature death for the affected individual.</p><p>The clinical features of SCA are exceptionally heterogeneous. As in most &quot;single-gene&quot; disorders, clinical heterogeneity is influenced by other genes that shape its intermediate phenotypes. The products of modifier genes, sometimes called epistatic genes, are also likely to interact, thus determining the specific phenotype within each affected family and patient (eg, stroke risk, other vaso-occlusive events, HbF level, response to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyurea</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-variability-in-sickle-cell-anemia/abstract/1-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-4</a>].

The variability of sickle cell disorders due to the simultaneous inheritance of the gene for HbS from one parent and a different beta chain variant or beta thalassemia from the other (ie, a compound heterozygous genotype) is discussed separately.

In the absence of transfusion, HbA is not present, since in SCA both beta globin genes code for HbS. Even in its fully oxygenated state, the viscosity of sickle cell blood, due to increased internal viscosity of the erythrocyte, as well as a reduction in red cell membrane deformability, is 1.5-fold that of normal red cells at an equivalent packed cell volume, and is increased to 10-fold that of normal red cells on deoxygenation.</p><p>Several factors under varying degrees of genetic control may contribute to the SCA phenotype, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased production of HbF <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> HbA2, both of which inhibit HbS polymer formation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Decreased cell density, as can occur when alpha thalassemia is also present, leading to reduced HbS polymer, reduced internal viscosity of the red cell and improved red cell survival (ie, decreased hemolysis).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduced overall oxygen affinity of the sickle cell. Levels of 2,3-BPG are increased, although the major effect on oxygen affinity is due to intracellular polymerization of the HbS molecule. This can lead to hemoglobin desaturation at various sites, including pulmonary capillaries, arterial blood, and systemic capillary beds.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Extreme sensitivity of the sol-to-gel transition of HbS to changes in cellular hydration. Dehydration, which increases the mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), significantly decreases the time needed to form the sickle polymer, which may be critical when the cell is traversing systemic capillary beds and releasing oxygen to the tissues.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Damage to the red cell membrane, including both physical and oxidative challenges [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-variability-in-sickle-cell-anemia/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Interaction between red cell membrane antigens and circulating plasma proteins, leukocytes, the vascular endothelium, and cytokine release patterns.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Variability of intravascular hemolysis that leads to nitric oxide (NO) scavenging and reduced NO availability.

The drug reduced hemolysis and increased hemoglobin concentration as expected, but there appeared to be an increase in vaso-occlusive complications. Perhaps this was an effect of increased packed cell volume and blood viscosity.

As HbA2 levels rarely exceed 5 percent in sickle cell disease, the antipolymerization effects of this molecule are minor compared with HbF, whose levels can naturally exceed 20 percent.

HbF levels are normally set by genetic control mechanisms involving silencing of the gamma-globin genes, transcriptional control of gamma-globin gene expression, and erythroid progenitor cell proliferation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-variability-in-sickle-cell-anemia/abstract/15,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,28</a>]. Genetic variation in the cis- and trans-acting factors that regulate HbF expression may account for some disease heterogeneity in SCA.

Cluster one had elevated leukocyte counts and total bilirubin, lower hemoglobin concentrations, an increased incidence of acute chest syndrome, and decreased survival after three years.

In one study of patients with SCA, plasma NO metabolite concentrations were increased during acute painful episodes and during the &quot;steady state&quot; compared with normal controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-variability-in-sickle-cell-anemia/abstract/110\" class=\"abstract_t\">110</a>]. Inhibition of the NO pathway using the NO synthase inhibitor L-NAME increased the adhesion of sickle cells in the rat cerebral microcirculation and, in some experiments, resulted in reduced or occluded flow. These studies suggest that the NO pathway is critical in maintaining cerebral blood flow in the presence of sickle erythrocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-variability-in-sickle-cell-anemia/abstract/111\" class=\"abstract_t\">111</a>].</p><p>NO products released from cultured pulmonary artery and microvascular endothelial cells exposed to erythrocytes and plasma from patients with SCA taken during episodes of acute chest syndrome or during painful episodes were increased 5- to 14-fold and were accompanied by increased eNOS protein and enzymatic activity, but not increased NOS3 or NOS2 gene transcripts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-variability-in-sickle-cell-anemia/abstract/112\" class=\"abstract_t\">112</a>]. This increase may reflect not only increased NO production but also an increase in oxidant stress along with oxidative inactivation of NO, with resultant production of damaging oxidative molecules.</p><p>Hemolytic anemia may be the driving force behind some complications of SCA because of its effects on NO bioavailability. Under normal circumstances, NO binds soluble guanylate cyclase, which converts GTP to cGMP, relaxing vascular smooth muscle and causing vasodilatation. Plasma hemoglobin liberated from intravascularly destroyed sickle erythrocytes consumes NO, producing methemoglobin and bio-inactive nitrate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-variability-in-sickle-cell-anemia/abstract/113\" class=\"abstract_t\">113</a>]. This state of reduced endothelial NO bioavailability in SCA impairs downstream homeostatic vascular functions of NO, such as the inhibition of platelet activation and aggregation and transcriptional repression of some cell adhesion molecules. (See <a href=\"#H30\" class=\"local\">'G6PD Deficiency'</a> below.)</p><p>Hemoglobin, heme, and heme iron catalyze the production of oxygen radicals and protein nitration, further limiting NO bioavailability and activating endothelium. Lysed erythrocytes also liberate arginase that destroys L-arginine, the substrate for NO production, providing another mechanism for endothelial NO deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-variability-in-sickle-cell-anemia/abstract/114\" class=\"abstract_t\">114</a>].

The normal balance between vasoconstriction and vasodilation is therefore skewed toward vasoconstriction, endothelial activation, and proliferation. Clinically, these hemolysis-driven phenotypes include pulmonary hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-variability-in-sickle-cell-anemia/abstract/116\" class=\"abstract_t\">116</a>], priapism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-variability-in-sickle-cell-anemia/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>], leg ulcers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-variability-in-sickle-cell-anemia/abstract/117\" class=\"abstract_t\">117</a>], and stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-variability-in-sickle-cell-anemia/abstract/118\" class=\"abstract_t\">118</a>].</p><p>These processes are all likely to be genetically modulated.
