The clinical expression of G6PD variants encompasses a spectrum of hemolytic syndromes. Affected patients are most often asymptomatic, but many patients have episodic anemia, while a few have chronic hemolysis.</p><p>With most G6PD variants, hemolysis is induced in children and adults by the sudden destruction of older, more deficient erythrocytes after exposure to drugs having a high redox potential (including the antimalarial drug <a href=\"topic.htm?path=primaquine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">primaquine</a> and certain sulfa drugs) or to fava beans, selected infections, or metabolic abnormalities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F74254\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74254 \">table 1</a>). However, in the neonate with G6PD deficiency, decreased bilirubin elimination may play an important role in the development of jaundice (see <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Jaundice in neonates'</a> below)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-and-pathophysiology-of-glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase-g6pd-deficiency/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].</p><p>Normal enzyme function and the genetics and pathophysiology of G6PD deficiency, including its possible role in protecting against severe malaria, will be reviewed here. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of this disorder are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-management-of-glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase-deficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and management of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A historical review of the discovery of this defect, its clinical manifestations, detection, population genetics, and molecular biology, written by Dr. Ernest Beutler, a pioneer in the understanding of this disorder, is available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-and-pathophysiology-of-glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase-g6pd-deficiency/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">FUNCTION OF G6PD</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase catalyzes the initial step in the hexose monophosphate (HMP or pentose phosphate) shunt, oxidizing glucose-6-phosphate to 6-phosphogluconolactone and reducing nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) to NADPH (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F77081\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77081 \">figure 1</a>). The HMP shunt is the only red cell source of NADPH, a cofactor important in glutathione metabolism.</p><p>The main function of the HMP shunt is to protect red blood cells against oxidative injury via the production of NADPH. Red blood cells contain relatively high concentrations of reduced glutathione (GSH), a sulfhydryl-containing tripeptide that functions as an intracellular reducing agent, thereby protecting against oxidant injury. Oxidants, such as superoxide anion (O2-) and hydrogen peroxide, are formed within red cells via reactions of hemoglobin with oxygen and can also be produced by exogenous factors such as drugs and infection. If these oxidants accumulate within red cells, hemoglobin and other proteins are oxidized (see below), leading to loss of function and cell death.</p><p>Under normal circumstances, oxidant accumulation does not occur, since these compounds are rapidly inactivated by GSH in conjunction with glutathione peroxidase. These reactions result in the conversion of GSH to oxidized glutathione (GSSG). GSH levels are restored by glutathione reductase which catalyzes the reduction of GSSG to GSH. This reaction requires the NADPH generated by G6PD.</p><p>Thus, tight coupling of the HMP shunt to glutathione metabolism is responsible for protecting intracellular proteins from oxidative injury. Almost all hemolytic episodes related to altered HMP shunt and glutathione metabolism are due to G6PD deficiency. Rarely, hemolysis results from deficiencies in GSH synthetic enzymes.

Even though females have two X chromosomes per cell, males and females have the same enzyme activity in their red cells because one of the X chromosomes in each cell of the female embryo is inactivated and remains inactive throughout subsequent cell divisions (Lyon hypothesis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-and-pathophysiology-of-glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase-g6pd-deficiency/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>G6PD deficiency is expressed in males carrying a variant gene, while heterozygous females are usually clinically normal. However, the mean red blood cell enzyme activity in heterozygous females may be normal, moderately reduced, or grossly deficient depending upon the degree of lyonization and the degree to which the abnormal G6PD variant is expressed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-and-pathophysiology-of-glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase-g6pd-deficiency/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. A heterozygous female with 50 percent normal G6PD activity has 50 percent normal red cells and 50 percent G6PD-deficient red cells. The deficient cells are as vulnerable to hemolysis as the enzyme-deficient red blood cells in males.</p><p>It is of interest that the incidence of G6PD deficiency in Chinese females &ge;80 years of age was several-fold greater than what was expected from population screening at birth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-and-pathophysiology-of-glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase-g6pd-deficiency/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

Amino acid 205 is the binding site for glucose-6-phosphate, while amino acids 386 and 387 may be involved in binding to NADP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-and-pathophysiology-of-glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase-g6pd-deficiency/abstract/15,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,17</a>].</p><p>The normal or wild-type enzyme is called G6PD B, although over 400 variant enzymes have been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-and-pathophysiology-of-glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase-g6pd-deficiency/abstract/15,16,18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16,18,19</a>]. By international agreement, standardized methods have been used to characterize these enzyme variants, which differ on the basis of their biochemical properties, such as kinetic activity and the Michaelis constant for its substrate glucose-6-phosphate and cofactor NADP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-and-pathophysiology-of-glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase-g6pd-deficiency/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].

Thus, the entire red blood cell population of subjects with G6PD Mediterranean is susceptible to oxidant-induced injury, which can lead to severe hemolytic anemia.

The severity of jaundice varies widely, from being subclinical to imposing the threat of kernicterus if it is not treated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-and-pathophysiology-of-glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase-g6pd-deficiency/abstract/5,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,6</a>].

Neither G6PD deficiency nor presence of the variant Gilbert polymorphism alone increased the incidence of hyperbilirubinemia (incidence: 7 to 15 percent) over subjects with normal alleles at these two loci (incidence: 10 percent), but both defects in combination did (incidence: 32 to 50 percent).

However, this abnormality is rarely associated with functional impairment of leukocytes and platelets due to their normally short survival. As an example, phagocytic and bactericidal activity of granulocytes are typically normal in deficient subjects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-and-pathophysiology-of-glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase-g6pd-deficiency/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>].</p><p>Rare kindreds with severe enzymatic deficiency of G6PD (ie, &lt;5 percent of normal) may have decreased respiratory burst activity due to a lack of NADPH production in phagocytes, leading to symptoms of chronic granulomatous disease and increased susceptibility to infection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-and-pathophysiology-of-glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase-g6pd-deficiency/abstract/53,54\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,54</a>].

This is compatible with the demonstration that invasion is normal but in vitro growth of malarial parasites is inhibited in G6PD-deficient red cells in female heterozygotes; there are conflicting data as to inhibition of parasite growth in male hemizygotes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-and-pathophysiology-of-glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase-g6pd-deficiency/abstract/61,62\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Somewhat different findings were noted in a study of the Mediterranean variant of G6PD-deficient red cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-and-pathophysiology-of-glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase-g6pd-deficiency/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. With five different strains of P. falciparum, there were no significant differences in either invasion or maturation within deficient and normal red cells. However, among red cells that were parasitized at the ring stage (but not the more mature trophozoite stage), phagocytosis occurred 2.3 times more intensely in the G6PD-deficient cells in association with a marked reduction in reduced glutathione (GSH).</p><p/><p>The mechanisms responsible for inhibition of parasite growth or increased phagocytosis in G6PD-deficient red cells are not known. One possibility is that oxidant stress, which causes GSH instability and destroys the host red cells, also kills the parasite [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-and-pathophysiology-of-glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase-g6pd-deficiency/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Although the parasite may provide a small amount of G6PD activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-and-pathophysiology-of-glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase-g6pd-deficiency/abstract/64-66\" class=\"abstract_t\">64-66</a>], it is insufficient to compensate for the enzyme deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-and-pathophysiology-of-glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase-g6pd-deficiency/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Similarly, oxidant stress in the presence of diminished GSH in ring stage infected, G6PD-deficient cells may cause membrane damage that promotes phagocytosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-and-pathophysiology-of-glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase-g6pd-deficiency/abstract/63,67,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,67,68</a>].</p><p>An alternative explanation is that infected, G6PD-deficient red cells are, due to the low levels of GSH, unable to generate the ribose derivatives needed by the parasite for nucleic acid synthesis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/genetics-and-pathophysiology-of-glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase-g6pd-deficiency/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].
