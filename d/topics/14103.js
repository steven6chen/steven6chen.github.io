There is a wide range of clinical severity associated with MFS. Although many clinicians view the disorder in terms of classic ocular, cardiovascular, and musculoskeletal abnormalities, these patients also demonstrate significant involvement of the lungs, skin, and central nervous system.</p><p>Pregnancy and the postpartum period is a high-risk time for aortic dissection and rupture in women with MFS. The increased risk may be due to increased arterial wall stress associated with the hypervolemic and hyperdynamic circulatory state <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hormonal effects on aortic wall composition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-and-marfan-syndrome/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Aortic root dilatation can also lead to worsening aortic regurgitation.</p><p>The management of pregnancy in women with MFS and related disorders will be reviewed here. The genetics, pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management of MFS and related disorders are discussed separately. The management of pregnancy in women with bicuspid aortic valve is also discussed separately.

These patients require specialized management prior to, during, and following pregnancy, including delivery and the postpartum period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-and-marfan-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p>Women and men with MFS should receive counseling regarding the risk of transmission (generally autosomal dominant) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-and-marfan-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The 50 percent chance of transmission from an affected parent to her or his child, phenotypic variability, and the availability of prenatal diagnostic testing should be discussed. </p><p>Discussion should include potential alternatives to pregnancy (childlessness, adoption, and use of a gestational carrier or surrogate pregnancy).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3281746506\"><span class=\"h2\">Prenatal genetic testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The availability and limitations of prenatal diagnostic testing should be discussed, ideally prior to conception. Prenatal diagnostic testing is feasible if a disease-causing mutation has been identified in the family. However, the severity of disease in a child who inherits a mutation in the <em>FBN1</em> gene is unpredictable. Analysis of the <em>FBN1</em> gene from cells or tissue obtained during preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) using in vitro fertilization techniques, amniocentesis, or chorionic villus sampling can also be informative. However, such analyses are time consuming, costly (generally not covered by insurance carriers), and carry a risk to the fetus. Planning for them should ideally be done prior to conception. Resources for genetic testing are discussed in more detail elsewhere.

In addition, imaging of the entire aorta by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, as well as consultation with a cardiologist, maternal-fetal medicine specialist, and geneticist is recommended in order to provide comprehensive data that will inform the risks of pregnancy to her and her offspring [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-and-marfan-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=echocardiographic-evaluation-of-the-thoracic-and-proximal-abdominal-aorta#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Echocardiographic evaluation of the thoracic and proximal abdominal aorta&quot;, section on 'Two-dimensional echocardiography'</a>.)</p><p>Pregnant women with MFS with aortic root dilatation are at increased risk for aortic dissection <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> rupture, although a normal dimension does not exclude the possibility of dissection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-and-marfan-syndrome/abstract/2,4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,5</a>]. The risk of aortic rupture or dissection during pregnancy is difficult to quantify, since limited data are available. Complications can occur at any time during pregnancy, but are most often seen after the second trimester or during the postpartum period [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-and-marfan-syndrome/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. There is general agreement that risk increases with larger aortic root diameters.</p><p>The risk of dissection or other serious complications such as endocarditis or heart failure has been estimated to be approximately 1 percent in women with MFS with an aortic root diameter &le;40 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-and-marfan-syndrome/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. Women with MFS with an aortic root diameter &gt;40 mm <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> rapidly increasing aortic root size (&gt;5 mm per year) are at increased risk of dissection and adverse cardiovascular outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-and-marfan-syndrome/abstract/3,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,6</a>]. Women with a previous aortic dissection are particularly concerning and are likely at high risk for complications during pregnancy, but there are insufficient data to quantify the risk. One series included two women with a previous aortic dissection, one of whom developed another dissection during pregnancy despite having undergone aortic root replacement after the first event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-and-marfan-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>In addition to the risk of complications during pregnancy, limited data suggest that pregnancy may increase the long-term rate of aortic dilatation in women with MFS. One small study of women with MFS found a higher rate of aortic root growth in those who experienced pregnancy compared with controls that had not been pregnant (0.36 versus 0.14 mm per year) only among those with baseline aortic diameter &ge;40 mm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-and-marfan-syndrome/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In a larger study of women with MFS, aortic root size was significantly larger among women who had experienced pregnancy compared with controls who had not been pregnant, though baseline aortic root sizes were similar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-and-marfan-syndrome/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. In addition, in a subset of women with echocardiograms prior to, during, and after pregnancy, the rate of aortic root growth increased significantly during pregnancy and declined following delivery though remaining above the baseline rate. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21872254\"><span class=\"h1\">ELECTIVE REPAIR PRIOR TO CONCEPTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For women with Marfan syndrome (MFS) with an aortic root diameter &ge;45 mm (or &gt;27 <span class=\"nowrap\">mm/m<sup>2</sup>),</span> we agree with the 2011 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines (similar to earlier American and Canadian guidelines), which suggest elective repair prior to conception, although limited supporting data are available [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-and-marfan-syndrome/abstract/3,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8</a>]. This approach differs somewhat from the 2010 American College of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/American</span> Heart <span class=\"nowrap\">Association/American</span> Association of Thoracic Surgeons <span class=\"nowrap\">(ACC/AHA/AATS)</span> guidelines suggesting that elective repair is reasonable if the aortic diameter exceeds 40 mm in women with MFS who are contemplating pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-and-marfan-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p>Although the risk of ascending aortic dissection is reduced with successful surgical correction, there is a risk of aortic dissection in the remaining aorta during subsequent pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-and-marfan-syndrome/abstract/4,7,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,7,10</a>]. Data are insufficient to estimate this risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-and-marfan-syndrome/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT DURING PREGNANCY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among women with Marfan syndrome (MFS) who become pregnant, a multidisciplinary approach to prenatal care is recommended, preferably at a center with experience in the management of patients with MFS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-and-marfan-syndrome/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Monitoring</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Serial clinical assessment should include echocardiographic monitoring in all pregnant women with MFS, even among women with baseline aortic root diameter &le;40 mm, assuming the ascending aorta can be adequately visualized using echocardiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-and-marfan-syndrome/abstract/2,4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,4,5</a>]. The frequency of clinical and imaging follow-up should be individualized depending on patient characteristics. The 2011 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Guidelines suggest repeat echocardiographic imaging every four to eight weeks during pregnancy in patients with aortic root or ascending aorta dilatation (diameter &gt;40 mm) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-and-marfan-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Similarly, the 2010 American College of <span class=\"nowrap\">Cardiology/American</span> Heart <span class=\"nowrap\">Association/American</span> Association of Thoracic Surgeons <span class=\"nowrap\">(ACC/AHA/AATS)</span> guidelines recommend monthly or bimonthly echocardiographic measurement of the aortic root and ascending aortic dimensions in this setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-and-marfan-syndrome/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p>As noted in the 2011 ESC and 2010 <span class=\"nowrap\">ACC/AHA/AATS</span> guidelines, magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is recommended over computed tomography (CT) for pregnant women with aortic arch, descending or abdominal aortic dilatation, to avoid exposing the mother and fetus to ionizing radiation. MR imaging without gadolinium contrast is preferred and is generally sufficient for monitoring aortic size, although limited data suggest that if required the fetal risk of gadolinium may be minimal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-and-marfan-syndrome/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-imaging-procedures-during-pregnancy#H26\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic imaging procedures during pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Magnetic resonance imaging'</a>). Transesophageal echocardiography is an alternative for imaging the thoracic aorta.</p><p>Aortic measurement methods are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-marfan-syndrome-and-related-disorders#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of Marfan syndrome and related disorders&quot;, section on 'How to measure'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Medical therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Beta blockers should be given during pregnancy to all MFS patients in an attempt to minimize aortic dilatation and risk of aortic dissection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-and-marfan-syndrome/abstract/3,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,10</a>]. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=labetalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Labetalol</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoprolol</a> are the preferred beta blockers in pregnant women since <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atenolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atenolol</a> may impair fetal growth. </p><p>Strict blood pressure control is recommended for all pregnant women with MFS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-and-marfan-syndrome/abstract/3,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,9</a>]. Dose adjustment of therapy for aortic preservation is suggested when the systolic blood pressure exceeds 130 mmHg. Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin II receptor blockers are teratogens and thus contraindicated during pregnancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-hypertension-in-pregnant-and-postpartum-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of hypertension in pregnant and postpartum women&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=angiotensin-converting-enzyme-inhibitors-and-receptor-blockers-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and receptor blockers in pregnancy&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Antibiotic prophylaxis is optional at delivery (unless bacteremia is suspected) for patients with prior valve replacement surgery or prior endocarditis.

Considerations include the potential maternal and fetal risks of aortic dissection and the risks and benefits of surgery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-pregnant-patient-undergoing-nonobstetric-surgery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the pregnant patient undergoing nonobstetric surgery&quot;</a>.)</p><p>If an aortic root diameter greater than 45 mm is detected during pregnancy, some authorities recommend consideration of termination of pregnancy if identification occurs prior to fetal viability, followed by prompt aortic repair; this approach is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-and-marfan-syndrome/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p>Intervention for Type B aortic dissection during pregnancy is occasionally needed; nonsurgical methods are preferred and appear to be the safest approach for mother and fetus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-and-marfan-syndrome/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Delivery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given the risk of aortic dissection and other cardiovascular complications, women with MFS with aortic root aneurysm (aortic root &ge;40 mm) or history of aortic dissection should be delivered at an institution where cardiothoracic surgery is available, although it could be argued that this is a reasonable practice for all women with MFS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-and-marfan-syndrome/abstract/3,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,9</a>].</p><p>There is no strong consensus regarding the preferred mode of delivery for women with MFS since scant evidence is available. The European Society of Cardiology&nbsp;guidelines&nbsp;suggest vaginal delivery in women with MFS who have an ascending aorta diameter &lt;40 mm<em> </em>and no other high-risk features,&nbsp;vaginal delivery utilizing epidural anesthesia with either an expedited second stage or delayed pushing to minimize Valsalva in women with MFS who have an ascending aorta diameter &ge;40 mm and &le;45 mm (though some prefer cesarean section in this setting), and cesarean delivery in women with MFS who have an ascending aorta diameter &gt;45 mm<em> </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-and-marfan-syndrome/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]<em>. </em>We do not believe that there is sufficient information to endorse any general recommendations and that the method of delivery should be carefully considered and individualized. More specifically, general obstetric principles should be applied to select the least hemodynamically stressful mode of delivery in the context of the particular pregnancy at hand unless there is an overriding specific obstetric indication for cesarean delivery. This approach is in keeping with the position of the Professional Advisory Board of the Marfan Foundation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-and-marfan-syndrome/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>With vaginal delivery, epidural anesthesia to minimize pain, outlet forceps or vacuum delivery without maternal pushing, and continued use of a beta blocker during labor are appropriate ancillary measures to minimize surges in blood pressure and cardiac output. In patients assessed to be at high risk for labor complications that may induce hemodynamic stress, a planned cesarean delivery may be preferred. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anesthesia-for-labor-and-delivery-in-high-risk-heart-disease-general-considerations\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Anesthesia for labor and delivery in high-risk heart disease: General considerations&quot;</a>.) </p><p>As noted below, Type A aortic dissection is an indication for urgent cesarean delivery if the fetus is viable, followed by or with simultaneous aortic repair. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Aortic dissection'</a> below.) </p><p>Prior to attempting epidural anesthesia, the presence of dural ectasia should be considered [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-and-marfan-syndrome/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Dural sac dilation can be present in up to 90 percent of patients with MFS and may be asymptomatic or associated with low back pain, headache, or proximal leg pain, weakness, or numbness. Dural ectasia can be visualized by lumbosacral MR imaging or CT studies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F95679\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef95679 \">image 1</a>), generally performed prior to conception as part of comprehensive aortic imaging. Although dural ectasia is not an absolute contraindication for epidural anesthesia, the increased risk of dural puncture or inadequate anesthesia should be discussed with the patient. It has been recommended that the epidural technique be performed in the lateral decubitus position to decrease the possibility of extension of the ectatic dural sac into the epidural space [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-and-marfan-syndrome/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. It is important to recognize that an increased amount of cerebrospinal fluid volume is generally present with dural ectasia, which may lead to spinal anesthesia failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-and-marfan-syndrome/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Consultation with an experienced obstetrical anesthesiologist is recommended prior to delivery to determine the type of anesthetic and management strategy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=genetics-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-marfan-syndrome-and-related-disorders#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Genetics, clinical features, and diagnosis of Marfan syndrome and related disorders&quot;, section on 'Dural ectasia'</a>.)</p><p>Obstetric complications appear to be increased in women with MFS. This was illustrated in a retrospective multicenter study of 111 completed pregnancies among 63 women with MFS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-and-marfan-syndrome/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. There was a high rate of premature deliveries (15 percent), mainly due to preterm premature rupture of membranes and cervical insufficiency, which resulted in a markedly increased combined rate of fetal and neonatal mortality (7 percent; 5 percent accounted for by preterm premature rupture of membranes). For comparison, in the United States general population the preterm birth rate is approximately 12 percent, neonatal mortality is approximately 0.4 percent and fetal mortality is approximately 0.7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-and-marfan-syndrome/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Postpartum hemorrhage and uterine inversion have also been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-and-marfan-syndrome/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H93539807\"><span class=\"h2\">Postpartum</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Due to the increased risk of aortic dissection postpartum, we suggest monitoring patients with MFS for complications during the first four to six weeks postpartum. Postpartum follow-up should be individualized and may range from one visit for low-risk patients to weekly follow-up with imaging during the first few weeks for high-risk patients. Patients should be alerted to present promptly for evaluation and imaging should symptoms of persistent chest or back discomfort occur.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Aortic dissection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis and management of aortic dissection that occurs during pregnancy or the postpartum period are similar to that for aortic dissection in general.</p><p>Given the lethal nature of aortic dissection, prompt diagnosis and intervention are critical. Confirming the diagnosis is the first objective and the availability, reliability, and speed of CT often make this the test of choice in pregnant patients presenting with a high clinical suspicion for aortic dissection. Patients presenting with an intermediate or low clinical suspicion of aortic dissection can be evaluated by other methods. Due to concerns about ionizing radiation (CT) during pregnancy, transesophageal echocardiogram or MR aortic imaging may be the initial diagnostic modalities, assuming immediate availability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pregnancy-and-marfan-syndrome/abstract/22,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">22,23</a>]. MR imaging without gadolinium contrast is preferred, although gadolinium may be appropriate if it enhances the clarity of the diagnosis.

(See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Assessment of risk of aortic dissection/rupture'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with MFS with an aortic root diameter &ge;45 mm, we suggest elective repair prior to conception, although limited supporting data are available and there is a risk of aortic dissection in the remaining aorta during subsequent pregnancies. (See <a href=\"#H21872254\" class=\"local\">'Elective repair prior to conception'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>All Pregnant women with MFS require regular cardiovascular follow-up during pregnancy with the frequency of follow-up and imaging individualized. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Monitoring'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beta blocker, preferably <a href=\"topic.htm?path=labetalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">labetalol</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoprolol</a>, should be used throughout pregnancy in an attempt to minimize aortic dilatation and the risk of aortic dissection in all MFS patients. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Medical therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Strict blood pressure control is recommended for all pregnant women with MFS. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Medical therapy'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The method of delivery should be carefully considered and individualized for women with MFS by a multidisciplinary care team. Ideally, all MFS patients should deliver at a center that has emergency cardiac surgery services. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Delivery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For Type A (ascending aorta) dissection during the first or second trimester, urgent surgical repair with fetal monitoring when feasible is preferred. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Aortic dissection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For Type A dissection during the third trimester, urgent cesarean delivery followed by aortic repair is suggested. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Aortic dissection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intervention for Type B aortic dissection is occasionally needed during pregnancy; nonsurgical methods may be the safest approach for mother and fetus, but the decision regarding approach should be individualized.
