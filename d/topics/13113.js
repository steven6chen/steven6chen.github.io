This disruption of the protective covering allows blood to come in contact with the highly thrombogenic contents of the necrotic core (in cases of plaque rupture) or collagen of the plaque, which promotes the formation of luminal thrombus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Intraluminal thrombosis after exposure of the blood to calcified nodules has also been observed. Acute coronary syndrome can also result from other mechanisms such as a supply-demand mismatch (so called type 2 myocardial infarction).</p><p>Autopsy studies have shown that when intraluminal thrombi are identified in patients with sudden cardiac death and acute myocardial infarction, the underlying pathology is rupture 55 to 75 percent of the time, erosion 25 to 40 percent of the time, and 2 to 7 percent for calcified nodules [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/1,3-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3-10</a>].

To understand plaque rupture, it is useful to review the stages of development of a plaque [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13450294\"><span class=\"h2\">Intimal thickening and intimal xanthoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pre-existing lesions of adaptive intimal thickening (flow-related intimal thickening is observed at branch points soon after birth) and intimal xanthoma (&ldquo;fatty streaks&rdquo;) are the earliest manifestations of atherosclerotic disease. While some plaques may begin as fatty-streaks, considerable evidence suggests that the intimal thickening is the likely precursor to symptomatic atherosclerotic disease since these lesions occur in children at similar locations as advanced plaques in adults, while fatty streaks are known to regress [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Histologically, intimal thickening consists mainly of smooth muscle cells and proteoglycan-collagen matrix with little or no infiltrating inflammatory cells. Fatty streaks, which are predominantly observed at branch points, correspond to the accumulation of macrophages within the intima and regress with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13450301\"><span class=\"h2\">Pathologic intimal thickening</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The stage between intimal <span class=\"nowrap\">thickening/initial</span> xanthoma and more advanced plaques called fibroatheromas is pathologic intimal thickening and is characterized by extracellular lipid pools containing proteoglycans in the absence of necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/1,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,15</a>]. The lipid pools consist of areas rich in hyaluronan and proteoglycans with absence of smooth muscle cells and inflammatory cells. The lipid pools tend to develop in the deeper intimal layers near the arterial media. When present, macrophage and T lymphocytic infiltrates are near the luminal surface and restricted from the area of accumulated lipid. Early calcification is frequently observed within the areas of lipid pools and likely results from the death of smooth muscle cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Pathologic intimal thickening along with fibroatheromas can be considered a prelude to plaque erosion, which is the second most common culprit lesion morphology in acute coronary syndromes. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13450309\"><span class=\"h2\">Fibrous cap atheroma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first of the advanced coronary lesions is the fibrous cap atheroma (ie, fibroatheroma) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/1,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,17</a>]. This lesion is characterized by a lipid-rich necrotic core encapsulated by fibrous tissue. The earliest phase is characterized by necrosis with macrophage infiltration in the area of a lipid pool, together with the focal loss of proteoglycans or collagen; the accumulation of free cholesterol is not readily apparent in the early stages of fibroatheroma. In late fibroatheromas, discrete collections of cellular debris, increased free cholesterol, and near complete depletion of extracellular matrix are observed. The fibrous cap atheroma may develop into a lesion with a significant luminal stenosis after episodes of hemorrhage with or without calcification and surface disruption.<strong> </strong></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13450322\"><span class=\"h2\">Thin-cap fibroatheroma (vulnerable plaque)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The thin<strong>-</strong>cap fibroatheroma, also referred to as a vulnerable plaque, is identified by a large necrotic core (representing approximately 25 percent of plaque area) separated from the lumen by a thin fibrous cap, less than 65 micrometers in thickness. The fibrous cap is heavily infiltrated by macrophages and to a lesser extent T-lymphocytes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F52661\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef52661 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Typically, the fibrous cap exhibits a paucity or absence of smooth muscle cells. Because it resembles plaques that have ruptured in its morphological appearance (minus the cap discontinuity), this well-characterized lesion is considered a prelude to plaque rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/1,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,18</a>]. It must be acknowledged that cause-and-effect data are missing from this paradigm because we have not been able to detect vulnerable plaque in humans in vivo that eventually rupture consistently and because animal models of plaque rupture are, for the most part, lacking.</p><p>Despite morphologic similarities to lesions that have ruptured (see <a href=\"#H13450329\" class=\"local\">'Plaque rupture'</a> below), thin-cap fibroatheromas exhibit a trend toward smaller necrotic cores, fewer cap macrophages, and less calcification as compared to rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Cross-sectional luminal narrowing in thin-cap fibroatheromas is typically less as compared to underlying stenosis in acute ruptures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The vast majority of thin-cap fibroatheromas (over 80 percent) in sudden coronary death victims have &lt;75 percent cross-sectional luminal-narrowing (or &lt;50 percent diameter stenosis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H174918727\"><span class=\"h3\">Reconsideration of the definition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The fibrous cap thickness of &lt;65 &micro;m is a widely accepted definition of thin-fibrous cap. This definition is based on the postmortem studies of plaque ruptures, which showed that the thickness of the fibrous cap near the rupture site was 23 &plusmn; 19 &micro;m, with 95 percent of the cap measuring less than 64 &micro;m [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, given that tissue fixation and processing result in an approximately 25 to 40 percent shrinkage in arterial wall area in human coronary arteries with moderate to severe atherosclerosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>], it may not be an appropriate cut-off value for the evaluation of rupture-prone plaques in vivo. In fact, optical coherence tomography (OCT) studies evaluating patients with plaque ruptures have demonstrated that the disrupted fibrous cap thickness &lt;70 &micro;m was observed only in 67 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], and median (interquartile range) value of cap thickness was 54 (50 to 60) microm, with 95 percent of the thinnest cap thickness measuring less than 80 &micro;m [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intravascular-ultrasound-optical-coherence-tomography-and-angioscopy-of-coronary-circulation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intravascular ultrasound, optical coherence tomography, and angioscopy of coronary circulation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intravascular-ultrasound-optical-coherence-tomography-and-angioscopy-of-coronary-circulation#H321552326\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intravascular ultrasound, optical coherence tomography, and angioscopy of coronary circulation&quot;, section on 'Optical coherence tomography'</a>.)</p><p>Although the existence of thin-cap fibroatheromas does not necessarily imply that plaque rupture is imminent, further prospective studies together with these OCT findings should address the appropriate definition of thin-fibrous cap thickness in vivo. Importantly, it is essential to define the critical precursors essential for the development of lesion instability to help identify patients at the highest risk of rupture and future coronary events.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13450329\"><span class=\"h2\">Plaque rupture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Morphologically, a plaque that has ruptured shows an intraluminal thrombus overlying a thin disrupted fibrous cap, which is infiltrated by macrophages and T-lymphocytes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. The thrombus is in contact with an underlying necrotic core (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F61067\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61067 \">picture 2</a>). The fibrous cap consists mainly of type I collagen with varying degrees of macrophages and lymphocytes, whereas the smooth muscle cell component within the cap is absent or sparse. In lesions that have ruptured, the mean thickness of the fibrous cap is 23 &plusmn; 19 &mu;m, with 95 percent of the cap measuring less than 65 microm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Although it has been widely accepted that fibrous cap rupture occurs at its weakest point, often near shoulder regions, autopsy studies using serially cut sections demonstrate an equal number of ruptures occurring at the midportion of the fibrous cap [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>Disruption of part of the fibrous cap allows circulating cellular and noncellular elements of the blood to come in direct contact with the highly thrombogenic components of the necrotic core, including tissue factor. Historically, the necrotic core was thought to be the principle source of the tissue factor, an important stimulus for platelet activation. However, it is now believed that circulating monocytes, instead of macrophages within the lesions, can also furnish tissue factor that can trigger and propagate thrombus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Leukocytes and platelets interact via CD15 (a leukocyte membrane-bound carbohydrate known as sialyl Lewis<sup>x</sup>) with P-selectin, which is an &alpha; granule-derived activation-dependent adhesion molecule found on platelets [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. &#160; &#160;</p><p>At the rupture site, the luminal thrombus often is platelet-rich, thereby giving rise to a grossly white appearance (white thrombus), while at the proximal and distal ends near the sites of propagation of the thrombosis it appears red (red thrombus), as it is composed of layers of fibrin and red blood cells.<strong> </strong>Over time, thrombus healing is characterized by an infiltration of smooth muscle cells, accumulated extracellular matrix proteins (ie, proteoglycans and collagen), neovascularization, inflammation, and luminal surface reendothelialization. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13450341\"><span class=\"h2\">Plaque erosion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Plaque erosion represents the second most common lesion associated with acute thrombosis in the coronary circulation. Erosions differ from rupture lesions, as there is an absence of fibrous cap disruption. The primary characteristics of plaque erosion include an abundance of smooth muscle cells and proteoglycan matrix and absence of surface endothelium without a prominent lipid core [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. There is no communication between necrotic core and the lumen. There are generally few macrophages and T-lymphocytes close to the lumen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>The underlying lesion morphology also differs from rupture since it involves early lesions such as pathologic intimal thickening or fibroatheromas without an extensive necrotic core, hemorrhage, or calcification. There is no communication between necrotic core and the lumen. There is usually a smooth muscle cell rich region close to the lumen that separates the thrombus from the underlying necrotic core or lipid pool. An absence of endothelium, secondary to apoptotic loss of endothelial cells, allows flowing blood to come in contact with collagen that leads to thrombus formation. </p><p>It is not well understood why some lesions rupture and others erode.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13450348\"><span class=\"h2\">Calcified nodule</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The calcified nodule is the lesion least frequently associated with luminal thrombus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This term is reserved for fibrocalcific plaques with eruptive, dense, calcific nodules that disrupt the luminal surface and usually protrudes into the lumen. Little or no underlying necrotic core is seen. Heavily calcified arteries often show large plates of calcified matrix with surrounding areas of fibrosis, inflammation, and neovascularization. Although the precise nature of this lesion remains incompletely understood, fragmentation of the calcified plates is believed to represent the etiology of the nodular calcification where even sometimes bone formation can be observed with interspersed fibrin. These lesions are generally more prevalent in older individuals with tortuous and heavily coronary calcified arteries. The calcified nodule erodes into the lumen, allowing the calcium to come in direct contact with flowing blood, inducing thrombus formation.</p><p>Additional clinical correlates of calcified nodules in patients with prior acute coronary syndromes are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-role-of-the-vulnerable-plaque-in-acute-coronary-syndromes#H13452804\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The role of the vulnerable plaque in acute coronary syndromes&quot;, section on 'Calcified nodule'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13450356\"><span class=\"h2\">Healed rupture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Healed lesions occur at sites of prior rupture with thrombus formation, which may or may not be associated with symptoms. They are defined as a third category of atherosclerotic plaques, the other two being non-progressive and progression prone plaques.</p><p>Ruptured lesions with healed repair sites are designated as the healed plaque ruptures. They are identified on the basis of a disrupted fibrous cap with an overlying repair reaction consisting of smooth muscle cells surrounded by proteoglycans <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a collagen-rich matrix, depending on the phase of healing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].<strong> </strong>The matrix within the healed fibrous cap generally begins as an early proteoglycan-rich mass along with type III collagen, which eventually progresses into a type I collagen-rich lesion from organization of the thrombus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F63329\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63329 \">picture 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Healed ruptures frequently exhibit multiple layers of necrotic cores interspersed by fibrous tissue (so-called buried caps), with the earliest of rupture sites located in deeper intima suggestive of previous thrombotic events, which sequentially lead to lesion progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Primarily based on autopsy findings from sudden coronary deaths, healed ruptures contribute to a significant increase in plaque burden and luminal narrowing. They generally occur in the absence of cardiac symptoms. First-time ruptures that precipitate sudden cardiac death are responsible for only 11 percent of acute thrombi [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. </p><p>In plaques with less than 20 percent diameter stenosis, the incidence of healed plaque rupture is 16 percent; in lesions with 21 to 50 percent stenosis, the incidence is 19 percent; and in plaques with greater than 50 percent narrowing, the incidence is 73 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13450371\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISMS OF PLAQUE PROGRESSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The section above describes the pathologic changes that occur in the arterial wall at the site of plaque formation.

The presence of intimal lipoproteins and their derived or modified products causes an increase in the expression of adhesion molecules on the endothelial surface. Adhesion of inflammatory cells involves the expression of selectins, which facilitate the firm attachment of monocytes to endothelial integrins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. </p><p>It is believed that oxidation of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) is a requirement for the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis and is promoted by macrophages, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. LDL oxidation has been shown to occur as a result of lipoxygenases, hypochlorous acid produced by myeloperoxidase, nitric oxide produced by inducible nitric oxide synthase, and superoxide anion produced by NADPH oxidase [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. Such reactive oxygen species derive from macrophages, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells. Oxidized LDL promotes chemoattraction, for example, by inducing the secretion of macrophage-chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) by endothelial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>]. Moreover, macrophages express several scavenger receptors, which can bind a broad spectrum of ligands, including modified lipoproteins, native lipoproteins, and anionic phospholipids, many of which facilitate the massive accumulation of intracellular cholesterol esters and free cholesterol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. </p><p>Macrophages and endothelial cells also express Toll-like receptors (TLRs) on their cell surface, and contain various adaptor molecules (in particular MyD88) that participate in transmembrane signaling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. TLRs activate the proinflammatory transcription factor nuclear factor kappa-B (NF-&kappa;B), resulting in the production of cytokines that augment local inflammation and smooth muscle cell proliferation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. In vitro studies have shown that basal expression of TLR-4 by macrophages is upregulated by oxidized LDL [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>], and that uptake of oxidized lipids into macrophages is facilitated by a <span class=\"nowrap\">CD36/TLR4/TLR6</span> heterotrimer that initiates TLR4 signaling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

Foam cells contain cholesterol esters and free cholesterol.

Macrophages initially accumulate mostly cholesterol esters, but macrophages in advanced lesions contain large amounts of free cholesterol.

Extensive in vivo investigations suggest that the efficiency of phagocytic clearance of apoptotic cells may be supportive in early lesions with minimal effect on lesion cellularity, whereas for late lesions, macrophages may exhibit a defective phagocytic clearance, where remnants of dead cells can lead to activation of proinflammatory responses and subsequent necrotic core expansion and lesion progression (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F79961\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79961 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. Murine studies have identified important effector molecules on macrophages such as tyrosine-kinase defective Mertk receptors or transglutaminase-2 (TG2) that may play a role in the defective clearance of apoptotic cells in atherosclerotic plaques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13450408\"><span class=\"h2\">Intraplaque hemorrhage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Intraplaque hemorrhage is another important contributing factor to the enlargement of necrotic core. Although apoptotic macrophages may be a source of free cholesterol in the development and expansion of the necrotic core, it is unlikely that the total free cholesterol in plaques derive from foam cells alone, since a large part of the cholesterol in foam cells is esterified. Some of the cholesterol crystals in lesions are derived from red cells, as they are frequently observed at sites of hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. Also, the cholesterol content of erythrocyte membrane is the richest in free cholesterol of all cells in the body. Hemorrhage into the necrotic core is a common event and therefore it is likely that the free cholesterol in the necrotic cores also comes from red cell membranes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F79961\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79961 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F58344\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58344 \">picture 4</a>). </p><p>The source of hemorrhage is probably mainly from leaky vasa vasorum that infiltrate the plaque from the adventitia in response to a hypoxic environment created by increased lesion burden and inflammatory macrophages. The vasa vasorum within plaques typically lack an intact basement membrane, are poorly stabilized by surrounding pericytes, and exhibit poor endothelial junctions, which is likely responsible for their acquired lack of integrity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p>In areas of plaque hemorrhage, red blood cell lysis leads to the release of free hemoglobin. Uptake of hemoglobin:haptoglobin complexes via the scavenger receptor CD163 expressed on macrophages allows for the differentiation of these cells into a unique nonfoam cell phenotype characterized by lack of lipid retention and lowered expression of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF&alpha;. These cells play an important role in detoxification of hemoglobin-derived iron and therefore have been suggested to be atheroprotective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/54,55\" class=\"abstract_t\">54,55</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H168035608\"><span class=\"h2\">Coronary arterial remodeling</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An increase in lesion burden compromises lumen size only when 40 percent or greater cross-sectional luminal narrowing is observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. The absence of luminal loss independent of lesion burden in early plaques has been linked to compensatory enlargement of the vessel, ie, positive coronary arterial remodeling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>]. </p><p>Postmortem and intravascular ultrasound studies have revealed that positive remodeling of the coronary arterial wall is associated with a higher lipid content and macrophage infiltration, as well as unstable plaque features such as acute rupture, intraplaque hemorrhage, and thin-cap fibroatheromas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59</a>]. Conversely, lesions of erosion or chronic total occlusion exhibit negative remodeling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. Thus, arterial remodeling may represent one important surrogate for the detection of lesion vulnerability and thrombus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13450422\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISMS OF PLAQUE RUPTURE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although the precise mechanism(s) of plaque rupture is poorly understood, it is widely accepted that disruption occurs at the site of the fibrous cap, which is heavily infiltrated by macrophages and T-lymphocytes where the underlying necrotic core is typically large [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/1,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,30</a>]. While necrotic core expansion and positive remodeling may be associated with plaque progression and lesion vulnerability, the actual degradation of fibrous cap is thought to occur through the breakdown of extracellular matrix proteins by secreted matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). This, together with other critical factors such as apoptosis and local rheological forces including vasospasm, has been implicated in the development of plaque rupture.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13450437\"><span class=\"h2\">Collagen synthesis and breakdown in the fibrous cap</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Vascular smooth muscle cells synthesize essential extracellular matrix proteins such as collagen and elastin from amino acids. Fibrillar collagens, especially type I collagen, provide most of the tensile strength to the fibrous cap. The process of collagen synthesis may be inhibited by interferon gamma (INF-&gamma;) secreted by activated T-cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F65967\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65967 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. Moreover, T-cell activation leads to the expression of CD40 ligands <span class=\"nowrap\">(CD40L/CD154),</span> which bind to CD40 receptors on the macrophages, B-lymphocytes, and other cells including endothelial and smooth muscle cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/30,61-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,61-63</a>]. The expression of CD40L on T-cells promotes tissue proteolysis through the release of MMPs.</p><p>The loss of fibrillar collagen by activated MMPs is thought to be responsible for fibrous cap thinning and therefore may play a pivotal role in the development of plaque rupture (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F65967\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65967 \">figure 3</a>). The initial proteolytic nick in the collagen chain is provided by collagenases MMPs-1, -8, and -13, while the gelatinases MMP-2 and -9 support further breakdown of collagen fragments [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/30,64-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,64-67</a>]. On the other hand, the artery also possesses endogenous antagonists to MMPs, the tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. Atheromatous plaques exhibit cleavage of type I collagen at the sites that are rich in macrophages expressing both MMP-1 and -13 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Other proteinases capable of degrading extracellular matrix include the cathepsin family (cathepsins S and K) and the inhibitor cystatin C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. Unlike collagen breakdown by MMPs, elastolytic activity has been implicated more with matrix remodeling and migration and proliferation of cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. While elastolysis may be more important in aneurysm formation, collagenolysis may be a major determinant of plaque rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13450444\"><span class=\"h2\">Apoptosis and plaque rupture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Apoptosis may also play a critical role in the development of plaque rupture [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. Macrophage and smooth muscle cell apoptosis have been observed in both progression and regression of the atherosclerotic plaque [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. Plaque rupture sites typically show fewer or an absence of smooth muscle cells, which are the principal cells required for the synthesis of extracellular matrix proteins and maintenance of the fibrous cap. In vitro studies have shown that various mediators secreted by macrophages and T-lymphocytes including IFN-&gamma;, Fas ligand, tumor necrosis factor-&alpha; (TNF-&alpha;), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and reactive oxygen species (ROS) can promote smooth muscle cell apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>], which may account for the decrease in smooth muscle cells seen in thin cap fibroatheroma and ruptured plaques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. </p><p>Although macrophage apoptosis is frequently observed at the sites of plaque rupture, it remains unknown whether apoptosis alone is capable of triggering the primary event [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>]. In vitro studies have identified potent mediators, such as oxidized LDL, as capable of inducing macrophage apoptosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. INF-&gamma; has been shown to induce apoptotic cell death of THP-1 macrophages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>], while it also leads to further synthesis of macrophage chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), which may promote additional inflammatory responses. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13450451\"><span class=\"h2\">Local mechanical stress and plaque rupture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although tissue proteolysis and apoptosis within the fibrous cap are believed to be important in the development of plaque rupture, the event may also reflect an effect of local factors related to blood flow dynamics and vasospasm. </p><p>A number of biomechanical and imaging studies have emerged since the 1990s addressing the role of hemodynamic shear stress in the destabilization of vulnerable plaques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/75-77\" class=\"abstract_t\">75-77</a>]. The underlying premise is based on the observation that atherosclerosis develops focally, where rupture occurs more frequently proximal to regions of severe stenosis near flow dividers, an area where circumferential wall stress is assumed to be the highest. Consistent with these observations, blood flow-induced shear stress may also represent a significant influence on processes that govern fibrous cap morphology and composition [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>], where increased peak circumferential stress is greater in thinner fibrous caps [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. Regions with high shear stress typically exhibit high strain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>], thus supporting the notion that mechanical stress, when applied to the weakened fibrous cap, may precipitate rupture, particularly in the presence of microcalcification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H237640\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISMS OF EROSION AND PROGRESSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk factors for erosion are poorly understood and are different from those for rupture. Consistently, plaque erosion is associated with smoking and is predominantly seen in premenopausal women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/7,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,24</a>]. It has been speculated that coronary vasospasm might be involved in the pathophysiology of erosion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. Data from patients suffering from coronary artery spasm demonstrated by optical coherence tomography imaging that erosion lesions occurred in more than one-fourth of patients with many of these containing thrombus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. These data suggest the intriguing possibility that coronary spasm may play a role in the pathogenesis of plaque erosion, though further work is needed to substantiate this concept.</p><p>The <span class=\"nowrap\">plaque/thrombus</span> interface in erosion is unique, consisting of proteoglycans (specifically versican) and hyaluronan; there are often aberrant smooth muscle cells with few or no inflammatory cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/24,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,27</a>]. The lack of a significant inflammatory response raises the possibility that erosions represent chronic wounding and tissue repair rather than a direct atherogenic process.</p><p>Postmortem studies have shown that coronary thrombi superimposed on eroded plaques contain a higher density of myeloperoxidase-positive cells than thrombi superimposed on ruptured plaques [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. Systemic myeloperoxidase levels are also elevated in patients with acute coronary syndromes presenting with eroded plaques as compared to those presenting with rupture, suggesting that elevations in selective inflammatory biomarkers may reflect specific acute coronary events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. It is hypothesized that a selective accumulation of hyaluronan and proteoglycans in eroded plaques may promote deendothelialization and platelet thrombus formation along with accumulation of circulating neutrophils and monocyte-expressing myeloperoxidase, which may further lead to endothelial cell death and thus promote thrombus formation. In sudden coronary death victims, 85 percent of erosive thrombi show organizing lesions, whereas in plaque rupture, only 50 percent of thrombi show organization, and we believe that organization of the thrombus plays an important role in progression of the plaque area [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathology-and-pathogenesis-of-the-vulnerable-plaque/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2881808245\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most coronary syndromes result from the loss of integrity of the protective covering over an atherosclerotic plaque. This occurs with plaque rupture, plaque erosion, or calcified nodule. The loss of the protective endothelial covering allows blood to come in contact with the highly thrombogenic contents of collagen <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> necrotic core of the plaque and allows luminal thrombosis to occur. Other mechanisms can cause acute coronary syndromes, including a supply-demand mismatch.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The precursor lesion of plaque rupture has been designated as thin-cap fibroatheroma, which is a descriptive term that was traditionally called a vulnerable plaque.
