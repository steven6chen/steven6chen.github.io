Perhaps the most important and far-reaching document on what to include in an asthma education program has been &quot;the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program: Expert Panel Report 3, Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Asthma -- Full Report 2007&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/what-do-patients-need-to-know-about-their-asthma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

Based on a series of focus group interviews, the &quot;core elements&quot; necessary in an asthma education program have been identified [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/what-do-patients-need-to-know-about-their-asthma/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. The <strong>three topics</strong> of primary importance for patient education are the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Function and appropriate use of medication</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pathophysiology of asthma</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Issues in the prevention and treatment of symptoms</p><p/><p>The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP) has emphasized that clinician care is necessary, but not sufficient to achieve asthma control.

Conflicting evidence has been reported about whether action plans have a meaningful benefit in the management of asthma. A systematic review and meta-analysis did not find evidence that action plans reduce exacerbations or improve quality of life or lung function for adults with asthma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/what-do-patients-need-to-know-about-their-asthma/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. However, the evidence was felt to be of low quality and many asthma specialists, including ourselves, believe that action plans are useful in clarifying the medication plan and providing guidance for adjusting treatment in response to changes in asthma symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/what-do-patients-need-to-know-about-their-asthma/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Thus, action plans should include directions about daily self-assessment and baseline medications, as well as a plan for managing exacerbations, including peak expiratory flow (PEF) levels and symptoms for which acute care is needed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F55900\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef55900 \">form 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F71958\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef71958 \">form 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F56621\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef56621 \">algorithm 1</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/what-do-patients-need-to-know-about-their-asthma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

During a patient's first visit, information regarding medications, treatment goals, how following the plan will help the patient reach these goals, and when to seek urgent care can be incorporated into the plan. </p><p>For those patients who have or will be provided with a peak flow meter, the concepts of personal best peak flow rate and how this measurement is used should be discussed. The patient should receive a chart to record peak flow rates. At a subsequent visit, the patient's personal best peak flow can be added to the plan. Specific instructions for creating an individualized asthma action plan, as well as the needed charts for recording peak flows, are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=peak-expiratory-flow-rate-monitoring-in-asthma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Peak expiratory flow rate monitoring in asthma&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The plan should be reviewed and refined at subsequent follow-up visits. Emphasizing the patient's personal goals is essential to enhancing adherence. For example, ask, &quot;Have you had any problems taking your bronchodilator immediately before playing basketball? Has it helped you stay in the game?&quot;. Question the patient about any aspects of the plan that were confusing or unhelpful.</p><p>A written action plan is especially important for patients with moderate-to-severe persistent asthma and patients with a history of severe exacerbations.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Daily asthma care</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients may monitor the status of their asthma based upon symptoms alone, or by additionally monitoring daily peak flow readings.

By using an instrument like this, busy clinicians can identify the most important points to discuss with each patient. The National Asthma Education and Prevention Program Expert Panel also has developed a strategy for building self-management education into patient care visits. This plan is provided in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F56749%7EPULM%2F63828%7EPULM%2F75688%7EPULM%2F64430\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef56749 graphicRef63828 graphicRef75688 graphicRef64430 \">table 7A-D</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/what-do-patients-need-to-know-about-their-asthma/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1927156256\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials.

A comprehensive list of asthma education topics outlined by the National Asthma Education and Prevention Program is provided in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F61244\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61244 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The three characteristics of asthma for patients and families to understand are that airways inflammation, sensitivity to triggers, and the temporary occurrence of airflow obstruction leading to shortness of breath are all components of asthma. Understanding these characteristics provides the foundation for an understanding of asthma medications and trigger avoidance. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'What is asthma?'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An &quot;asthma action plan&quot; is developed based on the collaboration between the patient (and family) and asthma care provider and includes information and guidance on routine daily care and management of exacerbations. Examples of action plans are provided in the figures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F55900\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef55900 \">form 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F71958\" class=\"graphic graphic_form graphicRef71958 \">form 2</a>). A school asthma action plan is also useful (<a href=\"http://www.aafa.org/pdfs/2010StudentAsthmaActionCard.pdf&amp;token=Zhk3SsDNzGEOSDTcBVv9ffWZwwnow4OjM3m6c8YX2p9ze29/geDLsPEaTE7OBj4PKS0pJJgA+M7WEjqFZ5sLbw==&amp;TOPIC_ID=4001\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">student asthma action plan</a>). A written action plan is especially important for patients with moderate-to-severe<strong> </strong>persistent asthma and patients with a history of severe exacerbations. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Asthma action plans'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inhaled medications are a key component of asthma management and correct inhaler use is essential. Patients and their families need clear instructions and demonstration of the correct use of each type of inhaler and spacer or chamber device prescribed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F72731\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72731 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F58957\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef58957 \">picture 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F57922\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef57922 \">picture 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F51020%7EPI%2F109205\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51020 graphicRef109205 \">table 5A-B</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F58951\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58951 \">table 8</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F103302\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103302 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F103303\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103303 \">table 4</a>).
