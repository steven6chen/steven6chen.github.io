It is caused by a type of bacteria called Campylobacter.</p><p>Campylobacter bacteria are often found in chicken, turkey, and other types of poultry. These bacteria are also found in other types of meat. Most often, people get infected with campylobacter when they:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eat undercooked chicken or other meats</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eat foods that were prepared using knives, cutting boards, or other kitchen tools that were used on raw chicken or meat and were not washed</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drink milk that is not pasteurized or eat foods made with milk that is not pasteurized</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7929167\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a Campylobacter infection?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diarrhea that comes on suddenly (and can be bloody)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stomach cramps</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain in the area around the belly button (sometimes spreading to the right side of the belly)</p><p/><p>For about a day before the above symptoms start, a third of those with a Campylobacter infection also get:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High fever</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shaking</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Body aches</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dizziness</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Confusion</p><p/><p>Diarrhea caused by Campylobacter usually lasts about a week and then goes away on its own. Belly pain sometimes continues even after diarrhea goes away.</p><p>In very few cases, some people develop pain in their ankles, knees, or other joints after having a Campylobacter infection. This pain usually goes away on its own. In very rare cases, some people develop a different problem called Guillain-Barre syndrome after having a Campylobacter infection. In Guillain-Barre syndrome, a person's infection-fighting system attacks his or her own nervous system. This can cause muscle weakness on both sides of the body.</p><p>In children, the symptoms of Campylobacter infection can be more severe. Children can have the same symptoms listed above, but they can also have vomiting and a higher fever. In children, the fever can even lead to seizures.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7929182\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>See your doctor or nurse if you:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have severe belly pain</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cannot eat or drink</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vomit blood or have blood in your bowel movements</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have a fever higher than 100.4&deg;F (38&deg;C)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have diarrhea that lasts more than a week</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have any medical problem that makes it hard for you to fight infection (such as cancer or AIDS) or you take medicines to suppress your immune system</p><p/><p>Young children and older adults with symptoms should make sure to see their doctor or nurse. That's because people in these groups can get dehydrated more easily.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7929197\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Probably not, but your doctor might do a test on a sample of bowel movement to check what type of infection you have.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7929212\"><span class=\"h1\">How is Campylobacter infection treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Treatment is not usually needed. Most people get better without treatment.</p><p>People who are very sick or who do not get better after a week can get antibiotics to fight the infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7929227\"><span class=\"h1\">Is there anything I can do on my own to feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. You can:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drink enough liquids so that your body does not get &quot;dehydrated.&quot; Dehydration is when the body loses too much water.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eat small meals that do not have a lot of fat in them</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rest, if you feel tired</p><p/><p><strong>Can Campylobacter infection be prevented?</strong> &mdash; To reduce your chance of getting (or spreading) a Campylobacter infection and other types of food poisoning:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wash your hands after changing diapers, going to the bathroom, blowing your nose, touching animals, or taking out the trash</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stay home from work or school until you feel better (if you are sick)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pay attention to food safety.

If you are pregnant or have trouble fighting off infections, talk to your doctor or nurse about other ways to prevent getting food poisoning.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7929259\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-poisoning-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Food poisoning (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diarrhea-in-adolescents-and-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Diarrhea in adolescents and adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=diarrhea-in-children-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Diarrhea in children (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nausea-and-vomiting-in-adults-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Nausea and vomiting in adults (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=viral-gastroenteritis-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Viral gastroenteritis (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=rotavirus-infection-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Rotavirus infection (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=enteric-typhoid-fever-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Enteric (typhoid) fever (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=food-poisoning-foodborne-illness-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Food poisoning (foodborne illness) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-diarrhea-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Acute diarrhea in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-diarrhea-in-children-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Acute diarrhea in children (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-diarrhea-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Chronic diarrhea in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 02, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
