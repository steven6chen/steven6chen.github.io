The most frequent causes are the factor V Leiden (FVL) mutation and the prothrombin gene mutation (PGM), which together account for 50 to 60 percent of cases of an inherited (primary) hypercoagulable state in Caucasian populations. Defects in protein S, protein C, and antithrombin (AT) account for most of the remaining cases. Each of these disorders is discussed separately, as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>FVL mutation &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=factor-v-leiden-and-activated-protein-c-resistance\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Factor V Leiden and activated protein C resistance&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prothrombin G20210A gene mutation (PGM) &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prothrombin-g20210a-mutation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prothrombin G20210A mutation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Protein S deficiency &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=protein-s-deficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Protein S deficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Protein C deficiency &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=protein-c-deficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Protein C deficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>AT deficiency &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antithrombin-deficiency\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antithrombin deficiency&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Although collectively prevalent in approximately 10 percent of Caucasian populations, these disorders appear to be responsible, at least in part, for up to half of maternal venous thromboembolism (VTE) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-thrombophilias-in-pregnancy/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Homozygosity for MTHFR polymorphisms (C677T, 1298C) is a relatively common cause of mildly elevated plasma homocysteine levels, but these mutations do not appear to increase the risk of VTE in pregnant or nonpregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-thrombophilias-in-pregnancy/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].

Screening for these thrombophilias is not indicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-thrombophilias-in-pregnancy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Elevations in the levels of some procoagulant factors other than prothrombin are also risk factors for VTE. For example, elevated factor VIII coagulant activity is a prothrombotic risk factor for a first unprovoked VTE; however, elevated levels are not a risk factor for recurrence and should not be viewed as an inherited thrombophilia. Furthermore, assays for factor VIII levels have not been standardized and there is no information on the interpretation of factor VIII levels in pregnancy with respect to prothrombotic risk.

However, the absolute risk remains low at about 0.1 percent.</p><p>In pregnancy, the risk of VTE is magnified in women who have certain inherited (and acquired) thrombophilias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-thrombophilias-in-pregnancy/abstract/9-13\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-13</a>] and is even higher in those with multiple thrombophilic defects [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-thrombophilias-in-pregnancy/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Data suggest that at least 50 percent of women with VTE during pregnancy have an acquired or inherited thrombophilia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-thrombophilias-in-pregnancy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. All thrombophilias, however, do not confer equivalent degrees of risk for thrombotic complications during pregnancy. </p><p>The occurrence of VTE is also affected by additional risk factors, such as recent surgery, age over 35 years, high parity, obesity, smoking, and immobilization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-thrombophilias-in-pregnancy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The most important determinant of risk is a personal history of VTE or VTE in a first-degree relative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-thrombophilias-in-pregnancy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In the case of FVL, a prior personal or family history of VTE may increase the likelihood of a VTE in pregnancy by 50-fold, from 0.2 percent to 10 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-thrombophilias-in-pregnancy/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

For example:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a prospective study of 4885 low-risk women with first trimester singleton pregnancy and no history of thromboembolism, 134 (2.7 percent) carried the FVL mutation and none had a VTE during pregnancy or up to six weeks postpartum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-thrombophilias-in-pregnancy/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a prospective study of 1707 nulliparous Australian women with no prior history of adverse pregnancy outcome or personal or family history of VTE, the prevalence of heterozygosity for FVL and PGM was 5.39 and 2.38 percent, respectively, and none of the patients developed VTE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-thrombophilias-in-pregnancy/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the Thrombophilia in Pregnancy Prophylaxis Study (TIPPS), 292 pregnant women with thrombophilia at increased risk of VTE or with previous placenta-mediated pregnancy complications were randomly assigned to receive antepartum prophylactic dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dalteparin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dalteparin</a> or no dalteparin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-thrombophilias-in-pregnancy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].

Most prospective studies have not found an association, although retrospective studies suggested a modest link between FVL heterozygosity (and possibly PGM heterozygosity and protein C and S deficiency) and fetal loss after 10 weeks and particularly for nonrecurrent loss after 20 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-thrombophilias-in-pregnancy/abstract/18-21,23-25\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21,23-25</a>]. This suggests that any association is limited to high-risk populations and is modest. Small case-control or retrospective cohort studies involving heterogeneous populations have frequently reported contradictory results, in part because of the influence of various confounders that are often not analyzed appropriately [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-thrombophilias-in-pregnancy/abstract/26,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">26,27</a>].

Nevertheless, we would screen such women for hereditary thrombophilia, particularly if there was a family history of VTE. If a high-risk thrombophilic defect such as antithrombin (AT) deficiency was identified, treatment with higher-intensity prophylactic anticoagulation (eg, more than a single daily dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enoxaparin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">enoxaparin</a> 40 mg subcutaneously) and AT concentrate in the peripartum period would be reasonable.</p><p>Testing is also reasonable in asymptomatic (no prior VTE) women planning a pregnancy who have a first degree relative with a history of a high-risk thrombophilia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-thrombophilias-in-pregnancy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Identification of a heritable thrombophilic defect in the relative can narrow the laboratory evaluation to determine whether or not the woman carries the specific defect. The rationale for such testing is that antepartum and postpartum prophylaxis may be indicated if the asymptomatic patient is found to be a carrier of one of the more highly thrombogenic defects (eg, AT deficiency, double heterozygosity or homozygosity for FVL and PGM). Postpartum thromboprophylaxis may be indicated if the asymptomatic patient is a carrier of one of the less thrombogenic defects (eg, heterozygous FVL) in the presence of other risk factors (eg, cesarean delivery, prolonged immobilization, severe obesity) or has a symptomatic first-degree relative with VTE before age 50 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-thrombophilias-in-pregnancy/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>].

In the United States population, homocysteine levels have come down since folate fortification of flour was mandated; thus, fewer patients with VTE are found to have high homocysteine levels. Furthermore, pregnant women are routinely prescribed multivitamins containing folate to reduce the risk of neural tube defects. In addition, recent data show that high homocysteine levels are a weaker risk factor for VTE or arterial thrombosis than reported in earlier studies (OR 1.2-1.6 versus 2) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-thrombophilias-in-pregnancy/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>], and intervention studies with B vitamin supplementation, albeit in nonpregnant patients, do not show a reduction in arterial or venous thrombotic events [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-thrombophilias-in-pregnancy/abstract/70-72\" class=\"abstract_t\">70-72</a>].

Homozygosity for these genetic variants is a relatively common cause of mildly elevated plasma homocysteine levels in the general population, often occurring in association with serum folate levels in the low normal range. High quality epidemiologic studies (eg, Leiden Thrombophilia Study, Physicians' Health Study) have not found a significant increase in VTE risk among individuals homozygous for MTHFR polymorphisms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inherited-thrombophilias-in-pregnancy/abstract/73-76\" class=\"abstract_t\">73-76</a>].

The latter is associated with a two- to three-fold elevation in PAI-1 levels, and these levels can be even higher in patients with metabolic syndrome and those with the <span class=\"nowrap\">D/D</span> genotype in the ACE gene. In our opinion, the available studies linking these genotypes with preeclampsia and other adverse pregnancy outcomes have many limitations and do not provide any evidence for testing women with adverse pregnancy outcome or using the results of prior testing to influence patient management.
