Such complications may, in turn, result in preterm birth. There is also an increased risk of perinatal mortality. Benefits include that older couples tend to be more emotionally mature and financially stable than when they were younger. Providing information to all patients of child-bearing age about the obstetrical risks of advanced maternal age can help them make informed decisions about the timing of child-bearing.</p><p>This topic will address the management of pregnancy in women of advanced age, which is generally agreed upon as age &ge;35 years.

Historically, AMA was defined as maternal age &ge; 35 years based on the convergence of the risk of fetal Down syndrome and the risk of amniocentesis to assess for Down syndrome. Other studies have defined AMA as age 40 or greater, and a category of &quot;very advanced maternal age&quot; has been proposed for women &ge;45 years or &ge;50 years, depending on the study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pregnancy-in-women-of-advanced-age/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H520445554\"><span class=\"h2\">Very advanced maternal age and implications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women of very advanced maternal age (&gt;45 years of age) have higher complication rates, multiple gestation rates, and an increase in rates of preterm birth and fetal growth restriction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F110512\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110512 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pregnancy-in-women-of-advanced-age/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. A cohort study comparing women 48 years of age and older with those ages 47 or less reported that women &ge;48 years of age had a nearly threefold increase in cesarean delivery, a fourfold increase in gestational diabetes, a sixfold increase in the risk of requiring blood transfusion, and a 33-fold increase in intensive care unit admission, after controlling the data for multiple gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pregnancy-in-women-of-advanced-age/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2760397405\"><span class=\"h1\">INCIDENCE OF BIRTHS TO OLDER WOMEN</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There has been a notable shift to pregnancy at older maternal ages, particularly in resource-rich countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pregnancy-in-women-of-advanced-age/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. As an example, in the United States, the rates of pregnancy have decreased for women under 30 years and increased for women age 30 and above from 1990 to 2015 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F110497\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110497 \">table 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F110511\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110511 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pregnancy-in-women-of-advanced-age/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p>At a time when women are delaying childbearing, the availability of assisted reproductive technologies for older women has allowed women to extend their reproductive options. In the United States, there were 743 births to women ages &ge;50 years in 2014, an increase from 677 births in 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pregnancy-in-women-of-advanced-age/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1235663974\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK OF MISCARRIAGE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of pregnancy loss associated with advancing maternal age has been well recognized. Population-based studies have reported miscarriage rates up to 40 percent in 35- to 44-year-old women and 60 to 65 percent in women ages greater than 45 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pregnancy-in-women-of-advanced-age/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. In addition, the increased risk of pregnancy loss extends beyond the first trimester. In a British study of 76,000 singleton pregnancies with a live fetus, the miscarriage rates after 11 weeks of gestation were 1.2 percent for women under the age of 35, 1.6 percent in women 35 to 39 years of age, and 2.7 percent in women 40 years of age or older (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F110507\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef110507 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pregnancy-in-women-of-advanced-age/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3164031591\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECIFIC PRENATAL CARE ISSUES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to routine prenatal assessments, we discuss the following issues with women of advanced maternal age.

Since type 2 diabetes may not have been recognized peri-conceptionally, screening older obese gravida for gestational diabetes in the first trimester, as well as later in pregnancy, is reasonable.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The risk of fetal aneuploidy based on maternal age should be reviewed (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F70032\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef70032 \">table 2</a>). Most data relate to risk of trisomy 21 or composite risk of any aneuploidy, but some data are also available for maternal age-specific prevalence of trisomies 13 and 18 for women aged 16&ndash;45 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pregnancy-in-women-of-advanced-age/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Testing for fetal aneuploidy can be divided into invasive and non-invasive tests. Invasive testing, which includes amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling, is diagnostic. Non-invasive testing of maternal blood (for either hormone levels or cell-free fetal DNA), with or without ultrasound examination, is a screening test and requires follow-up testing of patients with screen-positive results. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=down-syndrome-overview-of-prenatal-screening\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Down syndrome: Overview of prenatal screening&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnostic-amniocentesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnostic amniocentesis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chorionic-villus-sampling\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chorionic villus sampling&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sonographic-findings-associated-with-fetal-aneuploidy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sonographic findings associated with fetal aneuploidy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-screening-for-common-aneuploidies-using-cell-free-dna\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prenatal screening for common aneuploidies using cell-free DNA&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In women of advanced maternal age, noninvasive prenatal testing detecting cell-free fetal DNA in maternal blood is becoming the preferred test because it has both higher sensitivity and a lower false-positive rate than <span class=\"nowrap\">analyte/ultrasound</span> screening and it is safer than invasive testing (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F110510\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110510 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pregnancy-in-women-of-advanced-age/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Down syndrome screening tests have both higher detection rates and higher false positive rates in older women than in younger women because of the higher prevalence of Down syndrome in offspring of older women. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prenatal-screening-for-common-aneuploidies-using-cell-free-dna\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prenatal screening for common aneuploidies using cell-free DNA&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Given the increased risk of congenital anomalies in older women, we believe a detailed second trimester ultrasound examination to assess for significant structural anomalies (particularly cardiac defects) is reasonable. The cost-effectiveness of this approach, however, has not been proven. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=effects-of-advanced-maternal-age-on-pregnancy#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Effects of advanced maternal age on pregnancy&quot;, section on 'Congenital malformations'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=routine-prenatal-ultrasonography-as-a-screening-tool\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Routine prenatal ultrasonography as a screening tool&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Events that occur with increased frequency in older gravidae include hypertensive disease and preeclampsia, placenta previa, gestational diabetes, and placental abruption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pregnancy-in-women-of-advanced-age/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. We educate women about these conditions as well as the implications of preterm birth, which can be required in treating some of these complications. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The patient's risk for adverse outcome, including preterm <span class=\"nowrap\">delivery/low</span> birth weight, intrauterine growth restriction, and stillbirth, should be assessed by considering not only her age, but also the presence or absence of concomitant risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, obesity, low socioeconomic status, black race, and previous pregnancy complicated by growth restriction or preterm birth.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1604910637\"><span class=\"h2\">Third trimester</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As there are no large randomized trials that have examined the efficacy of routine antepartum testing in women age 35 and older, there remains no consensus on the management of late pregnancy for these women. One strategy is to stratify women based on their risk factors, such as age and parity, and to consider other factors that might influence risk, such as pregestational obesity and race [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pregnancy-in-women-of-advanced-age/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. </p><p>For pregnant women ages 35 years and older, we obtain an ultrasound examination at 38 to 39 weeks of gestation to assess fetal growth and amniotic fluid volume. We then perform twice-weekly antepartum testing (alternating between a nonstress test and a biophysical profile) and&nbsp;ask women to monitor daily fetal movement (kick counts) until delivery. We emphasize the importance of fetal movement as a sign of fetal well-being and encourage all of our patients to report decreased fetal movement in a timely fashion. If at any point this testing is not reassuring, then additional testing or induction of labor is warranted. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-antepartum-fetal-surveillance\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of antepartum fetal surveillance&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=decreased-fetal-movement-diagnosis-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Decreased fetal movement: Diagnosis, evaluation, and management&quot;</a>.) </p><p>A retrospective cohort study of over 4400 women reported that by following a protocol for pregnant women &ge;35 years that included weekly biophysical profile testing beginning at 36 weeks of gestation and induction of labor by 41 weeks of gestation, the risk of stillbirth &ge;36 weeks gestation was the same among advanced maternal age and non-advanced maternal age women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pregnancy-in-women-of-advanced-age/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. For women who are 35 years of age and older who have additional risk factors, such as primiparity or obesity or who are black, we generally start testing in a way that is convenient for the patient, alternating nonstress tests with ultrasounds weekly at 36 weeks.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1690179516\"><span class=\"h2\">Risks of stillbirth versus delivery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The risk of stillbirth increases with increasing maternal age such that women &ge;40 years of age have the same risk of stillbirth at 39 weeks of gestation as women in their mid-20s have at 41 weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pregnancy-in-women-of-advanced-age/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. In addition to advancing age, parity also impacts the risk of stillbirth, with primiparous women having a greater risk at each gestational age compared with multiparous women. A population-based study including over five million births reported the risk of stillbirth after 37 weeks of gestation in primiparous and multiparous women less than 35 years of age was <span class=\"nowrap\">1/270</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">1/775,</span> respectively; for women 35 to 39 years of age, it was <span class=\"nowrap\">1/156</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">1/502,</span> respectively; and for women 40 years of age or older, it was <span class=\"nowrap\">1/116</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">1/304,</span> respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pregnancy-in-women-of-advanced-age/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. In this study, black women had a higher risk of stillbirth at 37 weeks of gestation or longer at all maternal ages. Black women 40 years or older were the highest risk group, with a 2.45-fold increase in stillbirth risk at 37 weeks or longer compared with white women younger than 35 years of age (lowest risk group). Thus older women at term and their care providers must balance the benefits of remaining pregnant and waiting for spontaneous labor against the risk of stillbirth: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a national cohort study of over 829,000 births from 2000 through 2012, the risk of stillbirth after 37 weeks of gestation fell as the frequency of induction of labor increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pregnancy-in-women-of-advanced-age/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective database review of over 700,000 deliveries between 37 and 43 weeks of gestation in Scotland from the time period of 1985 to 1996 reported the lowest cumulative probability of perinatal death at 38 weeks of gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pregnancy-in-women-of-advanced-age/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A trial comparing labor induction with expectant management in women ages 35 years or older reported no significant difference in the risk of cesarean section or neonatal outcomes, including birth weight &lt;2500 g, Apgar score of 4 to 7, umbilical-cord blood arterial pH &lt;7.00, or neonatal intensive care unit admission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pregnancy-in-women-of-advanced-age/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Of note, the study was not adequately powered to assess the risk of perinatal mortality.</p><p/><p>Based on the above data, we favor delivery in the 39<sup>th</sup> week of gestation for women ages 35 years and older because of the increased risk of stillbirth beyond this gestational age, the diminishing reproductive options for women in this age group, and the low risk of neonatal <span class=\"nowrap\">morbidity/mortality</span> at this gestational age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pregnancy-in-women-of-advanced-age/abstract/18,19,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19,23</a>]. We more strongly favor induction at 39 weeks of gestation for women who are &ge;35 years and primiparous, &ge;39 years of age, of black race, or who have additional risk factors for stillbirth such as obesity. That said, we discuss both the options of induction and ongoing surveillance with these women and respect the patient's preference regarding timing and type of intervention. Women who decline induction are managed with twice-weekly testing and daily kick counts until spontaneous labor, nonreassuring testing, or 41 weeks of gestation (when induction is typically recommended for late-term gestation) is achieved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pregnancy-in-women-of-advanced-age/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

However, the data do not support such increases. In a meta-analysis of four studies including over 2500 women comparing induction of labor versus expectant management at term for women &ge;35 years of age, there was no statistically significant difference in cesarean delivery rates between the induction and expectant management groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pregnancy-in-women-of-advanced-age/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In a trial that randomly assigned over 600 women ages 35 years or older to either induction of labor between 39 weeks 0 days and 39 weeks 6 days of gestation or to expectant management, the cesarean delivery and operative vaginal delivery rates were similar between the two groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pregnancy-in-women-of-advanced-age/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. There were also no differences in the rates of adverse maternal or neonatal outcomes. No maternal or infant deaths occurred in either group. A retrospective cohort study of over 26,000 births reported that, for women of advanced maternal age, delivery between 38<sup><span class=\"nowrap\">5/7ths</span> </sup>weeks and 39<sup><span class=\"nowrap\">6/7ths</span> </sup>weeks optimized the balance among maternal cesarean delivery rate, neonatal intensive care unit admission rate, maternal third- and fourth-degree perineal laceration rates, and newborn Apgar &le;6 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-pregnancy-in-women-of-advanced-age/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2843033684\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
