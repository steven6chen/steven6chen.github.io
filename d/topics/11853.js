Stress testing provides physiologic evidence of clinically significant coronary artery stenoses by demonstrating the effects of diminished coronary flow reserve on symptoms, characteristic changes on the electrocardiogram (ECG), myocardial perfusion defects on scintigraphy, or regional wall motion abnormalities on echocardiography. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stress-testing-for-the-diagnosis-of-obstructive-coronary-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stress testing for the diagnosis of obstructive coronary heart disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Nondiagnostic findings or strong clinical suspicion conflicting with the findings on stress testing may suggest the need for direct (anatomic) assessment of the coronary artery lumen with invasive coronary arteriography. However, catheter-based angiography is expensive and is associated with a small risk of serious complications that are directly related to its invasive nature and to the use of iodinated contrast media (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-diagnostic-cardiac-catheterization\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of diagnostic cardiac catheterization&quot;</a>). In addition, up to 50 percent or more of patients referred for an elective coronary angiogram are found to not have significant CAD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-coronary-imaging-with-cardiac-computed-tomography-and-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. </p><p>Improving safety and cost effectiveness provided most of the rationale for the development of noninvasive methods of coronary angiography. Noninvasive visualization of coronary arteries is rendered difficult by their small caliber, tortuous course, and almost constant motion. Thus, potential imaging modalities must possess high temporal and spatial resolution.</p><p>Noninvasive coronary arteriography was first described for cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) in 1993 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-coronary-imaging-with-cardiac-computed-tomography-and-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>] and for computed tomography (CT) in 1995 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-coronary-imaging-with-cardiac-computed-tomography-and-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The clinical use of these techniques, particularly CT, is becoming widely available and increasingly popular.</p><p>The technical issues associated with and results of studies evaluating the use of CT and CMRI for noninvasive coronary angiography will be reviewed here. Potential indications will also be discussed. The use of CT to detect coronary artery calcification is presented separately.

CCTA procedures are performed with multidetector row scanners (MDCT), sometimes referred to as multislice scanners.</p><p>For CCTA, intravenous iodinated contrast is administered as a bolus, and contrast passage through the coronary arteries is imaged with ECG-triggered acquisitions. Oral or intravenous beta blockers, or both, are administered to slow the heart rate to less than 60 to 70 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/minute</span>. Sublingual <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nitroglycerin-glyceryl-trinitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nitroglycerin</a> is sometimes given immediately before the exam to achieve vasodilation. In some practice settings, contrast passage through the myocardium is acquired subsequently for cardiac perfusion imaging. If such images are to be acquired, a continuous intravenous infusion of adenosine is usually administered. </p><p>The relative test performance of CCTA and cardiovascular magnetic resonance angiography are discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Comparison of CCTA and CMRI'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">MDCT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MDCT scanners use mechanically rotating gantries. Scanners from different manufacturers vary slightly in their technical specifications but all have two features in common: a temporal resolution high enough to allow imaging of the beating heart without motion artifact if the heart rate is regular and slow (usually less than 60 to 70 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/min),</span> and acquisition of more than one image slice per gantry rotation.</p><p>The temporal resolution of an MDCT scanner is defined by its gantry rotation time. MDCT scanners used for CCTA should have a gantry rotation time of less than 420 msec (corresponding to a temporal resolution of less than 210 msec), and should allow a radiograph beam collimation of less than 1 mm.</p><p>MDCT technology is evolving continuously and rapidly. Most MDCT scanners now in use acquire at least 64 rows or slices simultaneously with a collimation of 0.6 mm with a gantry rotation time of 333 msec (corresponding to a temporal resolution of approximately 167 msec) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-coronary-imaging-with-cardiac-computed-tomography-and-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance/abstract/9-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12</a>]. The newest single-source MDCT scanners can acquire 320 slices with each gantry rotation.</p><p>A dual <span class=\"nowrap\">source/dual</span> energy MDCT scanner is also available, which effectively reduces temporal resolution by 50 percent to 83 msec, thereby facilitating imaging without the need for beta blockers in many patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Limitations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following patient-related factors can interfere with the diagnostic quality of CCTA images [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-coronary-imaging-with-cardiac-computed-tomography-and-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance/abstract/10,11,13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11,13-16</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Heart rate greater than 60 or 70 <span class=\"nowrap\">beats/min</span>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Irregular heart rhythm (atrial fibrillation or frequent atrial or ventricular extrasystoles).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Inability to sustain a breath hold for at least five seconds.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe coronary calcification or the presence of coronary artery stents, since image reconstruction artifacts related to radiodense material such as calcium or metal can obscure the coronary artery lumen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-coronary-imaging-with-cardiac-computed-tomography-and-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].

Advantages of CMRI over CCTA include the absence of exposure to ionizing radiation and iodinated contrast media and the lack of necessity for heart rate control with beta blockers. These features facilitate sequential studies and permit imaging in younger patients and those with renal dysfunction.</p><p>In addition, coronary artery calcification, which lowers specificity with CCTA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-coronary-imaging-with-cardiac-computed-tomography-and-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance/abstract/10,11,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11,17</a>], is not prominent on CMRI images because of its low proton content. As a result, detection of coronary lesions in heavily calcified coronary segments by CMRI can be more reliable than by CCTA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-coronary-imaging-with-cardiac-computed-tomography-and-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

An important exception is the presence of a coronary artery stent. Irrespective of stent type and the time since implantation, stents are not a contraindication to MRI. However, the stent will interfere with local image quality. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=general-principles-of-the-use-of-intracoronary-stents#H25\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;General principles of the use of intracoronary stents&quot;, section on 'Safety of MRI'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Irregular heart rhythms, inability to comply with breath-holding instructions (for breath-holding approaches), and an irregular breathing pattern (free breathing approaches) will result in poor image quality.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There is variability for both imaging and respiratory motion suppression among the CMRI sequences from different vendors.

However, stenoses of less than 70 percent are typically not flow-limiting, are rarely the cause of ischemia or angina, and usually do not require revascularization. Thus, the sensitivities reported in the literature may not reflect the ability of CCTA to identify those patients with chest pain who will need catheter-based or surgical revascularization. This problem is reflected in the discrepant diagnostic accuracies of stress testing (functional evaluation) and anatomic imaging with CCTA in studies that compared these two approaches. The degree of luminal narrowing on CCTA has been determined only by visual estimate in most studies to date.</p><p>Many CCTA studies prior to 2000 were performed on electron-beam computed tomography scanners that are no longer in use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-coronary-imaging-with-cardiac-computed-tomography-and-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].

In preliminary studies, differences in plaque morphology and composition were noted between culprit lesions in acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and stable lesions in patients with stable or unstable angina [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-coronary-imaging-with-cardiac-computed-tomography-and-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance/abstract/77-80\" class=\"abstract_t\">77-80</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute coronary syndrome</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CCTA has been studied for use as a triage tool for patients undergoing evaluation for ACS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-coronary-imaging-with-cardiac-computed-tomography-and-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance/abstract/77-79,81-83\" class=\"abstract_t\">77-79,81-83</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In 103 consecutive patients who were admitted to the hospital without ischemic electrocardiograph changes <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> elevated biomarkers, 64-slice MDCT was shown to allow accurate triage.

Nevertheless, the MDCT group required fewer repeat evaluations for chest pain, as compared with standard care, and was associated with lowered costs and reduced time to diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-coronary-imaging-with-cardiac-computed-tomography-and-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Interestingly, differences in plaque morphology and composition that have been noted between patients with stable or unstable angina may support the use of MDCT angiography over coronary calcium scoring to exclude ACS. In a study of 40 patients presenting with suspected ACS, a high prevalence of noncalcified plaques was observed. Moreover, in a substantial proportion of patients, CAD was present despite the absence of calcium. In total, 85 percent of patients with no calcium had atherosclerosis and in 39 percent a significant stenosis was identified, suggesting that the absence of coronary calcium does not reliably exclude the presence of CAD in patients with suspected ACS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/noninvasive-coronary-imaging-with-cardiac-computed-tomography-and-cardiovascular-magnetic-resonance/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>].</p><p/><p>There are no specific studies on coronary magnetic resonance imaging (CMRI) in the setting of ACS.
