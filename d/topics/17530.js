The nature and severity of the injury depends upon the injury mechanism. Injuries range from minor bruising to complete devascularization for blunt injuries and small perforations to devascularization for penetrating injuries. Associated solid organ injury is common. </p><p>The duodenum is frequently injured in association with the pancreas, and the management of these combined injuries is complex. The diagnosis and management of duodenal injuries is reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-duodenal-and-pancreatic-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of duodenal and pancreatic trauma in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis and management of gastrointestinal injury (except duodenum) due to trauma is reviewed here. The general approach to the abdominal trauma patient is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of blunt abdominal trauma in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-stab-wounds-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of abdominal stab wounds in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-abdominal-gunshot-wounds-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of abdominal gunshot wounds in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H197204457\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H169106595\"><span class=\"h2\">Stomach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The stomach is located in the left upper quadrant of the abdomen but can occupy other areas of the abdomen depending upon its degree of distention, phase of diaphragmatic excursion, and the positioning of the individual at the time of the injury. Anteriorly, the stomach is adjacent to the left lobe of the liver, diaphragm, colon, and anterior abdominal wall. Posteriorly, the stomach is adjacent to the pancreas, spleen, left kidney and adrenal gland, splenic artery, left diaphragm, transverse mesocolon, and colon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F56689\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56689 \">figure 1</a>). </p><p>The blood supply of the stomach is from the gastric arteries. The left gastric artery, which is derived from the celiac artery, courses along the lesser curvature of the stomach and anastomoses with the right gastric artery, which is a branch of the common hepatic artery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F56689\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56689 \">figure 1</a>). The right and left gastroepiploic arteries arise from the gastroduodenal artery and splenic arteries, respectively, and anastomose along the greater curvature. The short gastric arteries arise from the splenic artery and supply the fundus of the stomach. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H169106603\"><span class=\"h2\">Small bowel</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The small bowel is anatomically divided into three portions: the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. The anatomy of the duodenum is discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-duodenal-and-pancreatic-trauma-in-adults#H651340813\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of duodenal and pancreatic trauma in adults&quot;, section on 'Duodenal and pancreatic anatomy'</a>.)</p><p>The jejunum begins at the ligament of Treitz, and there are no true anatomic boundaries that delineate the jejunum from ileum. The jejunum tends to have more adipose tissue in the associated mesentery, and its vascular arcades are fewer and longer when compared with the ileum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F85571\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef85571 \">figure 2</a>). The jejunum and ileum measure between 6 and 7 meters long and are attached to the posterior abdominal wall by the mesentery. </p><p>The arterial supply, venous drainage, autonomic nerves, lymph nodes, and a variable amount of adipose tissue are contained between the layers of the small bowel mesentery. The superior mesenteric artery (SMA) provides the blood supply to the jejunum and ileum and originates from the aorta approximately 1 centimeter below the origin of the celiac trunk (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F51087\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51087 \">figure 3</a>). The superior mesenteric vein lies anterior and to the right of the artery and joins the splenic vein to form the portal vein behind the neck of the pancreas.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H169106611\"><span class=\"h2\">Colon and rectum</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The colon and rectum occupy retroperitoneal and intraperitoneal spaces, in close approximation to solid organs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F60998\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60998 \">figure 4</a>). The ascending and descending colon are retroperitoneal, while the transverse colon, which extends from the hepatic flexure to the splenic flexure, is intraperitoneal. The sigmoid colon continues from the descending colon, ending where the teniae converge to form the rectum. The rectum is the distal continuation of the colon, measuring 12 to 15 cm in length. The rectum lies anterior to the three inferior sacral vertebrae, the coccyx, and sacral vessels and is posterior to the bladder in men and the vagina in women. The anterior upper two-thirds of the rectum are located intraperitoneally, and the remainder is extraperitoneal. </p><p>The blood supply to the colon is derived from the superior (SMA) and inferior mesenteric arteries (IMA), and internal iliac artery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F73756\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73756 \">figure 5</a>). The SMA, ileocolic, right colic, and middle colic arteries supply the cecum, right colon, and first portion of the transverse colon, respectively. The venous outflow generally follows the arterial supply (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F81960\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81960 \">figure 6</a>). The transverse colon derives its blood supply from both the SMA and IMA. The watershed area between these vessels is at risk for ischemia. The descending and sigmoid colon are supplied by the left colic artery and the superior sigmoid artery, branches of the IMA. The rectum is supplied by the superior, middle rectal, and inferior rectal artery. Venous drainage from the rectum is from the superior rectal and middle rectal veins draining to the inferior mesenteric veins, and the inferior rectal veins draining to the internal pudendal veins. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H533808630\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gastrointestinal injury can be due to blunt mechanisms (motor vehicle crash, pedestrian injury, falls) or penetrating mechanisms (knife, gunshot, shotgun). Most blunt gastrointestinal injuries are due to motor vehicle crashes with an increased risk for those wearing a seatbelt <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> in the front seat passenger position. A multi-institutional prospective review of 95 trauma centers by the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST Hollow Viscus Injury in Blunt Trauma Study) identified 275,557 trauma admissions and found that patients involved in a motor vehicle crash are 1.5 times more likely to sustain a gastrointestinal injury compared with other mechanisms of blunt abdominal trauma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-gastrointestinal-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22697869\"><span class=\"h2\">Blunt injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mechanism of blunt gastrointestinal injury is typically due to crushing of the bowel between the solid structures of the body such as the spine or pelvis and steering wheel, seatbelt, or handle bar (bicycle, motorcycle) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-gastrointestinal-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In the EAST Hollow Viscus Injury Study, the incidence of gastrointestinal injury among patients receiving an abdominal workup for trauma was 3.1 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-gastrointestinal-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In order of frequency, gastrointestinal injury occurred more commonly in the small bowel <span class=\"nowrap\">(jejunum/ileum)</span> followed by <span class=\"nowrap\">colon/rectum,</span> duodenum, stomach, and appendix. The risk for full-thickness injury followed the same pattern. The mechanism of injury to specific organs following blunt trauma is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stomach<strong> &ndash; </strong>Rupture of the stomach is relatively uncommon because of its relatively protected anatomic location. The incidence of stomach perforation following blunt trauma ranges from 0.02 to 1.7 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-gastrointestinal-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/4-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-8</a>]. When rupture does occur, the anterior wall is more commonly affected, and approximately 95 percent of stomach injuries are associated with injuries to other solid and hollow organs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-gastrointestinal-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/5,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,8</a>]. The risk of perforation may be higher for patients with preexisting gastric distention, such as following a meal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-gastrointestinal-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Increasing severity of abdominal injury is associated with a greater risk for gastric injury. Compared with patients who have small bowel <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> colon injuries, patients with blunt gastric injuries have a higher Injury Severity Score (ISS; 22 versus 17) and a higher percentage of patients with a chest Abbreviated Injury Scores (AIS) &gt;2 (36 versus 12 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-gastrointestinal-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Small bowel &ndash; Small bowel injury is associated with injury mechanisms that include front seat passenger position in motor vehicle crashes, falls, and pedestrians struck by automobiles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-gastrointestinal-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Small bowel injuries associated with blunt trauma were contusions limited to the bowel serosa in contrast to penetrating injuries that typically result in perforation. However, almost one-third of mesenteric injuries resulted in a devascularized bowel segment that ultimately required resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-gastrointestinal-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. If a perforation was identified, it was most likely to be in the jejunum. Blunt small intestinal injury can be difficult to detect because a full-thickness bowel injury may not be immediately present in contrast to the immediate intestinal leakage that is typical of penetrating intestinal injury. Following blunt intestinal injury, full-thickness necrosis and intestinal rupture may develop over days.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Colon and rectum &ndash; Colonic and rectal injuries are relatively uncommon. Blunt injury to the mesentery occurs commonly at transition points where the mobile portions of the colon become fixed retroperitoneally, such as in the region of the ileocecal valve and sigmoid colon. The rectum can be injured in association with pelvic fractures. Colonic injury can be particularly difficult to diagnose due to the retroperitoneal location of much of the colon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-gastrointestinal-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22697876\"><span class=\"h2\">Penetrating injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Any implement or missile that enters the abdomen can injure the bowel. Depending upon the girth of the victim and force applied, even a short implement that penetrates the abdominal wall can cause gastrointestinal injury, particularly in patients with prior abdominal surgery and bowel adhesions. </p><p>The risk of specific organ injury from penetrating trauma depends upon the instrument used (eg, blunt or sharp), site of penetration, and trajectory and velocity of the missile or object. Gunshot or shotgun wounds are more likely to result in multiple injuries to the hollow viscera compared with stab wounds because of their high energy. A blast injury can also result surrounding the tract of a projectile, particularly when fired from a high-velocity weapon. The blast injury can result in devascularization that may evolve over several days to become a perforating wound. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H239075955\"><span class=\"h2\">Associated injuries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Injuries associated with <span class=\"nowrap\">lap/seatbelt</span> use, such as flexion-distraction fractures of the spine (Chance fractures) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F60907\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef60907 \">image 1</a>) and injury to solid organs (eg, kidney, pancreas) should prompt an evaluation for an associated gastrointestinal injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-gastrointestinal-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/4-8,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-8,11</a>].

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blunt-genitourinary-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blunt genitourinary trauma: Initial evaluation and management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penetrating-trauma-of-the-upper-and-lower-genitourinary-tract-initial-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Penetrating trauma of the upper and lower genitourinary tract: Initial evaluation and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H239075588\"><span class=\"h1\">TRAUMA EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We perform the initial resuscitation, diagnostic evaluation, and management of the patient with blunt or penetrating injury based upon protocols from the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) program, established by the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma.

If the clinical setting allows, a Focused Assessment with Sonography for Trauma (FAST) exam or diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL) may be performed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-adults#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of blunt abdominal trauma in adults&quot;, section on 'Ultrasound'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-adults#H13\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of blunt abdominal trauma in adults&quot;, section on 'Diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL)'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>FAST exam &ndash; Although the FAST serves as a screening tool for the detection of hemoperitoneum in blunt abdominal trauma, FAST is not sensitive for detecting gastrointestinal injury unless there is significant fluid volume of spilled enteric contents from a perforated viscus, or blood from a mesenteric laceration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-gastrointestinal-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. For patients with blunt abdominal trauma and gastrointestinal injury, the positive predictive value of FAST is low at approximately 40 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-gastrointestinal-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Although FAST has little role in the initial evaluation of penetrating abdominal trauma, it may be helpful for decision making in multi-cavitary penetrating trauma. In a prospective study of 75 consecutive patients with penetrating trauma to the abdomen, flank, or back, the overall sensitivity of FAST was 46 percent, the specificity was 94 percent, and the accuracy was 68 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-gastrointestinal-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Thus, a negative FAST, particularly if there is a high clinical suspicion of gastrointestinal injury, should be further evaluated using additional imaging, such as a computed tomography or DPL scan, or abdominal exploration. (See <a href=\"#H239077328\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diagnostic peritoneal lavage &ndash; DPL is a rapid and inexpensive procedure that may demonstrate spilled intraluminal contents as a result of bowel perforation. With the introduction of FAST and refinements in computed tomography, the indications for DPL have decreased, and, although rarely needed, DPL may be a useful adjunct in patients who do not have indications for immediate intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-gastrointestinal-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. When performed, the lavage fluid can be assessed for a white blood cell count (WBC), amylase, and alkaline phosphatase values [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-gastrointestinal-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/18-21\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-21</a>]. The fluid can also be stained for vegetable fibers, bile, and bacteria to identify contents from a hollow viscus perforation, but the diagnostic utility is low [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-gastrointestinal-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. A positive test (WBC &gt;500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/mm<sup>3</sup>,</span> alkaline phosphatase level &gt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/L,</span> amylase level &gt;20 <span class=\"nowrap\">IU/L,</span> or a positive identification of fibers or enteric contents) indicates the need for abdominal exploration. (See <a href=\"#H538028240\" class=\"local\">'Approach to management'</a> below and <a href=\"#H197204297\" class=\"local\">'Abdominal exploration'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H538030155\"><span class=\"h2\">History and physical</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The trauma history should assess the risk for gastrointestinal injury based upon mechanism. Injury mechanisms associated with gastrointestinal injury are discussed above. (See <a href=\"#H533808630\" class=\"local\">'Mechanism of injury'</a> above.)</p><p>The trauma patient may complain of abdominal pain, but this symptom is not specific for gastrointestinal injury. Physical examination findings that suggest a possible gastrointestinal injury include abdominal wall ecchymosis, abdominal distention, abdominal tenderness, or signs of peritoneal irritation, but these signs are also not specific for gastrointestinal injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-gastrointestinal-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, finding no abdominal pain or tenderness significantly decreases the likelihood of finding a gastrointestinal injury that would require surgery. In the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) Multi-Institutional Hollow Viscus Injury in Blunt Trauma study, patients with nonperforated small bowel injuries or no small bowel injury were significantly less likely to have abdominal tenderness compared with patients with perforation (53 percent for nonperforated injury, 23 percent no small bowel injury, 72 percent for perforation) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-gastrointestinal-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Abdominal distention or peritoneal signs were observed in 4 and 10 percent, respectively, of those who did not have gastrointestinal injury. Thus, the majority of patients who do not demonstrate these signs will not have a gastrointestinal injury.</p><p>A finding of gross blood on digital rectal examination is a sign of possible rectal injury, particularly in patients with open pelvic fractures. A sigmoidoscopy, which is typically performed under anesthesia, is needed to definitively evaluate or exclude this injury. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H239076452\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no specific laboratory tests diagnostic for gastrointestinal injury. An initially elevated white blood cell count in the trauma patient is common and frequently related only to the physical stress of trauma. In one study, there were no significant differences in initial red blood cell and white blood cell counts for patients with perforated small bowel injury, nonperforated small bowel injury, or no small bowel injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-gastrointestinal-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. However, an increasing or persistently elevated white blood cell count in the patient with abdominal injury may indicate a developing intra-abdominal process, alerting the clinician to a potential gastrointestinal injury. (See <a href=\"#H538028240\" class=\"local\">'Approach to management'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H239077328\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A definitive diagnosis of traumatic gastrointestinal injury is made at abdominal exploration; however, physical exam and imaging studies, specifically computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen, are important adjuncts that may influence the decision to explore the abdomen.</p><p>Plain abdominal films may indicate a traumatic gastrointestinal injury overtly as with a finding of pneumoperitoneum (free air), but the trajectory of a missile (ie, gunshot), or presence of a foreign body (eg, bullet, shrapnel) may strongly suggest that a gastrointestinal injury is likely to have occurred. Plain films are not needed if abdominal CT will be performed; however, trajectory mapping may be useful in operative planning or to help determine the need and extent of further imaging. </p><p>CT of the abdomen is the test of choice for identifying specific intra-abdominal injuries in hemodynamically stable patients with blunt injury and is the most sensitive noninvasive imaging test for identifying gastrointestinal injury [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-gastrointestinal-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/2,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,22</a>]. The role of CT scanning in hemodynamically stable patients with suspected penetrating injury is less well defined. CT may be useful to differentiate patients for whom abdominal exploration is needed from those with injuries that can be appropriately managed nonoperatively, such as patients with a <span class=\"nowrap\">low/transpelvic</span> trajectory not involving the rectum, a trajectory across the superior abdomen suggestive of an isolated solid organ injury, and possibly those with a lateral trajectory (ie, &quot;love handles&quot; hit) that may have missed the abdomen altogether. For single penetrating wounds, the sensitivity of CT with trajectography was 96 percent in one study; however, it was only 80 percent when there were multiple wounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-gastrointestinal-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

Absolute indications for immediate operative intervention include hemodynamic instability, diffuse abdominal pain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> peritonitis on clinical examination, or findings on initial imaging studies consistent with gastrointestinal perforation (pneumoperitoneum, spilled intraluminal contrast, bowel infarction). In hemodynamically stable patients with abdominal trauma without peritonitis or clear radiographic evidence of gastrointestinal injury, selective nonoperative management is an alternative. </p><p>For patients with blunt abdominal injury, observational studies support nonoperative management in the setting of a benign abdominal exam and negative or equivocal computed tomography (CT) scan findings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-gastrointestinal-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/17,45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,45,46</a>]. Mesenteric hematomas identified on CT scan due to blunt injury that are not associated with active contrast extravasation or signs of bowel compromise can also be observed if there are no other operative injuries identified. Many of these hematomas will resorb spontaneously and will not cause any clinical sequelae. However, it is important to note that patients with mesenteric hematoma can develop delayed peritonitis from bowel ischemia that may take several days to develop. Thus, the traditional &quot;24 hour&quot; observation rule discussed below does not apply to patients with potential devascularization injuries. (See <a href=\"#H538028604\" class=\"local\">'Control of mesenteric bleeding'</a> below.)</p><p>Although less accepted, there is a growing body of evidence to support selective nonoperative management of penetrating abdominal injury. In a large retrospective review, 792 hemodynamically stable patients with abdominal gunshot wounds (no peritoneal signs, reliable clinical examination) were observed with serial abdominal exams and laboratory studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-gastrointestinal-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. Of these, 10 percent developed delayed symptoms requiring laparotomy. The rate of nontherapeutic laparotomy was 14 percent but would have been 47 percent if routine laparotomy had been performed. Complications attributed to delay in operation were observed in 0.3 percent with no increase in mortality. Although the precise duration of observation should be tailored for each individual case based on the clinical course, a minimum observation time of 12 hours for abdominal stab wounds and 24 hours for gunshot wounds in the clinically stable patent has been recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-gastrointestinal-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. </p><p>Selective observation of patients with abdominal injury consists of serial abdominal examination, repeat laboratory studies, and repeat imaging (usually CT scan), as needed. The main component is frequent serial abdominal examinations, ideally conducted hourly by a member of a dedicated team. For this reason, patients who are unable to provide a reliable physical exam, such as those with coexistent severe brain injury, spinal cord injury, altered mental status, and patients undergoing anesthesia (nonabdominal injury), are not candidates for observation. Clinical signs during the period of observation that suggest the presence of a bowel injury include progressively worsening abdominal pain, hemodynamic instability, or intolerance of oral intake. Monitoring the white cell count may contribute to the clinical picture if significantly or persistently elevated. However, no conclusive data regarding the utility of this parameter exist [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-gastrointestinal-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. White blood cell count should be obtained on admission and serial counts obtained every six hours until resolution or the need for surgical exploration reveals itself. When indicated, surgical intervention should be undertaken expeditiously to minimize morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-gastrointestinal-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/13,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,51</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H909659935\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGERY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When gastrointestinal injury is identified or confirmed at abdominal exploration, the injured bowel can be repaired primarily or resected with an immediate or delayed anastomosis. The choice depends upon the clinical status of the patient, the severity of the specific injury, site of injury, and number and relationship of hollow viscus injuries to each other. The decision also needs to take into account the presence of other traumatic injuries (eg, liver, spleen). At times, a damage control approach may be needed and is accomplished by quickly securing the injured stomach or bowel to stop bleeding <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> gastrointestinal leakage. Definitive repair or resection can be delayed for up to 24 hours [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-gastrointestinal-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].

However, in patients suspected of having a gastrointestinal injury, the grade and site of injury cannot be known for certain. If upper and lower tract injuries are suspected, or the site and severity are unknown, broad-spectrum coverage is appropriate. Antibiotic choices are given in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F65369\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65369 \">table 2</a>), and perioperative coverage is usually sufficient.

However, we do not generally advocate this approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-gastrointestinal-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/63\" class=\"abstract_t\">63</a>]. For appropriate candidates in whom reliable serial abdominal examinations can be performed, we prefer selective, nonoperative management. (See <a href=\"#H538028240\" class=\"local\">'Approach to management'</a> above.)</p><p>In accordance with accepted trauma protocols, injuries to the gastrointestinal tract should be evaluated and repaired in a systematic manner. Control of intra-abdominal hemorrhage (spleen, liver, mesentery) should be the first priority to minimize the need for transfusion and minimize fluid requirements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-gastrointestinal-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>], followed by control of gastrointestinal contamination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-gastrointestinal-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Patients who are hemodynamically stable with limited other injuries can undergo definitive management of their bowel injuries at the time of the initial exploration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-gastrointestinal-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,66</a>]. In the setting of damage control, repair of gastrointestinal injury should be delayed until after hemodynamic stabilization, which is typically within 24 hours of the injury. Repair should be undertaken no later than 48 to 72 hours after injury because bowel distention can extend the injury. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-damage-control-surgery-and-resuscitation-in-patients-sustaining-severe-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of damage control surgery and resuscitation in patients sustaining severe injury&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The anterior and posterior surfaces of the stomach should be inspected for signs of contusion or laceration. The posterior surface can be examined after opening the lesser sac. Ligating a few of the short gastric arteries will facilitate exposure. Small gastric perforations can be identified by injecting air into the nasogastric tube to insufflate the stomach and then filling the abdomen with saline to cover the stomach while observing for air bubbles. Alternatively, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylene-blue-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylene blue</a> can be instilled into the stomach via the nasogastric tube and the stomach inspected for leakage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The entire bowel and mesentery, beginning from the ligament of Treitz, should be examined. All abnormalities should be thoroughly evaluated and tagged (eg, bowel clamp), but definitive repair should not be undertaken until the entire length of bowel has been examined. (See <a href=\"#H791235263\" class=\"local\">'Management of intestinal injuries'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation of duodenal injury requires mobilizing the duodenum from its retroperitoneal attachments, and the pancreas, which is commonly injured as well, should also be examined. Duodenal and pancreatic injuries are discussed in detail separately.

Active mesenteric arterial bleeding can usually be controlled with simple ligation. Due to the rich collateral blood supply to most areas of the small intestine, limited ligation of mesenteric arterial vessels will not result in bowel compromise, but multiple ligations, proximal arterial branch ligation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F85571\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef85571 \">figure 2</a>), or mesenteric resection may necessitate resection of the associated bowel. Once the injury to the mesentery has been managed, the viability of the bowel should be assessed. (See <a href=\"#H791235395\" class=\"local\">'Evaluating bowel viability'</a> below.)</p><p>Most mesenteric venous injuries can be ligated without sequelae. Although ligation of the inferior mesenteric vein is well tolerated, the superior mesenteric vein (SMV) should be preserved whenever possible. If ligation of the SMV is necessary, the surgeon should consider temporary abdominal closure and &quot;second-look operation&quot; given the potential for massive bowel edema. (See <a href=\"#H538030097\" class=\"local\">'Abdominal closure'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H791235395\"><span class=\"h2\">Evaluating bowel viability</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The integrity of the bowel should be carefully inspected, particularly in areas of mesenteric injury. Areas of bowel for which the viability is uncertain should be observed throughout the course of the operation. A warm (not hot) laparotomy pad can be placed over the region to promote blood flow. The patient's hemodynamic status should be reevaluated and hypotension corrected, avoiding vasoconstricting agents if possible. </p><p>Bowel viability is generally assessed in the operating room using a combination of clinical experience and judgment, a handheld continuous wave Doppler to assess for audible arterial signals within the mesentery and bowel wall, and intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorescein-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorescein</a> administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-gastrointestinal-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/67-73\" class=\"abstract_t\">67-73</a>]. Within a few minutes of giving fluorescein (1 to 2 ampules, 500 mg each), examination of the bowel with ultraviolet light (ie, Woods lamp) will show perfused regions as bright green while areas of ischemia will appear darker by comparison. If warming and improvement in the patient's blood pressure do not improve intestinal perfusion, resection of the affected segment may be required. Areas of bowel that are potentially viable should not be resected immediately; rather, a second-look operation should be planned for no later than 24 hours after the initial procedure. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H791235263\"><span class=\"h2\">Management of intestinal injuries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Whether a specific injury should be repaired or resected depends upon the grade of bowel injury (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F76656\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76656 \">table 1</a>), the presence of other closely associated hollow viscus injuries, the adequacy of perfusion to the segment of bowel, and the patient's overall clinical status. Immediate resection is indicated for overtly infarcted segments of bowel and devascularized bowel segments. Resection is frequently necessary for multiple injuries affecting the same bowel segment. Resected segments of stomach, small bowel, colon, and intraperitoneal rectum can be reapproximated primarily without proximal diversion (ostomy creation) under most circumstances. For patients with severe and multiple injuries, a damage-control approach involves resecting the affected segments of bowel using a gastrointestinal stapler and delaying restoration of gastrointestinal continuity until the patient has stabilized.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H70383561\"><span class=\"h3\">Repair techniques</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Options for intestinal repair include using a one-layer or two-layer hand-sewn technique or a stapled technique. The choice of technique depends upon the location of the injury, the nature and extent of the patient's other injuries, and surgeon experience and preference. </p><p>A stapled technique can be liberally applied to small and large bowel anastomoses when managing traumatic gastrointestinal injuries when there is a minimal size discrepancy between the ends of the bowel. Hand-sewn and stapled techniques have been shown in observational studies to have similar complication rates (eg, anastomotic leak, infection) in the trauma population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-gastrointestinal-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/74-78\" class=\"abstract_t\">74-78</a>]. However, it is important to remember that bowel edema from the traumatic injury can prevent proper closure with a gastrointestinal stapler [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-gastrointestinal-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. </p><p>The stomach is highly vascular and is usually closed using two layers to provide better hemostasis. In a two-layer closure, the inner layer is a running, absorbable suture and the outer layer is interrupted, permanent (eg, silk) Lembert sutures. An alternative to a hand-sewn closure for a gastric laceration is closure using a gastrointestinal anastomosis (GIA) stapler. </p><p>Intestinal anastomoses can be performed using a one-layer or two-layer hand-sewn or stapled technique. Single-layer hand-sewn anastomosis is constructed using a running 3-0 permanent (eg, polypropylene) suture while the two-layer technique uses a running, absorbable suture for the inner layer and interrupted, permanent (eg, silk) Lembert sutures for the outer layer. In a randomized trial of 125 patients undergoing elective surgery, no differences in complication rates or lengths of hospital stay were found for a one-layer versus a two-layer technique for intestinal anastomosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-gastrointestinal-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H70383435\"><span class=\"h3\">Repair by injury grade</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Low-grade injuries (grade I, II, or III) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F76656\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76656 \">table 1</a>) of the stomach, small bowel, colon, and rectum can usually be repaired primarily, whereas higher grade injuries are generally not amenable to primary repair and will require resection.

Risk factors that have previously been associated with breakdown of colon repairs have included significant comorbid conditions, &gt;6 units of blood transfusion, shock, delay in operation, and heavy fecal contamination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-gastrointestinal-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/86,87\" class=\"abstract_t\">86,87</a>]. However, a prospective, multicenter trial undertaken by the American Association for Surgery in Trauma (AAST) that included 297 patients found that the surgical method of colon repair did not influence the rate of abdominal complications, regardless of associated risk factors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-gastrointestinal-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. </p><p>For extraperitoneal rectal injuries, diverting colostomy alone may be adequate for managing penetrating rectal injury (missile, penetrating bony fragment), which has traditionally been managed with primary repair, presacral drainage, rectal washout, and proximal diversion (colostomy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-gastrointestinal-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/83,84\" class=\"abstract_t\">83,84</a>]. In one small trial of 48 patients with penetrating rectal injuries, no differences in outcome were found whether or not presacral drainage was used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-gastrointestinal-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H538030097\"><span class=\"h2\">Abdominal closure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following trauma surgery, a decision to close the abdomen with or without skin closure depends upon the ability to approximate the fascial edges, the amount of intra-abdominal contamination, the potential for anastomotic breakdown, and the need to perform a second-look operation. In patients undergoing damage control surgery and in those with a planned second-look operation to assess bowel viability, the abdomen should be left open and a temporary abdominal closure used. Leaving the abdomen open may also be more prudent in patients who are at risk for abdominal compartment syndrome. Methods of diagnosing abdominal compartment syndrome and the management of the open abdomen are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abdominal-compartment-syndrome-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Abdominal compartment syndrome in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-open-abdomen-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the open abdomen in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>When the abdominal fascia is closed, the question of whether to close the skin is unresolved.

Thus, with injury to the colon, rectum, or in cases of a large volume of material spilled from the stomach or small bowel, we prefer to loosely approximate the skin edges with staples, which can be easily removed should an infection become apparent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H791235782\"><span class=\"h3\">Role of drains</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data are limited regarding the use of intra-abdominal drains in emergency trauma surgery. Extrapolating from data obtained in elective surgery, we prefer not to use drains following repair or resection of most gastrointestinal injuries. One notable exception is stomach injuries requiring total gastrectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-gastrointestinal-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. Although the systematic review identified no specific data, expert consensus concluded that drains should be used following total gastrectomy with esophageal-jejunal anastomosis because of the high mortality rates associated with anastomotic leak [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-gastrointestinal-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>].

In a prospective study of 178 patients with penetrating abdominal injury, the overall incidence of surgical site infection (SSI; wound infection, fascial dehiscence, or intra-abdominal abscess) was 20 percent and the incidence of enterocutaneous fistula was 3.4 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-gastrointestinal-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/96\" class=\"abstract_t\">96</a>]. Risk factors for SSI included duodenal and colonic injuries. When patients with colon injuries were excluded, the SSI was 16 percent for patients with gastric injuries and 13 percent for those with small bowel injuries. In contrast to the EAST study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-gastrointestinal-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>], there was no association between SSI and time to operative management. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H75801954\"><span class=\"h1\">MORTALITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mortality in patients with gastrointestinal injury is related to overall injury severity (ISS) score, associated solid organ and vascular injuries, and medical comorbidities. Mortality related directly to the gastrointestinal injury is most closely related to a delay in initial diagnosis, intra-abdominal sepsis, and development of multiorgan failure. In a retrospective review of 268 patients with gastrointestinal injury, mortality rates were 28 percent for injuries to the stomach, 19 percent for rectal injuries, and 15 percent for small bowel injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-gastrointestinal-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p>Mortality rates for patients sustaining a ruptured stomach have been reported between 28 and 66 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-gastrointestinal-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/1,2,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,8</a>]. The higher mortality rate for stomach injury appeared to be related to the more severe injury mechanism needed to cause gastric perforation, and multiple other associated organ injuries (eg, spleen, diaphragm, lung), as evidenced by higher mean injury severity scores [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-gastrointestinal-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>A delay in diagnosis &ge;24 hours in patients found to have isolated blunt small bowel injury was associated with a significantly higher mortality compared with diagnosis at &lt;24 hours (16 versus 4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-gastrointestinal-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In the Eastern Association for the Surgery of Trauma (EAST) Hollow Viscus Injury in Blunt Trauma Study, patients with small bowel injury were significantly more likely to die compared with patients sustaining blunt abdominal trauma who did not have small bowel injury (19 versus 14 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-gastrointestinal-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>A multicenter study of patients who survived the first 72 hours after penetrating colon injury found an overall colon-injury-related mortality rate of 1.3 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/traumatic-gastrointestinal-injury-in-the-adult-patient/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. All the patients who died were treated with a proximal diversion at the time of initial procedure, and death was ultimately the result of intra-abdominal sepsis and multiorgan failure. The need for colostomy is a marker of severe injury. (See <a href=\"#H75801689\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H909660042\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Gastrointestinal injury refers to injury of the stomach, small bowel, colon, or rectum due to traumatic mechanisms, which can be blunt or penetrating. Gastrointestinal injury is less common than solid organ injury and occurs more often following penetrating than blunt trauma. The nature and severity of the injury depends upon the injury mechanism, with injuries ranging from minor bruising to complete devascularization. (See <a href=\"#H1065773\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The clinical evaluation of the trauma patient should assess the risk for gastrointestinal injury based upon injury mechanism. Although physical examination findings (eg, wall ecchymosis, abdominal distention, abdominal tenderness, or signs of peritoneal irritation) may suggest intra-abdominal injury, these signs are not specific for gastrointestinal injury. (See <a href=\"#H239075588\" class=\"local\">'Trauma evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In conjunction with physical examination, computed tomography (CT) is the test of choice for identifying specific intra-abdominal injuries in the hemodynamically stable trauma patient and is the most sensitive noninvasive test for identifying gastrointestinal injury. Findings on CT scan that suggest a gastrointestinal injury include free air (pneumoperitoneum), mesenteric air, extraluminal enteric contrast, discontinuity of the wall of a hollow viscus, free intra-abdominal fluid in the absence of solid organ injury, bowel wall thickening, active bleeding (extravasated intravenous contrast), evidence of bowel infarct, and mesenteric hematoma. A diagnostic peritoneal lavage (DPL) may be useful if CT scan is equivocal, but, ultimately, abdominal exploration is required to establish the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H239077328\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with abdominal trauma who are hemodynamically unstable, patients with known gastrointestinal injury, and those with other abdominal injuries that require operative intervention should be taken to the operating room for open abdominal exploration. Observation may be appropriate for selected hemodynamically stable patients in the absence of peritonitis when no other operative injuries are present, imaging studies are equivocal for gastrointestinal injury, and a reliable physical exam is possible. Mesenteric and intramural hematomas can resolve without the need for surgery. (See <a href=\"#H538028240\" class=\"local\">'Approach to management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We use the American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) Organ Injury system to grade gastrointestinal injuries based upon CT findings or findings in the operating room. Grading can help guide surgical management of the injury. A damage control approach to bowel injury may be needed when severe associated injuries are present and is accomplished by quickly securing the injured stomach or bowel to stop bleeding <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> gastrointestinal leakage. Definitive repair or resection can be delayed for up to 24 hours. (See <a href=\"#H909659935\" class=\"local\">'Surgery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The decision to perform a primary repair or resect injured bowel depends upon the severity and location of the injury, and proximity of the injuries to each other. Grade I, II, and III injuries of the stomach, small bowel, colon, and rectum can usually be repaired primarily; however, multiple injuries along the same segment or higher-grade injuries (grade IV, V) typically need resection. (See <a href=\"#H197204333\" class=\"local\">'Injury grading'</a> above and <a href=\"#H791235263\" class=\"local\">'Management of intestinal injuries'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For most patients with colon or intraperitoneal rectal injuries, we suggest primary repair, or resection and re-anastomosis (as appropriate), but without a diverting colostomy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For most patients with extraperitoneal rectal injuries, proximal diverting colostomy alone is sufficient. (See <a href=\"#H629604702\" class=\"local\">'Colorectal injuries'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients undergoing total gastrectomy for trauma, we suggest the placement of an intra-abdominal drain at the esophagojejunal anastomosis rather than no drainage (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For other gastrointestinal injuries, we suggest not placing drains following repair or resection (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H791235782\" class=\"local\">'Role of drains'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Following exploratory laparotomy for trauma, the abdominal wall may need to remain open because of the risk for abdominal compartment syndrome, or the need for a planned second-look procedure (damage control).
