The great toenail is most commonly affected. Characteristic signs and symptoms include pain, edema, exudate, and granulation tissue. Predisposing factors include poorly fitting shoes, excessive trimming of the lateral nail plate, pincer nail deformity (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F59295\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef59295 \">picture 2</a>), and trauma. The diagnosis is based upon clinical appearance and rarely is difficult.</p><p>This topic will discuss the management of ingrown toenails. Paronychia and other skin disorders are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=paronychia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Paronychia&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-nail-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of nail disorders&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2399621567\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment of ingrown toenails depends upon the severity of the lesion. All patients should be educated about proper nail trimming; the lateral nail plate should be allowed to grow well beyond the lateral nail fold before trimming horizontally. Patients should also be educated about the importance of well-fitting shoes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1580480267\"><span class=\"h3\">Mild to moderate lesion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mild to moderate lesions are characterized by minimal to moderate pain, little erythema, and no discharge. Two options for conservative treatment are as follows [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ingrown-toenails/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Place a cotton wedging or dental floss underneath the lateral nail plate to separate the nail plate from the lateral nail fold, or use tape to pull the lateral nail fold away from a spicule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ingrown-toenails/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], thereby relieving pressure. An additional option called &quot;cotton nail cast&quot; has been proposed for mild ingrown toenail. Without anesthesia, a piece of cotton (u-shaped), is placed with forceps between the nail plate and inflamed tissue, secured with a cyanoacrylate liquid glue, and allowed to harden to form a &quot;cast&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ingrown-toenails/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Soak the affected foot in warm, soapy water for 10 to 20 minutes three times per day for one to two weeks, pushing the lateral nail fold away from the nail plate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ingrown-toenails/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Alternatively, a solution of water mixed with 1 to 2 teaspoons of Epsom salts can be used [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ingrown-toenails/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. A medium- to high-potency topical corticosteroid can be applied after soaking to reduce inflammation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=DERM%2F62402\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62402 \">table 1</a>).</p><p/><p>Over 70 percent of patients respond to conservative therapy. Nonresponders may need to undergo more aggressive therapy. (See <a href=\"#H2326697786\" class=\"local\">'Moderate to severe lesion'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2326697786\"><span class=\"h3\">Moderate to severe lesion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Moderate to severe lesions are characterized by substantial erythema and pus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F60735\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60735 \">picture 3</a>). Treatment consists of the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Perform an appropriate digital block with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">lidocaine</a> 1% without epinephrine (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digital-nerve-block\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Digital nerve block&quot;</a>). EMLA (eutectic mixture of lidocaine [2.5 percent] and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prilocaine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prilocaine</a> [2.5 percent] in a cream base) has not been proven helpful in reducing the pain of injection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Using nail-splitting scissors or a hemostat, insert the instrument under the nail plate and remove the involved nail wedge with nail clippers or scissors.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Remove any granulation tissue with a curette <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> <a href=\"topic.htm?path=silver-nitrate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">silver nitrate</a> sticks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dilute hydrogen peroxide 1:1 with tap water and cleanse the surgical site with cotton swabs two or three times a day, followed by application of either <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bacitracin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bacitracin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mupirocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mupirocin</a> ointment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Many elect to treat secondary infections with oral antibiotics. However, in a study of 54 patients with ingrown toenails (patients who were immunocompromised, had peripheral vascular disease, or had cellulitis were excluded), the use of antibiotics in association with nail border resection did not decrease healing time nor postprocedure morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ingrown-toenails/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Follow up in three to four days to assess treatment and possible spicule formation with nail regrowth. Remember to educate the patient that when the lesion heals and the lateral nail fold is no longer edematous, they should allow the lateral nail plate to grow beyond the lateral nail fold.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An additional option is the placement of a soft plastic tube stent along the affected nail edge (gutter method).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4268560303\"><span class=\"h3\">Recurrent ingrown toenail</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients who suffer recurrent ingrown toenails, consider permanent nail ablation of the lateral nail horn. This is best achieved with the combination of surgical excision plus phenol ablation (chemical matricectomy). In one study, for example, 163 patients (204 ingrowing nail edges) who had not had previous surgery were randomized and treated by total nail avulsion, nail edge excision, or nail edge excision with phenolization of the germinal matrix [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ingrown-toenails/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Recurrence rates one year postoperatively were 73, 73, and 9 percent, respectively.</p><p>A systematic review and meta-analysis concluded that nail avulsion combined with phenol leads to a 75 to 91 percent reduction in the recurrence of ingrowing toenails compared with excisional techniques alone, although there is a higher rate of postoperative secondary infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ingrown-toenails/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. One study described more rapid healing with the use of sodium hydroxide [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ingrown-toenails/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], but until additional studies are performed demonstrating efficacy, safety, and ease of use, we continue to use phenol.</p><p>To perform the procedure, surgical nail avulsion of the involved lateral nail is performed prior to the application of phenol. The central nail plate and uninvolved lateral nail plate is usually left in place. The procedures for partial nail avulsion and chemical matricectomy are discussed separately (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nail-avulsion-and-chemical-matricectomy#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nail avulsion and chemical matricectomy&quot;, section on 'Nail avulsion'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nail-avulsion-and-chemical-matricectomy#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Nail avulsion and chemical matricectomy&quot;, section on 'Chemical matricectomy'</a>). The possibility of partial regrowth, including nail spicules, should be discussed with the patient.</p><p>Surgical ablation with electrocautery, radiofrequency, or carbon dioxide laser are alternatives to destruction of the nail matrix with phenol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-of-ingrown-toenails/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients.
