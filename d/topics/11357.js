It is defined differently by anatomists, physiologists, endoscopists, and pathologists:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anatomically, the EGJ is localized at the level of the angle of His, the point at which the tubular esophagus joins the cardia of the saccular stomach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multimodality-approaches-to-potentially-resectable-esophagogastric-junction-and-gastric-cardia-adenocarcinomas/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Physiologists define the EGJ as the distal border of the lower esophageal sphincter, as determined by manometry.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Endoscopically, the EGJ corresponds to the most proximal extent of the longitudinal gastric folds (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F76055\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76055 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multimodality-approaches-to-potentially-resectable-esophagogastric-junction-and-gastric-cardia-adenocarcinomas/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. It is not the same as the squamocolumnar junction (SCJ), which forms a visible Z-line that marks the juxtaposition between the reddish columnar epithelium lining the gastric cardia and the pale glossy squamous epithelium lining the esophagus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F69873\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef69873 \">picture 1</a>). The SCJ is located approximately 3 to 10 mm proximal to the anatomically defined EGJ [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multimodality-approaches-to-potentially-resectable-esophagogastric-junction-and-gastric-cardia-adenocarcinomas/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

The EGJ is located in the opened specimen by following the mucosa of the tubular esophagus to the top of the gastric folds. The EGJ location as defined by the pathologist is likely more precise than the location that is defined endoscopically, which can be limited both by respiratory and diaphragmatic motion during an endoscopic examination, as well as by the presence of a hiatal hernia.</p><p/><p>The use of anatomic or endoscopic definitions such as &quot;end of the tubular esophagus&quot; or &quot;proximal limit of the gastric folds&quot; to define the EGJ should be avoided as these definitions place the EGJ at a point that can be over 2 cm proximal to the true physiologic EGJ, or 2 cm distal to it, within the cardia of the stomach.</p><p>The gastric cardia is also imprecisely defined (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F79793\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef79793 \">figure 1</a>). Anatomists describe the cardia as that zone of the stomach that is adjacent to the orifice of the tubular esophagus, but there is no anatomical landmark for the distal margin of the cardia. A definition of the cardia commonly used in Japan is the area within 2 cm above and below the EGJ [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multimodality-approaches-to-potentially-resectable-esophagogastric-junction-and-gastric-cardia-adenocarcinomas/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The lack of a clear definition of the EGJ and gastric cardia has contributed to difficulties in classification of these tumors and has hampered definition of the optimal multimodality strategy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H497521\"><span class=\"h2\">AJCC classification</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) staging system of the American Joint Committee on Cancer <span class=\"nowrap\">(AJCC)/Union</span> for International Cancer Control (UICC) for esophageal and gastric cancer is used universally (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111221\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111221 \">table 1</a>). In the most recent (2017, eighth edition) revision of the AJCC staging classification [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multimodality-approaches-to-potentially-resectable-esophagogastric-junction-and-gastric-cardia-adenocarcinomas/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], tumors involving the EGJ with the tumor epicenter no more than 2 cm into the proximal stomach are staged as esophageal cancers. In contrast, EGJ tumors with their epicenter located more than 2 cm into the proximal stomach are staged as stomach cancers, as are all cardia cancers not involving the EGJ, even if they are within 2 cm of the EGJ (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111351\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111351 \">table 2</a>). Other changes from the 2010 classification include the provision of unique prognostic stage groupings based upon clinically determined TNM categories, and unique pathologic (p) and posttreatment pathologic (yp) TNM prognostic stage groupings, which are specific for adenocarcinomas and squamous cell carcinomas. Stage-stratified prognostic estimates for esophageal adenocarcinomas, which are based upon data from the Worldwide Esophageal Cancer Collaboration, are outlined in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111241\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef111241 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multimodality-approaches-to-potentially-resectable-esophagogastric-junction-and-gastric-cardia-adenocarcinomas/abstract/7-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-12</a>].

However, in some cases, it may be difficult to distinguish the type for very locally advanced tumors that obliterate the EGJ and cross boundaries.

However, as noted above, in the newest eighth edition TNM classification system, cancers involving the EGJ that have their epicenter within the proximal 2 cm of the cardia and involve the EGJ are still staged as esophageal cancers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111221\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111221 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multimodality-approaches-to-potentially-resectable-esophagogastric-junction-and-gastric-cardia-adenocarcinomas/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Cancers whose epicenter is more than 2 cm distal from the EGJ, even if the EGJ is involved, and all proximal cardia tumors that do not involve the EGJ (even if they are within 2 cm of the EGJ) are staged as stomach cancers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F111190\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111190 \">table 3</a>).

In general, type I cancers more frequently involve lymph nodes in the upper mediastinum (tracheal bifurcation and above) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multimodality-approaches-to-potentially-resectable-esophagogastric-junction-and-gastric-cardia-adenocarcinomas/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

In addition to achieving a biopsy, the endoscopist should document tumor location relative to both the teeth and the EGJ, tumor length, extent of circumferential involvement, degree of obstruction, and any evidence of Barrett's esophagus to assist with treatment planning. The specific Siewert type (I, II, or III) can often be defined endoscopically, although endoscopic localization of the EGJ can be hindered by the presence of a hiatal hernia and by respiratory and diaphragmatic motion during the evaluation.

Patients without evidence of metastatic disease undergo endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS), which uses a high frequency ultrasound transducer to provide detailed images of esophageal masses and their relationship with the five-layered structure of the esophageal wall. EUS is the most accurate technique for locoregional staging of invasive esophageal cancer (including tumors arising at the EGJ), with an overall accuracy for tumor (T) and node (N) staging of 80 to 90 percent. EUS allows assessment of both perigastric and mediastinal lymph nodes, which can potentially be sampled during the evaluation with a fine needle aspiration biopsy if the result would impact treatment decisions.

The procedure involves full inspection of the peritoneal cavity to evaluate for peritoneal and liver metastases. The EGJ area can be visualized for tumor extension, and biopsies of lymph nodes in the gastrohepatic ligament and the celiac axis can be undertaken if necessary. Lavage may also be sent for peritoneal cytology. Opinion differs as to the optimal way to manage such patients. At some institutions, patients without overt intraperitoneal metastases but who have positive peritoneal washings are referred for neoadjuvant therapy and then restaged to determine whether they converted to negative cytology and are candidates for potentially curative surgery.

For example, only one trial, the German POET trial of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy versus induction chemotherapy alone, treated EGJ tumors as a separate entity. </p><p>Most of the data that inform the multimodality treatment of EGJ adenocarcinoma are derived from trials that involved predominantly gastric or esophageal cancers. Within the trials designed primarily for gastric cancer (which will be considered &quot;lower tract trials&quot; for the purpose of this review), patients with EGJ tumors have accounted for only about 20 percent of all enrollees [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/multimodality-approaches-to-potentially-resectable-esophagogastric-junction-and-gastric-cardia-adenocarcinomas/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. There are epidemiologic and pathobiologic differences between EGJ and non-cardia gastric adenocarcinomas that raise concern as to whether results from predominantly gastric cancer trials can be extrapolated to EGJ tumors.

Trials of multimodality therapy for esophageal cancer (which will be designated &quot;upper tract trials&quot; for this review) have included a larger percentage of patients with distal esophageal and EGJ adenocarcinomas, although the majority of distal esophageal tumors have been SCCs. While most clinical studies have not stratified outcomes according to histology, an increasing amount of evidence supports the view that SCCs differ from adenocarcinomas in terms of pathogenesis, epidemiology, tumor biology, and prognosis. Esophageal SCCs are strongly associated with alcohol and tobacco use while adenocarcinomas are associated with gastroesophageal reflux and high body mass.

However, many earlier landmark trials were conducted before the era of modern radiotherapy techniques such as three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). These modern techniques use CT scan for radiotherapy planning and offer dose-volume histogram of tumor volume as well as normal organs at risk such as lung, heart, and spinal cord. Thus, it is feasible to deliver an optimized RT that offers the maximum tumor response for a tolerable level of radiation dose. Thus, 3D conformal techniques should be used for modern treatment planning to minimize toxicities to adjacent vital organs. A standard dose of radiation for patients treated with concurrent chemotherapy is 50.4 Gy regardless of the specific chemotherapy regimen used.

If a new lesion is identified, biopsy must be performed before excluding a patient from surgical consideration given the high rate of false positive findings. (See <a href=\"#H5353223\" class=\"local\">'Use of PET and PET-CT during treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The surgical approach should be based upon anatomic tumor location. Minimally invasive techniques are increasingly utilized in esophageal and gastric surgery, and laparoscopy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> thoracoscopy are often utilized by experienced surgeons to avoid either laparotomy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> thoracotomy, respectively.
