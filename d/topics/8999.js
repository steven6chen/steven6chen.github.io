The upper GU tract consists of the kidneys and ureters, while the lower GU tract consists of the bladder, urethra, and external genitalia (penis, scrotum, testicles). Injury to the GU tract is overall uncommon, estimated to occur in &lt;1 percent of traffic accidents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inpatient-management-of-upper-genitourinary-tract-injuries-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Younger men (mean age approximately 30) are predominantly affected. The kidneys are the most commonly injured GU organ. While ureteral injury is very rare, when it occurs, it is usually associated with other severe injuries. </p><p>GU tract injuries, while typically not lethal, require clinical knowledge pertaining to each GU organ to avoid unwanted outcomes (eg, loss of renal function, urinary incontinence, difficulty voiding) and secondary psychosocial stressors. Coordination of care among urologists, <span class=\"nowrap\">general/trauma</span> surgeons, orthopedics, and other services can be essential to improve overall outcomes.</p><p>An overview of the management of upper GU tract injuries will be reviewed here. The management of upper GU tract injuries has evolved over the past decade, with an increasing level of importance directed to nonsurgical management, when clinically appropriate. </p><p>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-traumatic-lower-genitourinary-tract-injury\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of traumatic lower genitourinary tract injury&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H40571738\"><span class=\"h1\">MECHANISM OF INJURY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among genitourinary (GU) tract injuries, 43 percent involve the kidney, making it the most commonly injured GU organ [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inpatient-management-of-upper-genitourinary-tract-injuries-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Blunt kidney trauma is more common than penetrating injury (65 percent blunt versus 35 percent penetrating). For blunt etiologies, motor vehicle collisions (63 percent) are most common, followed by falls (43 percent), sports-related injuries (15 percent), and pedestrian injuries (4 percent). Firearms are the most common reason for penetrating GU injuries (65 percent), with the remaining injuries due to stab wounds [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inpatient-management-of-upper-genitourinary-tract-injuries-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. </p><p>Ureteral trauma is very rare and is thought to comprise &lt;1 percent of all GU trauma. Similar to most trauma demographics elsewhere, younger males predominate. Penetrating trauma is most common (77 percent), with gunshot wounds predominating [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inpatient-management-of-upper-genitourinary-tract-injuries-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The proximal ureter is most commonly involved. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H420304174\"><span class=\"h2\">Anatomy and associated injuries</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The kidneys are well protected in the retroperitoneum by the lower ribs, the back musculature, and the perinephric fat. Significant force is required to injure the kidney, and such forces also frequently result in injuries to surrounding viscera. Compared with penetrating kidney trauma, blunt kidney trauma is less frequently associated with concomitant abdominal injuries; however, with increasing renal injury grade, concomitant abdominal injuries become more prevalent following blunt injury. The most commonly associated injuries are to the liver and spleen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inpatient-management-of-upper-genitourinary-tract-injuries-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>The ureters (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F83477\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef83477 \">figure 1</a>) are also well protected within the retroperitoneum by visceral organs, psoas muscles, vertebrae, and the pelvis. The ureters course distally along the psoas muscles and enter the bladder posteriorly and inferiorly at the trigone. Anatomically, the right ureter is surrounded by the duodenum (anteriorly), inferior vena cava (medial), ascending colon (anterior), and pelvis (distally). The left ureter is surrounded by the descending colon (anteriorly), tail of pancreas <span class=\"nowrap\">(upper/medially),</span> and pelvis (distally). As a result of these close associations with these surrounding structures, ureteric injury is highly associated with concomitant injuries to these surrounding structures. In one of the largest reviews of ureteric trauma, associated injuries were present in 91 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inpatient-management-of-upper-genitourinary-tract-injuries-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Traumatic injuries to the small or large bowel were the most common associated injuries (96 percent). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4231704336\"><span class=\"h1\">TRAUMA EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We perform initial resuscitation, diagnostic evaluation, and management of the trauma patient with blunt or penetrating trauma based upon protocols from the Advanced Trauma Life Support (ATLS) program, established by the American College of Surgeons Committee on Trauma.

The FAST exam is useful in hemodynamically unstable patients to identify the immediate need for abdominal exploration. While the exam is useful in the emergency room to evaluate for hemoperitoneum, important renal injuries can be missed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inpatient-management-of-upper-genitourinary-tract-injuries-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], and it does not identify ureteral injury. </p><p>The initial approach to the evaluation of blunt and penetrating genitourinary (GU) tract injuries in the emergency department is presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=blunt-genitourinary-trauma-initial-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Blunt genitourinary trauma: Initial evaluation and management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=penetrating-trauma-of-the-upper-and-lower-genitourinary-tract-initial-evaluation-and-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Penetrating trauma of the upper and lower genitourinary tract: Initial evaluation and management&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Specific elements of the history, physical examination, and diagnostic evaluation that are relevant to the subsequent management of traumatic renal and ureteral injuries are presented below. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1078562998\"><span class=\"h2\">History and physical</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1732032588\"><span class=\"h3\">Suspicion for renal injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An appropriate mechanism of injury (eg, rapid deceleration injury, direct blow to the back or flank), hemodynamic instability, and presence of hematuria should increase suspicion for significant kidney trauma. Physical exam findings such as flank ecchymosis should alert treating providers to possible renal injury.</p><p>Knowledge of <span class=\"nowrap\">entry/exit</span> wounds following penetrating abdominal trauma is important to guide regions of the body that require subsequent imaging. Penetrating missiles entering at the anterior axillary line (eg, stab wound) are more likely to damage important renal structures like the renal hilum and pedicle. Those entering at the posterior axillary line will more likely involve the renal parenchyma. However, the trajectory and pathway of missiles is variable, and any gunshot wound to the abdomen, back, or flank can, but does not always, cause upper GU tract injury. Knowledge of bullet type (ie, hollow point, exploding, frangible), caliber, distance, and velocity can also be important for assessing potential damage. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2422362000\"><span class=\"h3\">Suspicion for ureteral injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Blunt ureteral injury is rare, but when it occurs, it can be difficult to identify. There are no signs that are pathognomonic for ureteral injury. Some patients will not have any external signs to suggest a ureter injury. As such, a high index of suspicion is necessary to identify the presence of ureteral injuries. Flank pain, gross hematuria, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> flank ecchymosis or posterior rib or spine fractures should increase suspicion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inpatient-management-of-upper-genitourinary-tract-injuries-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. </p><p>The mechanism of injury should guide the level of suspicion for ureteral injury (eg, rapid deceleration, multisystem abdominal trauma, penetrating trauma). Deceleration can result in avulsion of the ureter at the ureteropelvic junction or distally along the ureter. For penetrating trauma, a trajectory in proximity of the ureters may signal the need for additional evaluation even in the absence of other signs. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1821154547\"><span class=\"h2\">Detection of hematuria</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Detection of hematuria (particularly microhematuria) should be performed early in the trauma assessment since the administration of intravenous fluids can hemodilute the urine. </p><p>However, the degree of hematuria cannot predict the severity of kidney injury following blunt or penetrating trauma, highlighting the need for kidney imaging following abdominal trauma, especially penetrating injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inpatient-management-of-upper-genitourinary-tract-injuries-in-adults/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. Hematuria is more common following blunt kidney trauma than penetrating kidney trauma (88 percent blunt versus 56 percent penetrating). </p><p>Hematuria is an unreliable finding following ureteric trauma as it is present in less than one-half of patients with a ureteric injury. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H186268351\"><span class=\"h2\">Other laboratories</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are no other laboratories typically obtained during the initial trauma assessment that provide any indication of upper GU tract injury. A normally functional contralateral kidney can mask any changes in serum creatinine level that might serve as a harbinger for significant renal injury. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3246046141\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A definitive diagnosis of injury to the kidneys or ureters is typically made using contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scan of the <span class=\"nowrap\">abdomen/pelvis</span>. Additional radiographic imaging techniques may be useful during the course of conservative management or to aid intervention (minimally invasive, open surgical). For those with indications for immediate laparotomy, the diagnosis will necessarily be made during exploration. (See <a href=\"#H2976090085\" class=\"local\">'Damage control surgery'</a> below.)</p><p>Certain clinical features should prompt radiographic imaging for renal injury suspected on history and physical and the results of urinalysis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inpatient-management-of-upper-genitourinary-tract-injuries-in-adults/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Penetrating abdominal trauma. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blunt abdominal trauma and gross hematuria. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blunt abdominal trauma, microhematuria (&gt;5 red blood cells per high-power field), and hemodynamic instability (systolic blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>High index of suspicion for injury based on mechanism (eg, high-speed motor vehicle accidents, deceleration injury, multiple abdominal injuries, direct blow to the <span class=\"nowrap\">back/flank)</span>. Since approximately one-third of patients with deceleration injuries will not be associated with any degree of hematuria, all patients with this mechanism of injury should be imaged [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inpatient-management-of-upper-genitourinary-tract-injuries-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p/><p>The diagnosis of <span class=\"nowrap\">parenchymal/vascular</span> injuries and collecting system injuries requires different phases of CT imaging since the renal cortex and collecting system enhance at different timeframes. Three phases are recommended: the noncontrast phase, corticomedullary phase, and excretory phase. While the nephrogenic phase can be substituted for the late corticomedullary phase, it is not ideal. The corticomedullary phase occurs when the renal cortex is more brightly enhancing than the renal medulla to better enable parenchymal injury detection. This phase is also called the portal venous phase and provides simultaneous enhancement of the liver and spleen [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inpatient-management-of-upper-genitourinary-tract-injuries-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. A separate arteriovenous phase can enable diagnosis of a pseudoaneurysm or arteriovenous malformation; however, such diagnoses are uncommon, and this phase can be eliminated unless these are suspected. Elimination of the arterial phase helps reduce radiation exposure. When there is a concern for arterial injury, proceeding with diagnostic angiography should be performed in lieu of an arterial phase CT scan. When diagnostic angiography is performed following contrast-enhanced CT imaging, there is a risk for contrast-induced nephropathy, particularly in patients who are volume depleted. Contrast-induced nephropathy and its prevention are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-contrast-induced-nephropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis of contrast-induced nephropathy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-of-contrast-nephropathy-associated-with-angiography\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention of contrast nephropathy associated with angiography&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Findings on CT scan indicative of renal injury include subcapsular hematoma, perirenal hematoma, renal pelvis rupture, parenchymal laceration with or without collecting system injury, intravenous contrast extravasation from the renal artery or vein, or nonvisualization of a portion of or the entire kidney. </p><p>Identification of ureteral injuries requires a delay of 5 to 10 minutes after the administration of intravenous (IV) contrast to allow contrast to reach the ureters. When the situation allows, 10-minute delayed imaging is preferred for a more complete evaluation of the upper urinary tract. In an effort to reduce radiation exposure, delayed phase imaging can be performed with a low-dose protocol and increased axial image slice thickness (5 mm). Repeated scans at a later interval may be necessary if there is poor renal excretion of IV contrast at 10 minutes. </p><p>Findings that suggest ureteral injury include nonvisualization of the ureter, contrast extravasation from the ureter, ipsilateral hydronephrosis, and poor renal excretion localized to one side. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3099670490\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following trauma, upper genitourinary (GU) tract injury needs to be distinguished from lower GU tract injury (ie, bladder, urethra), particularly since both are associated with hematuria. Often the mechanism of injury or penetrating injury tract will aid with increasing or decreasing suspicion of one over the other. Imaging studies will identify the origin of the injury, though at times both the upper and lower GU tract may have suffered injury, more likely in association with pelvic fracture.

In a study from the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB) that spanned from 1994 to 2003, most renal injuries were low grade (55 percent grade I, 18 percent grade II). Intermediate (12 percent grade III) and high grade (10 percent grade IV and 5 percent grade V) comprised the remaining injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inpatient-management-of-upper-genitourinary-tract-injuries-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Grade I &ndash; Contusion: Microscopic or gross hematuria, urologic studies normal.

The grading system relies on visual inspection of the injury to make a diagnosis since injury grades are difficult to assess using imaging alone. Rather than stratifying ureteral injuries by grade, most surgeons distinguish them based upon location of ureteral injury (upper, mid, lower), mechanism of injury (blunt versus penetrating), and severity of injury (complete versus partial transection) as these categories guide the type of surgical management necessary for repair.

Whether to open the retroperitoneum (zone 2) and explore the kidney depends upon the mechanism of injury (blunt, penetrating), whether the hematoma is expanding, and the presence and severity of other injuries. Damage control surgery for the upper GU organs and the management of retroperitoneal hematoma are discussed briefly below and in more detail separately.

The absolute and relative indications for renal exploration are reviewed below. (See <a href=\"#H99143641\" class=\"local\">'Indications for renal exploration'</a> below.)</p><p>Conservative management is possible for the majority of blunt renal injuries predominantly due to improved patient stratification using computed tomography (CT) imaging as well as advances in angioembolization. Conservative management following penetrating trauma is less common; 63 to 70 percent of renal injuries require immediate surgical intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inpatient-management-of-upper-genitourinary-tract-injuries-in-adults/abstract/8,19,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,19,23</a>]. Conservative therapy is possible, though. In one of the largest series of penetrating gunshot-injured kidneys, none of the patients with renal injury grades I to III required intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inpatient-management-of-upper-genitourinary-tract-injuries-in-adults/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Delayed renal bleeding can occur following initial nonoperative management, as noted in one series. The rate of delayed bleeding was 24 percent following grade III and IV renal injuries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inpatient-management-of-upper-genitourinary-tract-injuries-in-adults/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. In such a situation, angioembolization or surgical care is recommended. </p><p>Conservative management of lower-grade renal injuries (grade I to III) is highly successful. A review of data from the National Trauma Data Bank (inpatient admissions only) noted that 97 percent of grade I, 94 percent of grade II, and 88 percent of grade III renal injuries were successfully managed nonoperatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/inpatient-management-of-upper-genitourinary-tract-injuries-in-adults/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. In a multivariate analysis, risk factors for failure of nonoperative management included gunshot wounds, highest abdominal American Association for the Surgery of Trauma (AAST) injury score, and highest renal AAST score. Among those who fail observation alone, the most common treatment involves angioembolization of a pseudoaneurysm, arteriovenous formation, or persistent bleeding from multiple grade III renal injuries. (See <a href=\"#H3494506151\" class=\"local\">'Angioembolization for bleeding'</a> below.)</p><p>Nonsurgical management is possible for high-grade (grade IV to V) renal injuries; however, minimally invasive techniques are needed more often to achieve renal salvage.

These authors had followed a strict protocol of a repeat contrast-enhanced CT scan for all patients with a grade IV to V renal injury to guide subsequent treatment. In a separate multicenter study that did not include a standardized protocol of repeat CT imaging, only 27 percent of nonoperative patients were treated using minimally invasive therapies.

The management of devascularization injuries is primarily conservative with revascularization reserved for selected indications (bilateral devascularization, devascularization of solitary kidney). Renal vascular injuries with active bleeding may be the source of hemodynamic stability and will necessitate exploratory laparotomy.

The kidneys are the most commonly injured GU organ. Ureteral trauma is very rare. Younger men are predominantly affected, and, while renal injuries are more commonly due to blunt trauma, most ureteral injuries are due to penetrating trauma. (See <a href=\"#H3817051373\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Renal injury is suggested by an appropriate mechanism of injury and gross hematuria or hemodynamic instability with any degree of hematuria. However, the degree of hematuria does not predict the severity of kidney injury. (See <a href=\"#H4231704336\" class=\"local\">'Trauma evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ureteral injury is also suggested by an appropriate mechanism and hematuria; however, hematuria is present in less than one-half of patients with a ureteral injury. Given a lack of defined presenting symptoms, clinicians should be mindful to assess for a potential ureteral injury when new symptoms of fever, flank pain, sepsis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> ileus occur following initial trauma stabilization. (See <a href=\"#H4231704336\" class=\"local\">'Trauma evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The typical contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) of the <span class=\"nowrap\">abdomen/pelvis</span> may not be adequate for the diagnosis of upper GU tract injuries. Identification of <span class=\"nowrap\">parenchymal/vascular,</span> collecting system, and ureteral injuries requires different phases of CT imaging (noncontrast phase, corticomedullary phase, and excretory phase) for optimal enhancement. (See <a href=\"#H3246046141\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The initial approach to the trauma patient depends on the clinical status of the patient, as well as the type and severity of injuries, which may mandate immediate laparotomy. Whether to open the retroperitoneum and explore the kidney and ureters depends upon the mechanism of injury (blunt, penetrating), whether the hematoma is expanding, and the presence and severity of other injuries. (See <a href=\"#H1818147353\" class=\"local\">'Approach to management'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-diagnosis-and-initial-management-of-traumatic-retroperitoneal-injury#H4032824384\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the diagnosis and initial management of traumatic retroperitoneal injury&quot;, section on 'When to explore retroperitoneal hematoma'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with indications for exploration (eg, hemodynamic instability, ongoing bleeding, urinoma): </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For blunt renal injury, only an expanding hematoma or one that has failed alternative methods of hemorrhage control should be opened and explored. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For penetrating renal injury, the kidneys should be explored if there is concern for injury (eg, active hemorrhage, expanding hematoma); some advocate for observation in selected situations. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Every effort should be made to salvage the kidney. Prior to considering nephrectomy, we manually palpate the contralateral kidney to confirm its viability. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Most ureteral injuries occur in the setting of concomitant injuries that often require exploratory laparotomy. Direct inspection of the ureters is the most sensitive method to assess for ureteral injury. Immediate repair is preferred, if possible, but drainage and delay of definitive management may be necessary, particularly in the setting of severe concomitant injuries.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients who are hemodynamically stable with blunt kidney trauma (all grades) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=EM%2F57943\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef57943 \">figure 2</a>), management is conservative, which is associated with higher rates of renal salvage compared with surgical exploration. Nonsurgical management is possible even for high-grade blunt injuries; however, angioembolization may be more often necessary to ensure successful management. Conservative management may be possible for hemodynamically stable patients with penetrating renal trauma with no injuries requiring exploration. (See <a href=\"#H1818147353\" class=\"local\">'Approach to management'</a> above and <a href=\"#H1020363233\" class=\"local\">'Conservative care'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bleeding from renal injury can usually be successfully treated with angioembolization, which can be repeated, if needed. If bleeding continues, surgical exploration may be necessary, and, sometimes, nephrectomy may become necessary. (See <a href=\"#H3494506151\" class=\"local\">'Angioembolization for bleeding'</a> above and <a href=\"#H99143641\" class=\"local\">'Indications for renal exploration'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ureteral injuries generally require some form of treatment, either using minimally invasive (stenting, tube drainage) or open reconstructive techniques. (See <a href=\"#H3446951862\" class=\"local\">'Treatment of ureteral injury'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3371248800\" class=\"local\">'Ureteral stenting for contusion/limited extravasation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2949342373\" class=\"local\">'Tube drainage for complex/missed injury'</a> above and <a href=\"#H553277325\" class=\"local\">'Surgical management of ureteral injury'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with deep lacerations due to renal injury (eg, American Association for the Surgery of Trauma [AAST] renal grade IV or V injury) who are being conservatively managed, we suggest repeat CT scan after 48 to 72 hours. Repeat CT imaging is also performed for clinical signs that suggest complications (eg, fever, increasing flank pain, persistent blood loss, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> abdominal distension). A low-dose &quot;CT urinoma&quot; study can reduce radiation exposure during repeat CT imaging.
