When such patients present with clinical features consistent with CS, they may also be referred to as having physiologic hypercortisolism or pseudo-CS.

However, cortisol hypersecretion, when present, is usually minimal. Furthermore, even severely depressed patients with substantial cortisol hypersecretion rarely develop clinical CS. However, some depressed patients may be difficult to distinguish clinically or biochemically from those with Cushing's disease. Their abnormal cortisol secretion presumably results from hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis hyperactivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/establishing-the-diagnosis-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], and disappears after remission of depression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/establishing-the-diagnosis-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].

Most had liver dysfunction, although the hormonal changes did not correlate closely with the degree of abnormality in liver function. In addition to liver dysfunction, these patients probably have transiently increased secretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH) or impaired hypothalamic or pituitary responsiveness to cortisol. However, their peripheral and petrosal sinus plasma CRH concentrations are normal, although these tests are not clinically indicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/establishing-the-diagnosis-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The hormonal abnormalities disappear rapidly during abstinence from alcohol.</p><p>Women with hypothalamic amenorrhea due to stress or weight loss also may have elevated UFC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/establishing-the-diagnosis-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], and male obligate exercisers have increased evening cortisol and ACTH levels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/establishing-the-diagnosis-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].

However, only the 15-minute sample was accurate, and a serum cortisol concentration &lt;1.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (38 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> two hours after the last dexamethasone dose had 90 percent sensitivity and 100 percent specificity without the administration of CRH.</p><p>Other studies of patients being evaluated for CS did not confirm the improved diagnostic accuracy of the CRH after <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> test when compared with the low-dose dexamethasone test alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/establishing-the-diagnosis-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/33-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-36</a>].

The two most important factors in obtaining a valid result are collection of a complete 24-hour specimen and a reliable reference laboratory. The former can usually be obtained by carefully explaining to the patient how to collect the specimen and by measuring urinary creatinine excretion (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=collection-of-a-24-hour-urine-specimen-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Collection of a 24-hour urine specimen (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>). Urinary cortisol assays are reviewed in detail separately.

Tests with a high likelihood ratio for a positive (abnormal) result indicate tests that help rule in CS, while those with a very low likelihood ratio for a negative (normal) result indicate tests that help rule it out. Salivary cortisol, UFC, and the overnight DST had similar accuracy. For urinary cortisol, they identified 14 studies including 646 patients with CS and 5226 patients who did not have CS. It reported a likelihood ratio of 10.6 (95% CI 5.5-20.5) for an abnormal result and a likelihood ratio for CS of 0.16 (95% CI 0.08-0.33) for a normal result. However, other studies suggest that in cases of mild CS, UFC has less diagnostic sensitivity than dose salivary cortisol [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/establishing-the-diagnosis-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/46,47\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,47</a>].

Saliva is easily collected, and cortisol is stable in saliva even at room temperature for several days. Saliva collection has the distinct advantage of being noninvasive and can be performed by the patient at home. It is especially useful for patients suspected of having cyclical or intermittent CS, who can collect many samples over an extended period of time and return the accumulated samples to the clinician at one time. As with other cortisol assays, it is useful to evaluate at least three samples from different days.</p><p>The criteria used to interpret salivary cortisol results differ among studies, perhaps because of assay or collection differences.

A single late-night serum cortisol concentration &gt;7.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (207 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L)</span> correctly identified 225 of 234 patients with CS; normal values were seen in all 23 patients with pseudo-CS (96 percent sensitivity, 100 percent specificity) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/establishing-the-diagnosis-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>].</p><p>This test has usually been performed in the hospital, and one group obtains the blood after the patient appears to be asleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/establishing-the-diagnosis-of-cushings-syndrome/abstract/65\" class=\"abstract_t\">65</a>]. However, sleeping versus awake results have not been evaluated systematically, and our experience is that the test can reliably be performed on an ambulatory basis. This can be done by inserting a heparin-lock earlier in the day to avoid stress-induced cortisol release caused by the anticipation of or pain caused by venipuncture, and asking the patient to return between 11 PM and midnight for blood drawing. We try to obtain samples on at least two evenings. Patients with intermediate values should be reevaluated after several weeks.
