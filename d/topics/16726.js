Many of the histologic changes that are seen can also occur in other inflammatory joint diseases and even in osteoarthritis. Thus, the diagnosis of RA is made by history and physical examination of the patient, and is supported by the presence of characteristic pathologic findings in synovial tissue. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-rheumatoid-arthritis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>There has been a resurgence of interest in the study of synovial tissue in RA over the past several years. Synovial tissue obtained at joint replacement surgery as well as needle and arthroscopic biopsy samples from patients with RA have been examined by molecular and immunohistochemical techniques in order to gain a better understanding of the pathogenic events in this disease. In addition, synovial biopsies are being used to assess the effects of medical interventions on the production of cytokines, joint-damaging enzymes, adhesion molecules, and other inflammatory mediators [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovial-pathology-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>An overview of the histologic features of normal synovium and the changes that are characteristic of RA is presented first, which is followed by a discussion of the synovial response to treatment.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">NORMAL SYNOVIUM</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The synovial tissue that lines the fibrous capsule of a joint is derived from cells of the embryonic mesenchyme [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovial-pathology-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Three types of subintima have been described: fibrous, adipose, and areolar [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovial-pathology-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>In the normal state, the synovium is a thin membrane that attaches to skeletal tissues at the bone-cartilage interface, and does not encroach upon the surface of articular cartilage. The synovial membrane is divided into two layers:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The synovial intima (also termed synovial lining cell layer) is the most superficial layer of the normal synovium, and is in contact with the joint cavity. It is normally composed of synovial lining cells (SLCs) arranged one to three cells thick. Although these cells form an epithelium-like unit, images obtained by transmission electron microscopy demonstrate that this is a discontinuous cellular layer without a basement membrane.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The SLCs are loosely attached to the subintima, which contains blood vessels, lymphatics, and nerves. Capillaries and arterioles are generally located directly deep to the SLCs; venules are located closer to the joint capsule. There is a continuous transition from loose to dense connective tissue as one goes from the joint cavity toward the capsule. Most cells in normal subintimal tissues are fibroblasts and some macrophages, although adipocytes and occasional lymphocytes and mast cells are present [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovial-pathology-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Synovial lining cells</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>SLCs are approximately 6 to 12 micrometers (microns) in diameter, excluding the numerous finger-like processes that extend from the main body. Classic electron microscopy studies have identified two populations of SLCs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovial-pathology-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The type A cell, or macrophage-like cell, contains vacuoles, a prominent Golgi apparatus, and filopodia, but little rough endoplasmic reticulum. These cells express numerous cell surface markers of the monocyte-macrophage lineage, including CD11b, CD68, and CD14 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovial-pathology-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Type A cells are phagocytic; in the normal joint, they may provide a mechanism by which particulate matter can be cleared from the joint cavity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The type B cell, or fibroblast-like synovial cell, contains fewer vacuoles and filopodia, and abundant protein synthetic organelles. These cells are responsible for the synthesis of extracellular matrix proteins of the synovium, including collagen. They also produce fibronectin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovial-pathology-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], synovial fluid <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyaluronate-derivatives-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hyaluronic acid</a>, and lubricin necessary for the normal motion of cartilage surfaces in the diarthrodial joint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovial-pathology-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Finally, type B SLCs synthesize plasminogen activator which may be involved in both the degradation of fibrinogen and the activation of metalloproteinase enzymes that have been implicated in joint destruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovial-pathology-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p>Direct interaction between type A and type B cells in the synovial lining later is suggested by the presence of ligand-receptor pairs on the surface of each cell type. Lining macrophage-like cells express CD97, a member of the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=secretin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">secretin</a> superfamily of transmembrane receptors; and lining fibroblast-like cells express CD55, or decay accelerating factor, a specific ligand for CD97 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovial-pathology-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Although the functional consequences of this ligand-receptor pair are unknown in synovium, it is noteworthy that CD55 protects cells from complement-mediated damage and it is likely that CD97 transduces signals in the macrophage. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=regulators-and-receptors-of-the-complement-system\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Regulators and receptors of the complement system&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Cytochemistry for uridine diphosphoglucose dehydrogenase (UDPGD) activity has been used to distinguish between the two types of cells; cells with high UDPGD activity are consistent with type B cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovial-pathology-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], while the expression of nonspecific esterase (NSE) activity is more typical of type A cells.</p><p>There is still no consensus regarding the origin of SLCs. Type A and B cells may represent cells of distinct origin and lineage, or may be phenotypic variants of the same cell type. The presence of an intermediate cell type, with electron microscopic features common to both type A and B cells, has been used as an argument in favor of the latter hypothesis. As will be described below, however, there is also evidence that these cells are of different origin.</p><p>The origin of SLCs is of some interest since they are major effector cells in the joint damage that occurs in RA (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Synovial pathology in rheumatoid arthritis'</a> below). Reservoirs of mesenchymal stem cells are present in the adult in sites including bone marrow, adult periosteum, and connective tissue in and around muscle [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovial-pathology-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The ability of mesenchymal cells to migrate and &quot;fill spaces&quot; is critical to wound repair in the adult, but there is no definite evidence at this time that these cells repopulate the synovial tissues in adults.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">SYNOVIAL PATHOLOGY IN RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As previously noted, the diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is clinical and cannot be made by examination of synovial tissue alone. Characteristic features of RA synovitis include (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F66931\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66931 \">picture 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypertrophy of the lining layer.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neo-angiogenesis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infiltration of immune cells of both the innate and adaptive immune system; immune cells can be found either randomly distributed within the synovial sublining or spatially grouped into follicular structures.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fibrin is often deposited on synovial surfaces, especially in clinically active disease.</p><p/><p>In a synovial biopsy study, designed to compare histologic features in knee joints and small joints of patients with RA, a comparable number of macrophages, T cells, and plasma cells were demonstrated in the sublining region of the rheumatoid synovium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovial-pathology-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Interestingly, numbers of Type A and Type B synovial lining layer cells in these samples did not show a significant correlation between different joints in the same patient.</p><p>RA synovitis is highly heterogeneous, with diverse cellular and molecular signatures (pathotypes) emerging as potential taxonomic classifiers of disease phenotypes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovial-pathology-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Diverse histomorphological features of RA synovitis are described as follicular, diffuse, and pauci-immune synovitis after staining with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) and by immunohistochemistry (IHC) for B cells (CD20), T cells (CD3), macrophages (CD68), and plasma cells (CD138) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovial-pathology-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/1,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,12</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Synovial lining cell hyperplasia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyperplasia of the synovial lining cell layer is a hallmark of RA. The lining cell layer may become 6 to 10 cells thick (versus the normal of one to three cells) and there is hypertrophy of individual cells.</p><p>Hyperplasia in established RA is primarily due to an increase in the number of type A cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovial-pathology-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Evidence for the recruitment of type A cells from the bone marrow comes from the study of radiation chimeras of normal and beige mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovial-pathology-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Beige mice carry giant secondary lysosomes in several cells, including those of the monocyte-macrophage lineage. Histocompatible normal mice were irradiated and bone marrow cells were grafted from beige mice. Giant granules were subsequently noted in 1 to 7 percent of synovial lining cells (SLCs), all of which had ultrastructural features of type A cells. The absence of these granules in type B cells argues against these cells being derived from type A cells in the normal joint.</p><p>Macrophage-like SLCs do not appear to be actively proliferating in the synovial lining. However, the degree to which in situ proliferation of type B cells contributes to the hyperplasia seen in the rheumatoid joint is a matter of debate. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), an auxiliary protein of DNA polymerase g, plays a critical role in DNA synthesis, and its presence correlates with other indices of cellular proliferation. The presence of PCNA in RA synovial lining cells has been used as evidence that in situ proliferation of fibroblast-like synoviocytes contributes to synovial lining hyperplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovial-pathology-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. On the other hand, immunostaining for Ki-67, a marker of cell proliferation, reveals absence of this marker in the synovial tissue of patients with RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovial-pathology-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>If in situ proliferation of type B cells is occurring, it may do so in episodic bursts. This could explain why few mitotic figures are present in the synovial lining layer in established RA.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Cellular infiltrate</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mononuclear cellular infiltrates are typically present in RA deep to the synovial lining layer. These infiltrates are comprised predominantly of macrophages and lymphocytes, which can form aggregates.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CD4+ T cells are present diffusely, in aggregates, and in perivascular sites.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CD4+, CD45RO+ differentiated memory T lymphocytes are common, especially in areas between aggregates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovial-pathology-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This phenotype is consistent with cells previously exposed to antigen (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-adaptive-cellular-immune-response#H16\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The adaptive cellular immune response&quot;, section on 'Memory T cells'</a>). Conditions in the synovial tissues may allow for an altered pool of peripheral blood T cells with limited diversity to act as proinflammatory cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovial-pathology-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CD8+ cells are present diffusely but are less prominent.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>B lymphocytes and immunoglobulin producing plasma cells are present within and between aggregates and in foci; many plasma cells produce rheumatoid factor.</p><p/><p>In a study to evaluate activated T cells, cell types were isolated from RA synovial tissues using mass cytometry, demonstrating an expanded population of programmed cell death (PD)-1<sup>hi</sup>CXCR5<sup>-</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovial-pathology-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Despite the high expression of PD-1, these cells did not have a phenotype of exhaustion; rather, they appeared to be a peripheral T-helper subset that produces cytokines that promote plasma cell differentiation and B-cell autoantibody production, suggesting they may be important to RA pathogenesis.</p><p>Most investigators find the CD4:CD8 ratio to be elevated in the synovium compared with peripheral blood, suggesting selective recruitment <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> proliferation of cells of the T-helper phenotype.</p><p>Multinucleated cells are sometimes present in the SLC layer and occasionally deep to the lining. These cells are of two types: macrophage polykaryons, and multinucleated cells with a fibroblast-like morphology. They are presumably formed by fusion of type A and type B SLCs, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovial-pathology-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Although common in RA, these cells can also be seen in other arthritides. The biological significance of these multinucleated cells and the factors involved in their generation are unknown. True multinucleated osteoclasts, however, are localized to the pannus-bone interface.</p><p>Other cells may also be seen in the synovium of patients with RA. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes are sometimes present, especially in acute disease flares. Natural killer (NK) cells and mast cells have also been identified; the latter may play a role in inflammation and in articular damage at the cartilage-pannus junction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovial-pathology-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adhesion molecules have well-defined functions in inflammation (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=leukocyte-endothelial-adhesion-in-the-pathogenesis-of-inflammation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Leukocyte-endothelial adhesion in the pathogenesis of inflammation&quot;</a>). These molecules are expressed on endothelium and in other synovial sites in patients with RA. Adhesion molecules play a role in the activation and recruitment to the joint of circulating mononuclear cells, consistent with the observed accumulation of mononuclear cells around blood vessels. Specialized venules with a columnar endothelium, similar to the &quot;high endothelial venules&quot; described in lymph nodes, are apparent morphologically and have been specifically implicated in mononuclear cell influx into synovium.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Relevant adhesion molecules include selectins, vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1), intercellular adhesion molecules-1 and -2 (ICAM-1 and ICAM-2), integrins, and others [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovial-pathology-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>]. Expression of VCAM-1 mRNA and protein is present in and on type B SLCs, and to a lesser extent on endothelium of small vessels beneath the lining layer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovial-pathology-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Dendritic cells have the ability to activate resting T lymphocytes. These cells are present in RA synovial tissues and fluid. The surface molecules CD80 (B7-1) and CD86 (B7-2) are costimulatory molecules required for effective antigen presentation. The presence of CD86 on dendritic cells within T cell clusters in RA implicates these cells as antigen-presenting cells within the rheumatoid joint [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovial-pathology-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Angiogenesis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The hypertrophied synovium is nourished by a plethora of blood vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovial-pathology-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. This growth of new blood vessels is thought to be important in the influx of inflammatory cells into the RA synovial tissue. It is also important in the growth of the RA pannus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Pannus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Destruction of cartilage and bone is a major source of morbidity in patients with established RA. The destructive process is mediated by a synovial membrane-derived tissue termed &quot;pannus&quot; (Latin for &quot;cloth&quot;). Pannus tissue adheres to the surface of articular cartilage, and cells within pannus produce proteinases, which degrade and destroy the extracellular matrix of the cartilage (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F66979\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef66979 \">picture 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovial-pathology-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Electron microscopic studies suggest that pannus results from synovial derived fibroblast-like cells migrating over the surface of cartilage. Deep to this fibroblast-like cell layer, ongoing destruction occurs via the invasion of cells with the electron microscopic appearance of macrophages [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovial-pathology-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p>The relationship of these macrophage-like cells to the fibroblast-like cells on the cartilage surface is unclear. Over time, blood vessels as well as other cell types migrate into the pannus. Eventually, the pannus is transformed into a fibrous tissue termed &quot;inactive&quot; pannus. One limitation of sampling synovial tissue via needle biopsy or arthroscopy is that these samples usually do not evaluate tissue at the cartilage-pannus junction.</p><p>Invasion of bone by pannus is mediated by osteoclasts leading to the characteristic marginal erosions observed radiographically in patients with RA. Destruction of cartilage and bone lead to joint instability, and eventually to fibrous ankylosis.</p><p>Multinucleated cells with the full phenotype of osteoclasts have been identified at the pannus-bone interface in bone resorption lacunae and are required for bone resorption in RA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovial-pathology-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>]. Synovial T-cells play an important role in osteoclastogenesis. A subset of T-cells expressing CD4 and receptor activator of nuclear factor (NF)- kappa B ligand (RANKL) cause peripheral blood mononuclear cells to differentiate into osteoclasts, an effect that is abrogated by osteoprotegerin (OPG), a soluble protein that binds to RANKL to prevent its biologic activity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovial-pathology-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

Much of what is known about the role of cytokines in RA comes from extensive studies of these proteins in serum and synovial fluid.

The chemokine receptors, CXCR3 and CCR5, are expressed by most T cells in the synovial fluid compared with a minority of T cells in the peripheral blood of subjects with RA, and virtually all T cells in rheumatoid synovial tissue express CXCR5. This phenotype suggests that lymphocytes are recruited to the synovium by a Th-1 type reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovial-pathology-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].

Perhaps the best studied are the family of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Cytokines known to be expressed in RA synovial tissues, including IL-1-beta, TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-17, and the JAK-STAT pathway are potent activators of these MMP genes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovial-pathology-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>].</p><p>MMP family members are divided into three categories based upon substrate specificity.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The collagenases cleave native collagen types I, II and III, the major collagens present in bone and cartilage, respectively.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The stromelysin group of enzymes has a broad substrate specificity, and stromelysin-1 (MMP-3) can degrade proteoglycans, gelatin, fibronectin, and laminin.

Larger numbers of synovial cells producing mRNA for MMP-1 and higher levels of active metalloproteinases in synovial tissue are associated with erosive disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovial-pathology-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/63,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">63,64</a>]. Gelatinases have also been identified in RA synovial tissues.</p><p>The tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases are naturally occurring proteins which bind in a 1:1 stoichiometry to various MMP family members, rendering them inactive. Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteases (TIMP)-1 and TIMP-2 have been identified in RA synovial tissues and are expressed in the synovial lining layer and in cells in the sublining [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovial-pathology-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/61,62,64\" class=\"abstract_t\">61,62,64</a>]. The balance between metalloproteinases and TIMPs is expected to determine the rate of extracellular matrix degradation. However, it is difficult to make a functional interpretation of the relative intensities of their detection in tissue samples. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cytokine-networks-in-rheumatic-diseases-implications-for-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cytokine networks in rheumatic diseases: Implications for therapy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Granzymes A and B are serine proteases present in activated natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic T cells. These enzymes are present in some synovial lymphocytes, particularly in NK cells in patients with RA and to a lesser extent in those with osteoarthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovial-pathology-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/65,66\" class=\"abstract_t\">65,66</a>]. The highest expression of granzyme B occurs in early RA; synovial tissue staining for granzyme B correlates with elevated serum levels of acute phase reactants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovial-pathology-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/66\" class=\"abstract_t\">66</a>].</p><p>Cathepsins B, D, K, L, and S are cysteine proteinases that have been identified in human rheumatoid and osteoarthritis synovium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovial-pathology-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/67-69\" class=\"abstract_t\">67-69</a>]. Cathepsin K can degrade collagen of both type I (bone) and type II (articular cartilage). An increased number of cathepsin K-producing cells are present in the synovium of patients with RA compared with those with osteoarthritis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovial-pathology-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>]. Cathepsin K is highly expressed in osteoclasts; patients with the osteosclerotic disorder, pycnodysostosis, lack activity of this enzyme [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovial-pathology-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. The presence of cells producing this enzyme at sites of erosion suggests a possible role in articular damage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Transcription factors and cell signaling molecules</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The primary control point for the production of the proteins that mediate inflammation (eg, cytokines, enzymes, and adhesion molecules) is at the level of gene transcription. This process is regulated by transcription factors which are proteins in the nucleus of the cell that bind to specific promoter regions of DNA. There is considerable interest in understanding the role of transcription factors in the pathogenesis of RA, especially since they are potential targets for therapeutic intervention. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-molecular-genetics#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of molecular genetics&quot;, section on 'RNA transcription'</a>.)</p><p>The AP-1 family of transcription factors (c-Jun, c-Fos, JunB, JunD, FosB, and Fra1, Fra2) activate the transcription of several genes relevant to synovitis, including the metalloproteinases collagenase and stromelysin.</p><p>The transcription factor nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kB) is a dimer, typically of p65 (RelA) and p50 (NF-kB1); like AP-1, these may be substituted with other family members (c-Rel, RelB). NF-kB is likely to be important for the expression of a number of cytokines found in rheumatoid synovium. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) has identified activated p65 and p50 in the nuclei of many deep and superficial cells in rheumatoid synovium, including endothelial cells (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F51926\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef51926 \">picture 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F73035\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef73035 \">picture 4</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovial-pathology-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/71,72\" class=\"abstract_t\">71,72</a>]. Using double IHC NF-kB within the synovial lining is localized predominantly, although not exclusively, in CD14-positive (macrophage-like) cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovial-pathology-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. This finding is in contrast to the distribution of AP-1 in fibroblast-like cells. The immunolocalization of TNF-alpha to CD14-positive SLCs in patients with RA may be attributed, at least in part, to the activity of NF-kB in these cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovial-pathology-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>Other molecules involved in the signaling pathways have been identified in synovium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovial-pathology-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>], including those of the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. Three major members of this pathway include ERK, jun kinase (JNK), and p38 MAPK, all of which are expressed in active form in RA synovial tissue [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovial-pathology-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/74,75\" class=\"abstract_t\">74,75</a>]. p38 inhibitors appear to work in a number of animal arthritis models [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovial-pathology-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>]. It may be that in the context of RA, shear stress, heat stress, cytokine stress, and oxidative stress activate these signaling pathways [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovial-pathology-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/77-79\" class=\"abstract_t\">77-79</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">SYNOVIAL TISSUE RESPONSE TO THERAPY AND CORRELATION WITH DISEASE ACTIVITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The advantage of synovial biopsy over measurements of peripheral blood to assess the response to therapeutic interventions was highlighted in a report of two patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treated with the monoclonal antibody <a href=\"topic.htm?path=alemtuzumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">alemtuzumab</a> (Campath-1H) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovial-pathology-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>]. The study subjects developed a prolonged depletion of circulating lymphocytes in response to the drug despite persistence of clinical synovitis. Synovial tissue analysis revealed significant T lymphocytic infiltrates at a time when circulating T lymphocytes were markedly depleted, suggesting that peripheral blood analysis may not accurately reflect the synovial tissue response to therapy. In contrast, synovial T cell depletion and reconstitution did correlate with changes in clinical disease activity in a series of seven patients who had synovial biopsies before and after autologous stem cell transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovial-pathology-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>].</p><p>Quantitative analysis of synovial tissue enables the response to a therapeutic intervention to be measured at the target organ.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Quantitative immunohistochemical analysis of sequential synovial biopsy specimens has been used to measure the response at four weeks to intravenous anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha monoclonal antibodies.

In a pilot clinical trial of N-[4-hydroxyphenyl] retinamide, however, there was no decrease in mRNA for metalloproteinases collagenase or stromelysin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovial-pathology-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>].</p><p/><p>Technical issues in methods of obtaining synovial tissues need to be considered in the interpretation of synovial biopsy studies. Variability and the representative nature of small synovial biopsies are important issues dictating that sampling be done in a controlled manner. The availability of small arthroscopes has facilitated the selection of biopsy sites under direct vision. One report found that multiple synovial samples taken from within a rheumatoid joint are histologically very similar, even when specimens are taken from maximally and minimally inflamed areas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovial-pathology-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. Another group has taken sequential arthroscopic biopsies from adjacent areas, in an attempt to reduce potential variability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovial-pathology-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/86,87\" class=\"abstract_t\">86,87</a>]. Using this method, intravenous <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> decreased the immunostaining for E-selectin and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) and TNF-alpha within 24 hours.</p><p>Samples from different joints (wrist or metacarpophalangeal versus knee) of the same patient taken at the same time show a good correlation between the numbers of sublining macrophages, T cells, and plasma cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovial-pathology-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Interestingly, numbers of Type A and Type B synovial lining layer cells in these samples did not show a significant correlation, suggesting that in biopsy studies, cells within the lining layer should not be used to assess therapeutic responses.</p><p>Correlations between synovial histology and clinical disease activity have been difficult to demonstrate. An important problem is the presence of overlap in the histologic findings in clinically normal and inflamed joints. One study, for example, found that normal synovium collected at arthroscopy from four healthy volunteers had perivascular and scattered lymphocytes, findings previously thought indicative of synovitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovial-pathology-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>].</p><p>In a study comparing early disease (RA of less than one year) and longstanding disease (RA of greater than five years), there was no change in immunohistological features with disease duration, although knee pain in the subjects correlated with macrophage numbers, interleukin (IL)-6, and TNF-alpha expression in the synovial biopsies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovial-pathology-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/89\" class=\"abstract_t\">89</a>]. Knee pain did not correlate with scores for CD4+ T cells.</p><p>The following studies illustrate the use of synovial biopsy as a tool to better understand RA pathogenesis and the response to therapy:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A study of 86 <span class=\"nowrap\">pre/post-TNF-inhibitor</span> arthroscopic biopsies (24 posttreatment repeats) demonstrated that ectopic lymphoid-like structures (ELS) were an independent negative predictor of response, whereas their regression was associated with good response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovial-pathology-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/90\" class=\"abstract_t\">90</a>]. In line with this, synovial transcripts associated with poor responses to TNF-inhibitors were found in samples expressing high levels by immunohistochemistry (IHC) of IL-7-R, normally associated with ELS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/synovial-pathology-in-rheumatoid-arthritis/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>].

In the normal state, the synovium is a thin membrane that attaches to skeletal tissues at the bone-cartilage interface and does not encroach upon the surface of articular cartilage. The synovial membrane is divided into two layers: the intima or synovial lining cell (SLC) layer, which is the more superficial layer; and the subintima, which contains primarily fibroblasts, macrophages, blood vessels, lymphatics, and nerves and which is adjacent to the joint capsule. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Normal synovium'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There are two types of SLC: the type A, macrophage-like cell, and the type B, fibroblast-like cell. These cells appear to directly interact and are major effector cells in the joint damage that occurs in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Mononuclear cellular infiltrates are typically present in RA deep to the synovial lining layer. These infiltrates are comprised predominantly of macrophages and lymphocytes, which can form aggregates. The hypertrophied synovium is nourished by a plethora of blood vessels, which is thought to be important in the influx of inflammatory cells into the RA synovial tissue and in the growth of the RA pannus, a synovial membrane-derived tissue which adheres to the surface of articular cartilage. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Synovial lining cells'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Synovial pathology in rheumatoid arthritis'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Synovial lining cell hyperplasia'</a> above and <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Cellular infiltrate'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Angiogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The destruction of cartilage and bone in RA is mediated at the interface between pannus and cartilage or bone; cells within pannus produce proteinases, which degrade and destroy cartilage. Invasion of bone by pannus is mediated by osteoclasts and results in the development of the characteristic marginal erosions observed radiographically in patients with RA. Destruction of cartilage and bone can lead to joint instability and, eventually, to fibrous ankylosis. Histologic changes in early RA include SLC hyperplasia, lymphocytic cellular infiltrates, and some polymorphonuclear leukocytes, as well as microvascular changes.
