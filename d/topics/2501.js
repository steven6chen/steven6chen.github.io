It is important for the healthy function of connective tissues such as bones, cartilage, and joints. However, in some cases, excess CPP builds up and forms microscopic &quot;crystals,&quot; which can deposit in tissues.</p><p>Crystals sometimes do not cause symptoms; this is called &quot;asymptomatic&quot; calcium pyrophosphate deposition (CPPD) disease. At other times, the crystals can cause acute or more chronic (long-term) inflammation or degeneration of involved tissues. Each of these outcomes of CPP crystal deposition is a part of the spectrum of CPPD disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3094426913\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF CPPD DISEASE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Calcium pyrophosphate deposition (CPPD) disease can present in a number of different ways:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Asymptomatic CPPD disease (in which the person has no symptoms, but crystals can be seen on imaging tests)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) crystal arthritis (formerly called &quot;pseudogout&quot;)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Chronic CPP crystal inflammatory arthritis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Osteoarthritis with CPPD</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Severe joint degeneration</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spinal involvement</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2891452298\"><span class=\"h1\">ACUTE CPP CRYSTAL ARTHRITIS (PSEUDOGOUT)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) crystal arthritis is a form of calcium pyrophosphate deposition (CPPD) disease and was the first type of CPPD to be widely recognized. It refers to sudden-onset attacks of joint pain, swelling, warmth, and difficulty using the affected joint. An attack can last for days or even weeks. The knee is affected in over 50 percent of patients with acute CPP crystal arthritis; however, the disorder can also affect the ankles, feet, shoulders, elbows, wrists, or hands.</p><p>This condition has also been called &quot;pseudogout&quot; because the symptoms of acute CPP crystal arthritis are very similar to those of gout, an arthritis caused by urate (sometimes referred to as uric acid) crystals rather than CPP crystals (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gout-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Gout (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>). Although the two disorders can cause similar symptoms, patients with pseudogout are treated somewhat differently than patients with gout. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'CPPD disease treatment'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">CPPD DISEASE RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Calcium pyrophosphate deposition (CPPD) disease symptoms develop in some (but not all) people in response to the deposition of calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) crystals in the joints. The crystals first develop in the joint cartilage and eventually move to the lining of the joint (also called the synovium) or into the joint fluid where they can cause inflammation with associated pain, swelling, and disability in the affected joint. In most people with CPPD disease, it is not known exactly why CPP crystals form and deposit in the joints, although abrupt shedding of crystals from deposits in cartilage is believed to promote acute inflammation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-calcium-pyrophosphate-crystal-deposition-cppd-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and etiology of calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition (CPPD) disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Some people, particularly older adults, have CPP crystals in their joints (called &quot;chondrocalcinosis&quot;) but never experience symptoms of acute arthritis. Chondrocalcinosis is present in up to 50 percent of people by age 90, often without or with only modest symptoms.</p><p>In addition to older age, there are several other factors that increase the risk of accumulating CPP crystals in the joints, including:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Joint trauma</strong> &ndash; People who have previously experienced a significant injury to or surgery on a joint have an increased risk of developing CPP crystal deposits.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Genetics</strong> &ndash; People can inherit a predisposition to CPP crystal deposition (called &quot;familial chondrocalcinosis&quot;); these people are more likely to develop acute CPP crystal arthritis or other features of CPPD disease earlier in life than patients with sporadic CPPD disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Excess iron</strong> &ndash; People with a genetic disorder called hemochromatosis, which causes the body to store excess iron, are at an increased risk of developing CPP crystal deposits. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hemochromatosis-hereditary-iron-overload-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Hemochromatosis (hereditary iron overload) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Other related disorders</strong> &ndash; Several other diseases of metabolism or endocrine glands are associated with CPPD disease. These include hyperparathyroidism (overactive parathyroid glands), hypophosphatasia (an inherited metabolic bone disorder), hypomagnesemia (low levels of magnesium in the blood), Gitelman syndrome (an inherited kidney disorder), and possibly others.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">CPPD DISEASE DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A health care clinician can confirm or rule out a diagnosis of calcium pyrophosphate deposition (CPPD) disease by performing an examination and tests. In many patients, a sample of joint fluid is obtained in order to determine whether calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPP) crystals are present in the fluid on microscopic examination and to exclude arthritis due to other causes, such as gout or joint infection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Synovial fluid analysis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Synovial (joint) fluid is obtained under sterile conditions through a needle inserted into the affected joint. The fluid is then analyzed to determine if crystals or infection are present. The presence of CPP crystals in a patient with joint pain and inflammation strongly supports a diagnosis of acute CPP crystal arthritis, while urate crystals are equally supportive of a diagnosis of acute gout.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Imaging</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A clinician may examine the painful joint(s) or other frequently involved joints by taking X-rays or doing other imaging tests. X-ray images can reveal calcium-containing crystal deposits in the cartilage, a condition known as chondrocalcinosis. Ultrasonography (ultrasound examination) of affected joints is another imaging method that is increasingly being used to establish or confirm the diagnosis of CPPD disease or to guide synovial fluid aspiration (a &quot;joint tap&quot;) to obtain material for synovial fluid analysis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">CPPD DISEASE COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Calcium pyrophosphate crystal deposition (CPPD) disease can lead to rapidly progressing osteoarthritis, caused by wearing down of the joint cartilage, bone cysts or spurs, and even fractures. These changes may occur in joints not usually involved in osteoarthritis, such as the knuckles and wrists.</p><p>Although treatment of episodes of acute CPP crystal arthritis can shorten the attack, treatment may not decrease the risk of developing a more chronic arthritis that in most ways resembles osteoarthritis. Treatment of this type of chronic arthritis is similar to that used for osteoarthritis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=osteoarthritis-treatment-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Osteoarthritis treatment (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">CPPD DISEASE TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no treatment that can completely remove or prevent the formation of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate (CPP) crystals. However, the joint pain and swelling generally resolve with treatment, including the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Joint aspiration <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> injection</strong> &ndash; A clinician may insert a needle into the affected joint to remove the fluid and crystals that have accumulated. This can help to relieve pressure and pain. An injection of glucocorticoids (steroids) into the joint may relieve the associated joint inflammation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Oral medications</strong> &ndash; Joint aspiration or injection is usually preferred when one or two joints are affected but may not be recommended if more than two joints are affected during an attack. In this case, an oral medication, such as a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID), oral glucocorticoid, or colchicine, may be preferred.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Taking an NSAID such as ibuprofen (sample brand names: Advil, Motrin), indomethacin (sample brand name: Indocin), or naproxen (sample brand names: Aleve, Naprosyn) can help to relieve symptoms of pain and inflammation. Prescription-strength tablets (as opposed to over-the-counter tablets) may make it more convenient to take the relatively high doses of NSAIDs that are needed to control an attack. Treatment of the acute attack of CPP crystal arthritis with oral antiinflammatory medications is usually continued only until the attack resolves. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Joint immobilization</strong> &ndash; Patients may be advised to avoid weight bearing (walking or running if the legs or feet are involved), avoid excessive movement, and limit activity for a period of time to minimize pain and swelling. In some cases, a temporary splint will be recommended to limit joint movement.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Treatment of related conditions</strong> &ndash; If the CPP crystal deposits are caused by a separate disorder (see <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'CPPD disease risk factors'</a> above), that condition may require treatment, although this may not affect the course of CPP crystal-related joint disease.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">CPPD DISEASE PREVENTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients who experience frequent episodes of acute calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) crystal arthritis, a clinician may prescribe daily colchicine (brand name: Colcrys). Use of this medication, which is also often used to treat or prevent gout, can reduce the number of acute attacks. The benefits and risks of preventive therapy should be discussed with a clinician.</p><p>The cost of prophylactic use of colchicine has been an issue for many patients and their clinicians. The availability of generic colchicine preparations may alleviate this concern, but the impact of this action remains uncertain. Programs are available to assist with the cost of colchicine for eligible patients; visit the <a href=\"http://www.needymeds.org/generic-drug/name/colchicine&amp;token=z5OPPpq3n9NrXoMoCWWOZWdjqv+pbmUhEFtVGBMdWPUZYHIqGbsVRK/n/lN5tpWEcr5jE2PhGvdogwkKngh/Ug==&amp;TOPIC_ID=509\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">NeedyMeds website</a> for more information.
