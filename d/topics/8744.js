More than 80 percent of lung cancers are classified as non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Although there have been significant advances in the treatment of subsets of patients with molecularly defined NSCLC (eg, epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR] mutant, ALK rearranged NSCLC), the prognosis in the majority of patients has improved only modestly. Clearly, a plateau has been reached with traditional chemotherapy, with minimal added benefit when chemotherapy is combined with the angiogenesis inhibitor, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bevacizumab-including-biosimilars-of-bevacizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bevacizumab</a>.</p><p>The emerging role of immunotherapy for advanced NSCLC using checkpoint inhibitors will be reviewed here. An overview of the current approach to treatment for advanced NSCLC is presented elsewhere.

The general principles and rationale of immunotherapy are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-cancer-immunotherapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of cancer immunotherapy&quot;</a>.) </p><p>Historically, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was considered to be non-immunogenic, that is, incapable of inducing immune tumor destruction. This was based in part on failed attempts to modulate the immune system in NSCLC patients with agents such as interleukin 2 (IL-2), interferon, and Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG). As a result of an improved understanding of the immune system and better technologies to facilitate drug development, newer immunotherapies that relieve suppression of anti-tumor immunity have emerged as powerful tools in the management of advanced NSCLC. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11313385\"><span class=\"h1\">IMMUNE ACTIVATION AND CHECKPOINT INHIBITION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several steps are required for the immune system to effectively attack tumor cells. These include tumor recognition, presentation of tumor antigen to T cells, T cell activation, and direct attack of tumor (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F90346\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90346 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Immune recognition is initiated by antigen presenting cells (APCs) such as dendritic cells that internalize and process tumor antigen onto major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, which are expressed on the surface of APCs. This process triggers expression of B7.1 and B7.2 on the APCs, which migrate to lymph nodes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Within the lymph node, the APC presents tumor antigen to resting T cells though interaction with the antigen-specific T cell receptor. If there is additional interaction between B7.1 or B7.2 and CD28 on the T cell, T cell activation occurs and the T cell leaves the lymph node.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When the activated T cell comes into contact with the tumor and recognizes antigen expressed on the tumor in association with MHC, it releases cytolytic enzymes (perforin and granzyme) and cytokines, which recruit other members of the immune system, and proliferates. The result is tumor destruction and creation of memory T cells. This is the same process utilized by the immune system in other pathogenic processes such as viral infections.</p><p/><p>Several immune checkpoints exist to dampen the immune response to protect against detrimental inflammation and autoimmunity. In the setting of malignancy, such immune checkpoints can be co-opted by tumors, leading to immune tolerance and subsequent progression of malignancy. Two well-characterized checkpoints being targeted in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) clinical trials are the cytotoxic T-lymphocyte antigen 4 (CTLA-4) and the programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F90346\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90346 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CTLA-4 primarily regulates early T cell activity and is upregulated on T cells after exposure to antigen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F90346\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90346 \">figure 1</a>). CTLA-4 competes with CD28 for binding to B7.1 and B7.2 with much higher affinity, delivering a negative signal to the T cell and blocking the co-stimulatory signal resulting from B7.<span class=\"nowrap\">1/2/CD28</span> interaction needed for T cell activation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>PD-1 inhibition occurs primarily at the site of the tumor, in contrast to CTLA-4, which functions largely in lymphoid organs. PD-1 is upregulated on activated T cells, and upon recognition of tumor via the T cell receptor, PD-1 engagement by programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) can lead to T cell inactivation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F90346\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90346 \">figure 1</a>). The primary mechanism of tumor PD-L1 expression is believed to be induction by inflammation in the tumor microenvironment, largely mediated by interferon gamma. Another possible mechanism is oncogene-driven-tumor PD-L1 tumor expression, regardless of tumor inflammation.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6950323\"><span class=\"h1\">ANTIBODIES TO PD-1 AND PD-L1</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The excitement about using immunotherapy to treat non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has been driven primarily by results from clinical studies evaluating antagonist antibodies to programmed death receptor 1 (PD-1) and programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), which have demonstrated prolonged tumor responses in patients with chemotherapy-refractory metastatic NSCLC.</p><p>Randomized trials in metastatic NSCLC evaluating both anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies are in progress, and other studies are investigating combination strategies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F103692\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef103692 \">table 1</a>). Additional efforts are ongoing to evaluate potential biomarkers of response to such therapy, in particular, expression of PD-L1 within the tumor. (See <a href=\"#H6779217\" class=\"local\">'Biomarker studies, tumor PD-L1 expression'</a> below.)</p><p>Distinct <span class=\"nowrap\">ligand/receptor</span> interactions need to be considered when evaluating antibodies to PD-1 and PD-L1 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F90357\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90357 \">figure 2</a>). These include binding of PD-1 by its two known ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, and binding of PD-L1 to B7.1, which can be additionally expressed on activated T cells. The latter interaction is also inhibitory, leading to T cell inactivation. Reverse signaling can also occur through PD-L1, inhibiting tumor cell apoptosis. Additionally, PD-1 and PD-L1 expression can be found on different types of immune cells, with varying effects if blocked.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H78287953\"><span class=\"h2\">PD-1 blocking antibodies</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11313410\"><span class=\"h3\">Nivolumab</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=nivolumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Nivolumab</a> is an IgG4 monoclonal antagonist antibody to PD-1 that is US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved for the treatment of patients with advanced squamous NSCLC and non-squamous cell NSCLC who experience progression of disease on or after standard platinum-based chemotherapy (regardless of tumor PD-L1 protein expression).
