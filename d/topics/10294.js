Another advantage of lidocaine over amiodarone and procainamide is its reported efficacy in the treatment of arrhythmias associated with the channelopathies or as a consequence of QT prolonging agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-evaluation-of-wide-qrs-complex-tachycardia-in-children/abstract/3-6\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><a href=\"topic.htm?path=lidocaine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">Lidocaine</a> is given with an initial bolus dose of 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> intravenously (IV) and this may be followed by an infusion of 20 to 50 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/kg</span> per minute. The bolus dose can be repeated if the infusion is initiated &gt;15 minutes after the initial bolus dose.

Severe adverse events related to IV lidocaine are uncommon; toxicity can include cardiovascular depression, drowsiness, disorientation, muscle twitching, and seizures.

Amiodarone causes hypotension due to an intrinsic vasorelaxant effect and secondary to histamine release from the formulation that contains the solvent polysorbate 80.

The VT associated with ARVC is usually due to reentry and does not respond to vagal maneuvers or adenosine more likely to respond to cardioversion or pace-termination.

Electromechanical dyssynchrony with an underlying activation delay due to bundle branch block or in the setting of chronic ventricular pacing is the target for CRT therapy. In adult patients with systolic heart failure, CRT can lead to restoration of normal or near normal electromechanical activation, improve myocardial efficiency, and reverse structural and cellular remodeling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/management-and-evaluation-of-wide-qrs-complex-tachycardia-in-children/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

These retrospective studies and case series involve the heterogeneous CHD population and were not randomized; thus, it is difficult to assess the impact of CRT on outcomes.
