The World Health Organization (WHO) classification of tumors of the CNS recognizes more than 100 tumors in 17 different categories [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The most common of these include the diffuse gliomas and meningiomas, as well as metastatic lesions from extracranial tumors. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-pathologic-diagnosis-of-gliomas\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and pathologic diagnosis of gliomas&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The clinical manifestations of brain tumors are determined by the anatomic location, rate of growth, and histology of the specific tumor. Although symptoms, imaging characteristics, and demographic features may suggest a specific tumor type, definitive diagnosis requires biopsy and in many instances, molecular studies for confirmation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-brain-tumors-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the clinical features and diagnosis of brain tumors in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For the rare brain tumors reviewed here, information about the clinical and imaging manifestations, natural history, and management is based on case reports and small series. Our recommendations regarding treatment are necessarily extrapolated from these limited data and the general principles of brain tumor management. More detailed discussions of other tumor types are presented separately.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">NEURONAL AND MIXED NEURONAL-GLIAL TUMORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Neuronal and mixed neuronal-glial tumors are characterized by a variable degree of neuronal and glial differentiation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F109517\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef109517 \">table 1</a>). Tumors in this category include dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor, gangliogliomas and gangliocytomas, dysplastic gangliocytoma of the cerebellum (Lhermitte-Duclos disease), desmoplastic infantile <span class=\"nowrap\">astrocytoma/ganglioglioma,</span> papillary glioneuronal tumor, rosette-forming glioneuronal tumor, diffuse leptomeningeal glioneuronal tumor, cerebellar liponeurocytomas, central and extraventricular neurocytomas, and paragangliomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H309922048\"><span class=\"h2\">Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumors (DNTs or DNETs) are benign, supratentorial tumors. They typically occur in children and young adults with a long-standing history of intractable focal epilepsy. Patients with DNTs generally have minimal or no neurological signs other than seizures, and they generally have normal intelligence.</p><p>Key pathologic features of DNTs include the presence of entrapped cortical neurons, foci of dysplastic cortical organization, a multinodular architecture with components resembling astrocytoma or oligodendroglioma, and a columnar structure oriented perpendicular to the cortical surface. DNTs must be distinguished from diffuse gliomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. The majority of tumors express S100 and OLIG2. CD34 expression is variable. Approximately 30 percent of DNTs harbor the <em>BRAF</em> V600E mutation. Neither isocitrate dehydrogenase (<em>IDH</em>) 1 nor <em>IDH2 </em>mutations are consistent with DNT, and presence of either suggests a diffuse glioma, as does co-deletion of 1p and 19q [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>On magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), DNTs are T1-weighted hypointense and T2-weighted hyperintense. The lesions are based in and focally expand the cortex, sometimes extending into the white matter. Gadolinium enhancement is variable, occurring in less than one-half of cases; enhancement is patchy and multifocal rather than diffuse [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. There is sometimes skull molding adjacent to the lesions due to slow tumor growth.</p><p>Surgery is indicated for refractory seizures, but lesions in eloquent cortex are best observed, if possible. Most patients are seizure-free at least initially following surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, the incidence of seizures appears to increase with longer duration of follow-up. This was illustrated by a series of 26 children, in which 62 percent remained seizure-free at a median follow-up of 4.3 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The main risk factors for recurrent seizures were age &gt;10 years and longer duration of epilepsy (&gt;2 years) prior surgery. Rarely, tumor recurrence or even malignant transformation may occur [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Ganglioglioma and gangliocytoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Gangliogliomas and gangliocytomas comprise a spectrum of low-grade tumors characterized by a dysplastic neuronal population. In gangliogliomas, the dysplastic neuronal cells are accompanied by neoplastic glial cells, while in gangliocytomas, large, well-differentiated neurons are the sole neoplastic component. </p><p>Although these tumors may arise anywhere in the neuraxis, most are supratentorial and located in the temporal lobes. Up to 60 percent of gangliogliomas harbor a <em>BRAF</em> V600E mutation, which has been associated with higher risk for recurrence after standard therapy in pediatric low-grade gliomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/8-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-10</a>]. The mutated protein is found primarily in the neuronal cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Midline, low-grade gangliogliomas may harbor both the <em>H3F3A</em> mutation and <em>BRAF</em> V600E in both the glial and neuronal components [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Mutations in <em>IDH1</em>, when found in tumors histologically identified as gangliogliomas, strongly support the alternate diagnosis of diffuse glioma and are associated with an older age at diagnosis, a greater risk of recurrence, and a poorer prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/1,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-pathologic-diagnosis-of-gliomas#H2243056697\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and pathologic diagnosis of gliomas&quot;, section on 'IDH1/IDH2 mutations'</a>.)</p><p>Gangliogliomas and gangliocytomas typically occur in children and young adults; the average age in most series is approximately 20 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/13-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-16</a>]. Seizures are the most common presenting symptom, and long-standing epilepsy is frequent. Gangliogliomas can be an incidental finding when temporal lobectomies are performed to treat epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>On MRI, these tumors are hyperintense on T2-weighted images [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. One-half of cases have cysts, and approximately one-third have calcifications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Contrast enhancement varies from none to marked and may be solid or rim-enhancing. </p><p>The initial management is surgical resection. While gross total resection is optimal, the prognosis is good even after subtotal resection. Late recurrences can occur in either case. This was illustrated by a series of 62 adult patients with low-grade ganglioglioma, in which the five-year progression-free survival was 78 percent after gross total resection and 62 percent after subtotal resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Time to progression ranged from 2 months to 20 years and was significantly shorter in patients older than 40 years at the time of diagnosis (14 versus 3 years).</p><p>Although fewer than 10 percent of gangliogliomas become anaplastic, the presence of anaplasia in gangliogliomas is ominous. Despite aggressive management with radiation and chemotherapy, anaplastic gangliogliomas are usually fatal. The therapeutic implications of a <em>BRAF</em> V600E mutation are an area of active investigation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/10,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,21,22</a>]. </p><p>Radiation therapy is not recommended for patients who have had a complete resection. Despite concerns that radiation therapy may contribute to transformation to a more anaplastic tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>], a retrospective review of the literature suggests that radiation therapy after subtotal resection improves local tumor control in both low- and high-grade gangliogliomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. However, no effect on overall survival was demonstrated. These data are insufficient to make a firm recommendation about the role of radiation therapy after subtotal resection of low-grade ganglioglioma. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Dysplastic cerebellar gangliocytoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dysplastic cerebellar gangliocytoma, also known as Lhermitte-Duclos disease, is an extremely rare entity characterized by loss of normal cerebellar cortical architecture and focal thickening of the folia. It is not yet clear whether dysplastic cerebellar gangliocytoma is a neoplastic or hamartomatous tumor of the cerebellar cortex; if neoplastic, it corresponds to WHO grade I. Histologically, there is reduced cerebellar white matter and presence of abnormal hypertrophic ganglion cells that superficially resemble Purkinje cells. </p><p>Dysplastic gangliocytoma of the cerebellum is typically seen in young and middle-aged adults, although the disease has been diagnosed in patients as young as 3 years and as old as 70 years. Cerebellar symptoms may be present for a number of years prior to establishing the diagnosis, and obstructive hydrocephalus is common. The lesion arises in the cerebellar hemispheres, with rare extension into the vermis. An association with developmental abnormalities including macrocephaly and mental retardation is not uncommon.</p><p>Dysplastic gangliocytoma of the cerebellum can be familial or sporadic. Molecular studies in patients with dysplastic gangliocytoma of the cerebellum suggest a high frequency of abnormalities in the <span class=\"nowrap\">PTEN/AKT</span> pathway, a major regulator of cell growth [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. As such, this tumor has been linked to Cowden syndrome, an autosomal dominantly inherited condition characterized by multiple hamartomatous growths, an increased incidence of breast, uterine, and thyroid cancer, and germline mutations in the PTEN (phosphatase and tensin homolog) gene. </p><p>Most adults, but not children, with dysplastic gangliocytoma have PTEN germline mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. The Ohio State University revised clinical diagnostic criteria includes dysplastic gangliocytoma of the cerebellum as a major criterion for Cowden syndrome, and the National Comprehensive Cancer Network considers its presence to be an indication for genetic testing for Cowden syndrome (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F72070\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72070 \">table 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pten-hamartoma-tumor-syndrome-including-cowden-syndrome#H462459902\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome, including Cowden syndrome&quot;, section on 'Cowden syndrome'</a>.)</p><p>On MRI, dysplastic cerebellar gangliocytoma is characterized by enlarged cerebellar folia with distorted architecture and variable cystic change. The lesion is typically nonenhancing, T1 hypointense, and T2 images are characterized by a laminar pattern of alternating high and low signal. The mass is well circumscribed and distinct from the surrounding tissue. In rare cases it enhances with contrast, which may represent venous proliferation in the outer portions of the cerebellar cortex and prominent draining veins [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/27-29\" class=\"abstract_t\">27-29</a>].</p><p>Treatment of dysplastic gangliocytoma of the cerebellum is surgical resection; a few reported cases have recurred after apparent gross total resection. Inhibition of the <span class=\"nowrap\">PTEN/AKT/PI3K</span> pathway with rapamycin was effective in one case of an infant with severe, symptomatic bilateral dysplastic gangliocytoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Because of the association with Cowden syndrome in adults, clinicians should exclude concomitant malignancies (particularly breast and genitourinary cancers) and refer patients for genetic testing for Cowden syndrome [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/25,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,31</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hereditary-breast-and-ovarian-cancer-syndromes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndromes&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Desmoplastic infantile astrocytoma/ganglioglioma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Desmoplastic infantile astrocytoma and desmoplastic infantile ganglioglioma were initially thought to occur only in the first two years of life but have subsequently been reported in patients as old as 25 years of age. Typical features include dual astrocytic and ganglionic differentiation, prominent desmoplastic stroma, very large size, location in the cerebral hemispheres, presence of solid and cystic components, distinct hypointensity on T2-weighted MRI, and favorable prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Rare cases with <em>BRAF</em> V600E mutations have been described [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Treatment consists of surgery, with chemotherapy in cases of incomplete resection. Most studies indicate that gross total resection results in long-term survival. Radiation therapy is usually considered only when other options have been exhausted.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1183552130\"><span class=\"h2\">Papillary glioneuronal tumor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Papillary glioneuronal tumors are rare low-grade tumors that occur primarily in young adults, with a median age at diagnosis of 23 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/1,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,33</a>]. Characteristic features of these tumors include their location in the cerebral hemispheres, combined astrocytic and neuronal differentiation, and a distinctive pseudopapillary architectural pattern. <em>SLC44A1</em>-<em>PRKC</em> fusions occur in these tumors with resultant mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling dysregulation; while the numbers are low, this fusion might emerge as a specific disease characteristic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>].</p><p>MRI features are similar to other neuronal-glial tumors. Most lesions have cystic and enhancing, solid components that are iso- to hyperintense on T2-weighted images. Calcification may also be observed. In most cases, papillary glioneuronal tumors are curable by surgical resection. Rare recurrent or progressive papillary glioneuronal tumors have been reported, typically in association with an elevated Ki-67 index (&gt;5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H745613932\"><span class=\"h2\">Rosette-forming glioneuronal tumor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rosette-forming glioneuronal tumors are rare, slow-growing lesions primarily affecting young adults. They usually occur in the fourth ventricle but can also be seen in the pineal region, optic chiasm, spinal cord, and septum pellucidum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. &#160;</p><p>The defining histopathological feature is a mixed population of neurocytes organized in pseudorosettes and pilocytic astrocytes. Unlike pilocytic astrocytomas, rosette-forming glioneuronal tumors do not harbor alterations in <em>BRAF</em>; some harbor mutations in <em>PIK3CA</em> or <em>FGFR1 </em>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/36,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">36,37</a>]. </p><p>Tumors in the fourth ventricle typically present with hydrocephalus and therefore headaches. On MRI scans, they are heterogeneous, cystic, or multiloculated with enhancing areas. In some cases, they invade cerebellar or brainstem parenchyma. These tumors appear to be curable by surgical resection in the majority of cases, although rare cases of tumor dissemination throughout the ventricular system have been described.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2106148917\"><span class=\"h2\">Diffuse leptomeningeal glioneuronal tumor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Diffuse leptomeningeal glioneuronal tumor is a newly designated tumor as of the 2016 revision of the WHO classification system for central nervous system (CNS) tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Historical reports have used other names for this tumor, including primary leptomeningeal oligodendrogliomatosis and disseminated oligodendroglioma-like leptomeningeal neoplasm. Defining features are predominant and widespread leptomeningeal growth, an oligodendroglial-like cytology, and evidence of neuronal differentiation in a subset of cases. In addition, most tumors have concurrent <em>BRAF</em>-<em>KIAA1549</em> gene fusion and either 1p deletion or <span class=\"nowrap\">1p/19q-codeletion</span> in the absence of mutations in IDH.</p><p>Based on the largest published series of 36 patients, the median age at diagnosis is five years (range 5 months to 45 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Most patients present acutely with signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure due to hydrocephalus, cranial neuropathies, and other leptomeningeal signs.</p><p>MRI shows widespread leptomeningeal enhancement and thickening, often most prominent along the spinal cord, posterior fossa, and brainstem. Intraparenchymal and intramedullary enhancing nodules can also be seen. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology is often negative despite high protein levels, and diagnosis usually requires meningeal biopsy. Histopathologically, tumor cells usually have low-grade features but a WHO grade has not yet been assigned.</p><p>Optimal treatment is unknown, and these tumors can have a relatively indolent course. Due to the young age at which many patients are diagnosed, chemotherapy is often attempted before radiation. In a series of 36 patients with a median follow up of five years, median survival was not yet reached; of the nine patients who died, survival ranged from less than a year to 21 years after first biopsy (median three years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Mitotic activity, Ki67 &gt;4 percent, and microvascular proliferation were associated with worse survival.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Central and extraventricular neurocytoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Central neurocytomas are well-differentiated tumors that constitute approximately one-half of all intraventricular lesions in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. Similar tumors have occasionally been identified in the brain parenchyma or spinal cord, in which case they are referred to as extraventricular neurocytomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/1,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,40</a>]. Despite their usual intraventricular location, leptomeningeal dissemination is extremely rare [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. </p><p>Central neurocytomas are considered neuroectodermal tumors with predominant neuronal differentiation. They characteristically stain diffusely positive for synaptophysin, and most are immunoreactive for NeuN. Genetic studies conducted on 20 typical central neurocytomas identified overexpression of MYCN, PTEN, and OR5BF1, and underrepresentation of BIN1, SNRPN, and HRAS, suggesting that MCYN overexpression and reduced expression of the tumor suppressor BIN1 may contribute to tumor development [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. A study of seven extraventricular neurocytomas found an absence of <span class=\"nowrap\">IDH1/IDH2</span> mutations and MGMT promotor methylation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. </p><p>The mean age at diagnosis in patients with central neurocytoma is 29 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. Most patients present with symptoms of increased intracranial pressure due to hydrocephalus. Visual disturbances and impaired cognitive function may also be present. Focal neurologic deficits are uncommon. A few patients have presented with intraventricular hemorrhage.</p><p>Most central neurocytomas are multicystic and calcified, with a broad based attachment to the superolateral wall of the ventricle. They are typically found in the lateral or third ventricle, attached to the septum pellucidum or ventricular wall at the foramen of Monro. They do not usually occur in the occipital or temporal horns.</p><p>The typical computed tomography (CT) appearance is that of a heterogeneous, hyperintense intraventricular mass, with moderate contrast enhancement. On MRI, they are slightly hyperintense on T1- weighted images; the appearance on T2-weighted images is somewhat more variable. They usually enhance with gadolinium. Both central and extraventricular neurocytomas may be difficult to distinguish from more common lesions like high-grade gliomas on MRI [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>].</p><p>The optimal treatment is complete surgical resection. Even subtotal resection may be associated with prolonged survival, since these tumors usually regrow slowly. The prognosis appears to be better in patients with typical neurocytomas (ie, a growth fraction &lt;3 percent, as measured by the MIB-1 monoclonal antibody) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/47-49\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-49</a>], and adjuvant radiation therapy or stereotactic radiosurgery may be useful for patients with an incomplete resection or atypical histology [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/50,51\" class=\"abstract_t\">50,51</a>]. Recurrent or progressive tumors are typically treated with focal radiation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. At least one report suggests that recurrent central neurocytomas may be responsive to systemic chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>The outcomes and prognostic factors associated with the treatment of central neurocytoma are illustrated by the results of treatment in a retrospective series of 45 patients treated over a 35-year period using surgery, radiation therapy, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. The 10-year survival and local control rates were better for those with typical neurocytomas compared with atypical lesions (90 versus 63 percent and 74 versus 46 percent, respectively). Postoperative radiation therapy improved local control at 10 years (75 versus 51 percent without postoperative radiation therapy), but this did not translate into an overall survival benefit. A multicenter study of 71 cases, which included an immunohistochemical assessment of tumors, found that extent of surgery was the sole prognostic marker. However, the study may have had an insufficient number of cases to identify a MIB-1index prognostic threshold [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2576147850\"><span class=\"h2\">Cerebellar liponeurocytoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cerebellar liponeurocytomas are posterior fossa tumors, with an average age at diagnosis of approximately 50 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Tumors contain mature adipose tissue and various other cell types, including some degree of neuronal differentiation. Gene profiling has provided evidence that cerebellar liponeurocytomas are a distinct clinical entity, more closely related to neurocytoma than to medulloblastoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Overexpression of fatty acid binding protein 4 (FAB4) may help distinguish these tumors from medulloblastoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p>CT demonstrates well-demarcated lesions that are hypo- or isodense and have moderate heterogeneous enhancement. MRI demonstrates T1 hypointensity of the tumor, heterogeneous T2 hyperintensity, and heterogeneous enhancement with gadolinium.</p><p>Only approximately 40 cases have been reported, and the optimal treatment and the overall prognosis are difficult to estimate. Cerebellar liponeurocytomas appear to have a relatively protracted natural history [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/57,58\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,58</a>]. On this basis, management with surgery has been recommended, with additional surgery or radiation therapy if disease recurs.

Tumors arising in the choroid plexus are distributed in proportion to the density of this tissue, with 50 percent occurring in the lateral ventricle, 40 percent in the fourth ventricle, 5 percent in the third ventricle, and 5 percent multifocal. These tumors rarely occur in extraventricular locations, presumably due to a residual nest of embryonic tissue.</p><p>Choroid plexus tumors account for less than one percent of all intracranial tumors; in children under age one year, they account for 10 to 15 percent of intracranial tumors. Choroid plexus papillomas are benign and account for about 80 percent of these tumors.</p><p>Headache is the most common symptom of choroid plexus tumors, reflecting increased intracranial pressure. Hydrocephalus can occur due to increased CSF production, obstruction of CSF flow, or subclinical bleeding that blocks CSF absorption by arachnoid granulations.</p><p>The median age at diagnosis is three years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>]. Age at presentation correlates with the location of the tumor. Lateral ventricle tumors are more common in children less than 10 years old, while the fourth ventricle tumors are distributed evenly up to age 50 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/69\" class=\"abstract_t\">69</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h2\">Choroid plexus papilloma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Choroid plexus papillomas histologically resemble normal choroid plexus and probably represent local hamartomatous overgrowths. They are classified as World Health Organization (WHO) grade I neoplasms. Tumors with increased mitotic activity (&ge;2 mitoses per high-power field) are classified as atypical choroid plexus papillomas (WHO grade II).</p><p>On computed tomography (CT) scan, choroid plexus papillomas are often calcified and enhance with contrast; they may be difficult to differentiate from ependymomas, although the latter do not typically have significant calcification. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may reveal flow voids, reflecting tumor vascularity. The parts of the choroid plexus papillomas that are not calcified are hypo- to isointense compared with parenchyma on T1-weighted and hyperintense on T2-weighted imaging. Magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) may demonstrate enlarged choroidal arteries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]. There are no MRI features that distinguish grade I from grade II papillomas.</p><p>Histologically, choroid plexus papillomas contain a uniform cell population, without significant cytological atypia. The growth fraction (MIB-1) is less than 2 percent for grade I tumors. Most exhibit apical microvilli and scatted cilia, which exhibit a microtubule configuration characteristic of neuroepithelial cells. Atypical choroid plexus papillomas are distinguished from grade I tumors primarily by a higher mitotic rate (&ge;2 mitoses per high-power field) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Treatment for large or symptomatic choroid plexus papillomas is resection; small, asymptomatic suspected papillomas can be monitored conservatively without any treatment and only intervened upon if they enlarge. After complete resection, these tumors seldom recur. Even subtotally resected tumors usually have a benign course, although malignant transformation to choroid plexus carcinoma has been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. Adjuvant radiation therapy is not indicated but may be useful for recurrent tumors that are inoperable. Leptomeningeal seeding may occur with histologically benign tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].</p><p>The results of treatment are illustrated by a meta-analysis that included 353 patients with choroid plexus papillomas.

Two patients had recurrence requiring re-resection and adjuvant therapy.</p><p>Atypical choroid plexus papillomas recur at higher rates; in a series of 92 patients, the five-year event-free survival rate was 92 percent in patients with grade I tumors compared with 83 percent in patients with grade II tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Choroid plexus carcinoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Choroid plexus carcinomas are aggressive tumors characterized by dense cellularity, mitoses, nuclear pleomorphism, focal necrosis, loss of papillary architecture, and invasion of neural tissue. There may be extraventricular extension into brain parenchyma.</p><p>On imaging, choroid plexus carcinomas are more heterogeneous than choroid plexus papillomas, due to areas of necrosis and parenchymal invasion. T2 signal abnormality maybe present in the surrounding white matter, suggesting vasogenic edema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. The differential diagnosis includes metastatic adenocarcinoma (especially in adults), teratoma (especially in young male patients), and medulloepithelioma (especially in infants). The presence of multifocal areas of tumor with normal-appearing choroid plexus is more likely to be metastatic disease rather than choroid plexus carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].</p><p>Choroid plexus carcinoma can be a manifestation of Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), which is due to mutations in the <em>TP53</em> tumor suppressor gene. In a multi-institution study of 64 patients with either choroid plexus papillomas or carcinomas, germline mutations of <em>TP53</em> were present in all cases of carcinoma in which LFS was diagnosed based upon clinical criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/77\" class=\"abstract_t\">77</a>]. In contrast, such germline mutations were absent in all those without LFS. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=li-fraumeni-syndrome\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Li-Fraumeni syndrome&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The invasiveness of choroid plexus carcinomas typically precludes gross total surgical resection. Prognosis is poor, with a median survival of approximately 2.5 to 3 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/68,78\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,78</a>].

There are no randomized trials assessing the role of chemotherapy or radiation therapy following surgical resection.

A meta-analysis that included 347 patients with choroid plexus carcinoma reported in the literature observed improved survival rate among those given multiagent chemotherapy after an incomplete resection (median survival 2.75 versus 0.58 years) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. </p><p>Similarly, a review of the literature suggested that craniospinal irradiation was associated with improved survival compared with more limited fields [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. However, given the association of choroid plexus carcinomas and Li Fraumeni syndrome, it is worthwhile to consider the potential risk of radiation-induced second malignancies in weighing the benefit of craniospinal radiation. Limited data suggest that multiagent intensive chemotherapy with autologous stem cell rescue with deferred radiation may be a reasonable strategy in young children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h1\">EMBRYONAL TUMORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Embryonal tumors typically occur in infants and young children.

The age at presentation ranges from the newborn period to the second decade of life [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/177\" class=\"abstract_t\">177</a>].</p><p>Both conditions are strongly linked to neurocutaneous melanosis, a rare disorder typically associated with giant congenital nevi. Approximately 25 percent of patients with meningeal melanocytosis have significant cutaneous lesions, and approximately 10 to 15 percent of children with giant congenital nevi develop symptomatic melanocytosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Both disorders carry a poor prognosis, even when histological appearance is not malignant.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H38\"><span class=\"h2\">Meningeal melanoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary malignant melanomas arising in the CNS typically occur in the fourth decade, and there is a secondary peak in incidence in the first decade. These melanomas are dural-based, diffuse, poorly circumscribed, and typically invade into the brain or spinal cord parenchyma.</p><p>Although it may be difficult to distinguish a primary melanoma from a metastatic lesion, primary CNS melanoma is typically associated with the meninges while metastatic melanoma more commonly involves the parenchyma. Given the rarity of meningeal melanoma compared with metastatic cutaneous melanoma, however, a systemic evaluation with positron emission tomography <span class=\"nowrap\">(PET)/CT</span> is appropriate whenever a meningeal melanoma is diagnosed.</p><p>Symptoms of primary malignant melanoma are often due to increased intracranial pressure. Other symptoms may include seizures, focal sensory or motor abnormalities, or cranial nerve palsies. On MRI, CNS melanomas are hyperintense on T1 and hypointense on T2; enhancement with gadolinium is present. Occasionally, imaging reveals hemorrhage. The presence of subarachnoid disease may facilitate the diagnosis by cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology.</p><p>Histopathologically, areas of necrosis and hemorrhage may be present. Approximately one-third of tumors do not contain melanin; however, most contain melanosomes, and electron microscopy is helpful in establishing the diagnosis. A high mitotic rate and proliferative index (based upon MIB-1 labeling) are used to distinguish these lesions from meningeal melanocytomas.</p><p>Primary CNS melanomas are highly aggressive tumors. Management is surgical whenever possible, followed by adjuvant radiation; tumors are relatively radioresistant. Overall, the prognosis is poor, with most patients not surviving more than a year [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/178-181\" class=\"abstract_t\">178-181</a>]. Molecular testing for mutations in <em>BRAF</em> is worthwhile given the availability of targeted therapies, although such mutations are uncommon in primary meningeal melanomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Immunotherapy should be considered on a case-by-case basis given successes in advanced cutaneous melanoma, although the safety and efficacy of these therapies in meningeal melanoma has not been established. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=molecularly-targeted-therapy-for-metastatic-melanoma#H100472985\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Molecularly targeted therapy for metastatic melanoma&quot;, section on 'BRAF inhibition'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-advanced-cutaneous-melanoma\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of advanced cutaneous melanoma&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H40\"><span class=\"h1\">CYSTIC LESIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A variety of nonneoplastic lesions can simulate a brain tumor and can give rise to neurologic symptoms. These include epidermoid, dermoid, arachnoid, and colloid cysts.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H41\"><span class=\"h2\">Epidermoid cyst</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Epidermoid cysts, also known as primary cholesteatomas, arise from epithelial cells that are retained during closure of the neural tube. These cysts grow by accumulating cholesterol and keratin from desquamation of the lining epithelium and can encase nearby nerves and arteries.</p><p>Epidermoid cysts usually occur within the basilar cisterns but only rarely occur within the cerebral parenchyma, ventricles, or brainstem [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/182\" class=\"abstract_t\">182</a>]. A retrospective series of 10 patients seen over a 33-year period at a single institution found that six cases originated in the cerebellopontine angle and four in the petrous apex [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/183\" class=\"abstract_t\">183</a>].</p><p>Involvement of multiple cranial nerves and the internal carotid artery is common. Epidermoid cysts can present with loss of hearing, tinnitus, headache, hemifacial spasm, or trigeminal neuralgia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/184\" class=\"abstract_t\">184</a>]. On rare occasions, aseptic meningitis occurs from cyst leakage.</p><p>Imaging studies (computed tomography [CT] and magnetic resonance imaging [MRI]) demonstrate extra-axial lesions whose characteristics are similar to cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Lesions can be confused with meningioma if a CT demonstrates some evidence of calcification or if hemorrhage into the cyst gives a homogeneous high density on noncontrast CT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/185\" class=\"abstract_t\">185</a>]. However, there is minimal to no enhancement. Epidermoid cysts differ from arachnoid cysts on diffusion-weighted imaging, with the diffusion coefficient images of epidermoid cysts similar to parenchyma while that of arachnoid cysts approximates free water [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/184\" class=\"abstract_t\">184</a>].</p><p>Epidermoid cysts are managed with surgery. The cysts tend to grow along cranial nerves and tissue planes, which can make gross total resection of posterior fossa epidermoid cysts impossible. Resection can be associated with postoperative aseptic meningitis from cyst leakage; this generally responds to treatment with steroids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/186,187\" class=\"abstract_t\">186,187</a>].</p><p>Malignant transformation of epidermoid and dermoid cysts into squamous cell carcinoma can occur, either within an existing benign cyst or from a remnant of a previously resected lesion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/188\" class=\"abstract_t\">188</a>]. The development of a squamous cell carcinoma may be manifested by a rapid onset of symptoms, recurrence after a previous resection, or leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. In a review of 52 patients from the literature, the median survival was nine months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/188\" class=\"abstract_t\">188</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H42\"><span class=\"h2\">Dermoid cyst</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Like epidermoid cysts, dermoid cysts arise from epithelial cells that are retained during closure of the neural tube. In addition to squamous epithelium, dermoid cysts contain elements of retained hair, sweat, and sebaceous glands.</p><p>Intracranial dermoid cysts occur most frequently in the posterior fossa, especially the vermis, fourth ventricle, and suprasellar cistern. Cerebellar dermoid cysts are sometimes associated with dermal sinuses of the occiput, which can predispose to bacterial meningitis.</p><p>Dermoid cysts typically present with symptoms due to local mass effect. Spontaneous rupture of the cyst contents into the CSF is rare but can be fatal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/189,190\" class=\"abstract_t\">189,190</a>]. Headache (32 percent) and seizures (30 percent) were the most common symptoms associated with cyst rupture in a series of 44 cases identified from the literature [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/190\" class=\"abstract_t\">190</a>].</p><p>Dermoid cysts are similar to lipomas on imaging. CT reveals hypodense lesions and MRI demonstrating T1 hyperintensity and variable signal on T2; the fat content itself is hyperintense on T1 with other contents being hypointense. There is minimal contrast enhancement. Very occasionally, these cysts can appear like a thrombosed aneurysm with clot in different stages of organization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/191\" class=\"abstract_t\">191</a>].</p><p>Symptomatic dermoid cysts are treated with resection; incompletely resected cysts may gradually recur. Malignant transformation of dermoid cysts may occur and is associated with a poor prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/188\" class=\"abstract_t\">188</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H41\" class=\"local\">'Epidermoid cyst'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H43\"><span class=\"h2\">Colloid cyst</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Colloid cysts are a rare developmental malformation and not a true neoplasm. Colloid cysts are composed of an outer fibrous layer and an inner epithelium of ciliated or mucin producing cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/192,193\" class=\"abstract_t\">192,193</a>].</p><p>The vast majority of colloid cysts occur in the anterior third ventricle, between the forniceal columns in the roof of the third ventricle. Thus, even relatively small lesions may block the foramen of Monro, producing hydrocephalus.</p><p>They can occur at any age but usually become symptomatic in the third to the sixth decades. Although typically asymptomatic, colloid cysts can cause increased intracranial pressure, and present with headache and papilledema [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/194\" class=\"abstract_t\">194</a>]. The headaches are typically frontal, intermittent, severe, of short duration, and associated with nausea and vomiting. The headache can be relieved by lying down [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/195\" class=\"abstract_t\">195</a>]. Occasionally, gait abnormalities may occur as a result of hydrocephalus. The classic clinical description of intermittent headaches and drop attacks occurs in only one-third of patients. Rarely sudden death can occur from obstruction of the ventricular system.</p><p>Imaging demonstrates iso- or hyperdense lesions on noncontrast CT. On MRI they may be T2 hyperintense or have a hypointense center. They do not enhance.</p><p>Surgical excision is curative although it may be technically difficult. For patients with hydrocephalus, a ventriculoperitoneal shunt may be necessary. Stereotactic aspiration of a cyst may be useful, although there is a rate of high recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/196\" class=\"abstract_t\">196</a>]. Patients with small asymptomatic colloid cysts without evidence of hydrocephalus may be closely followed by serial examinations and neuroimaging studies.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H44\"><span class=\"h2\">Arachnoid cyst</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Arachnoid cysts are collections of CSF within the arachnoid membranes, with the CSF secreted by arachnoid cells lining the cyst. While the mechanism of cyst enlargement over time is not well understood, theories include passive diffusion of CSF into the cyst or progressive entrapment due to a ball valve effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/197,198\" class=\"abstract_t\">197,198</a>].</p><p>Arachnoid cysts account for about 1 percent of intracranial masses. The incidence of asymptomatic arachnoid cysts is increasing as more patients undergo neuroimaging procedures for unrelated symptoms. In a retrospective review of over 48,000 consecutive adult brain MRIs, the prevalence of arachnoid cyst was 1.4 percent; of these, only 5 percent were symptomatic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/199\" class=\"abstract_t\">199</a>]. Of those arachnoid cysts that are symptomatic, 75 percent occur in children.</p><p>Arachnoid cysts usually contain clear CSF with a normal cell count and protein. Hemorrhage into the cyst may cause xanthochromia. A markedly elevated protein or pleocytosis suggests the possibility of cystic neoplasm rather than an arachnoid cyst.</p><p>Approximately one-half of arachnoid cysts arise in the Sylvian fissure, although they may occur in any part of the nervous system where there is arachnoid. Other common sites are the cerebral convexity, interhemispheric fissure, suprasellar cistern, quadrigeminal cistern, cerebellopontine angle, midline of the posterior fossa, and the spine. Cysts in the Sylvian fissure are usually asymptomatic but can present with headache, seizure and less commonly, focal neurological deficits. Subdural hematomas may occur following relatively minor head trauma.</p><p>Arachnoid cysts of the craniospinal junction are rare lesions, with less than ten cases reported in the literature. Such cysts extend through the foramen magnum to the level of the upper spine [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/200\" class=\"abstract_t\">200</a>].</p><p>One review of the presenting neurological signs and symptoms in 45 pediatric patients (2 to 17 years old) found that headache was the primary symptom in 61 percent, while 31 percent had epilepsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/201\" class=\"abstract_t\">201</a>]. Among those with seizures, 91 percent had cysts located in the left temporal region [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/201\" class=\"abstract_t\">201</a>].</p><p>Cysts in other locations also have characteristic presentations. Suprasellar cysts usually cause obstructive hydrocephalus; occasionally cysts in this area cause visual <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> endocrine dysfunction. Quadrigeminal and posterior fossa cysts may cause brainstem symptoms as well as hydrocephalus.</p><p>Plain film imaging may reveal thinning of adjacent bone in long standing lesions. CT findings are consistent with CSF density mass with mild mass effect, without enhancement, unless there is concomitant hemorrhage or infection. MRI similarly reveals CSF characteristics (low density on Tl-weighted and high density on T2-weighted images) and no enhancement.</p><p>The differential diagnosis of arachnoid cysts includes chronic subdural hygromas, infarcts, low-grade gliomas, gangliogliomas, epidermoid cysts, and cerebellar hemangioblastomas. Diffusion-weighted imaging (MRI) shows no water diffusion restriction and can be useful in distinguishing arachnoid cysts from epidermoid cysts. In diffusion-weighted images, epidermoid cysts are hyperintense, and ADC maps are hypointense because of their high keratin and cholesterol content and solid nature. In contrast, arachnoid cysts have no restriction to the free movement of water therefore the signal is similar to CSF and the opposite of epidermoid cysts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/202,203\" class=\"abstract_t\">202,203</a>].</p><p>Treatment depends on whether the cysts are symptomatic. Serial imaging and neurologic examinations are adequate in the vast majority of lesions that are asymptomatic. Surgery is indicated if there are symptoms of increased intracranial pressure, seizures, focal neurologic deficits, or cognitive impairment. Surgical options include craniotomy for partial or complete cystectomy, fenestration into the subarachnoid space, or cyst peritoneal shunting. Needle aspiration usually is of temporary benefit and is not a good long-term treatment option [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/204\" class=\"abstract_t\">204</a>]. Patients with suprasellar arachnoid cysts should be monitored for secondary endocrine abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/uncommon-brain-tumors/abstract/205\" class=\"abstract_t\">205</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H45\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Brain tumors are a diverse group of neoplasms arising from different cells within the central nervous system (CNS) or from systemic tumors that have metastasized to the CNS.
