Dermatophytes, particularly <em>Trichophyton rubrum</em>, are the most common causes of onychomycosis. Yeast (eg, <em>Candida albicans</em>) and nondermatophyte molds can also cause onychomycosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=onychomycosis-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Onychomycosis: Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Therapeutic options for onychomycosis include oral antifungal medications, topical antifungal medications, and physical interventions. Factors such as the causative organism, severity of nail involvement, treatment side effects, and patient preference influence treatment selection.</p><p>The management of onychomycosis will be reviewed here. The clinical features and diagnosis of onychomycosis are reviewed separately.

In addition, patients with symptomatic onychomycosis may benefit from measures to reduce discomfort regardless of whether they proceed with curative treatments. (See <a href=\"#H782569968\" class=\"local\">'Symptom relief'</a> below.) </p><p>Topical and systemic antifungal drugs are the mainstays of therapy. Factors that may influence the selection of topical versus systemic therapy include the clinical subtype, causative organism, disease severity, treatment side effects, feasibility of monitoring for side effects, treatment availability, and cost. The major advantage of topical therapy is the negligible risk for serious adverse effects and drug interactions compared with systemic antifungal therapy. However, topical therapy typically requires longer treatment courses than systemic therapy and may be less effective, particularly for disease that is extensive or associated with involvement of the nail matrix and lunula. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=onychomycosis-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H522098449\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Onychomycosis: Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical subtypes'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=onychomycosis-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H522098920\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Onychomycosis: Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Associated clinical features'</a>.)</p><p>Despite the availability of multiple therapies, onychomycosis can be challenging to treat. Treatment failure and disease recurrence are common. (See <a href=\"#H782570590\" class=\"local\">'Treatment failure'</a> below and <a href=\"#H782570596\" class=\"local\">'Recurrence'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3226395320\"><span class=\"h2\">Pretreatment diagnostic testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given the broad differential diagnosis of nail dystrophy, we prefer to confirm the presence of fungi prior to treatment. A typical work-up includes a fungal culture plus a test that yields faster results, such as a potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation or periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=onychomycosis-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Onychomycosis: Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Diagnosis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=onychomycosis-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H267487118\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Onychomycosis: Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Differential diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p>We typically begin treatment prior to the culture result if the KOH preparation or PAS stain identifies fungal elements. Unlike culture, KOH preparations and PAS stains do not confirm the causative organism. Patients are treated for dermatophyte infection (the most common cause of onychomycosis) while awaiting culture results unless the clinical scenario suggests another etiology. As an example, fingernail onychomycosis occurring in association with chronic paronychia is suggestive of <em>Candida</em> infection. (See <a href=\"#H782569231\" class=\"local\">'Dermatophyte onychomycosis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H782569850\" class=\"local\">'Yeast and nondermatophyte mold onychomycosis'</a> below.) &#160;</p><p>However, the cost-effectiveness of diagnostic testing prior to treatment has been questioned. An analysis of published study data that compared costs of immediate <a href=\"topic.htm?path=terbinafine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">terbinafine</a> treatment, treatment after a positive KOH preparation (or after a positive PAS stain in patients with KOH-negative results), and treatment after PAS testing in patients with suspected onychomycosis in the United States found that empirical terbinafine treatment was associated with reduced cost (per-patient cost savings of $47 and $135 for KOH screening and PAS testing models, respectively) and minimal impact on patient safety [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onychomycosis-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This finding is not applicable to all therapies and all locales and may change over time. Empirical treatment with topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=efinaconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">efinaconazole</a> did not appear to be cost-effective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onychomycosis-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H782569231\"><span class=\"h1\">DERMATOPHYTE ONYCHOMYCOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Disease severity influences the therapeutic options for dermatophyte onychomycosis. For mild to moderate known or suspected dermatophyte onychomycosis (eg, distal lateral subungual onychomycosis involving &le;50 percent involvement of the nail and sparing the <span class=\"nowrap\">matrix/lunula),</span> both systemic and topical therapies are options, whereas systemic therapy is the treatment of choice for more severe disease (eg, distal lateral subungual onychomycosis with involvement of &gt;50 percent of the nail or involvement of the <span class=\"nowrap\">matrix/lunula,</span> proximal subungual onychomycosis, or total dystrophic onychomycosis). Local treatment is often sufficient for white superficial onychomycosis because of the superficial location of infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=onychomycosis-epidemiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H522098449\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Onychomycosis: Epidemiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical subtypes'</a> and <a href=\"#H782569271\" class=\"local\">'Mild to moderate dermatophyte onychomycosis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H782569560\" class=\"local\">'Moderate to severe dermatophyte onychomycosis'</a> below and <a href=\"#H782569844\" class=\"local\">'White superficial onychomycosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H782569271\"><span class=\"h2\">Mild to moderate dermatophyte onychomycosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>First-line treatment options for mild to moderate onychomycosis (eg, distal lateral subungual onychomycosis involving &le;50 percent involvement of the nail and sparing the <span class=\"nowrap\">matrix/lunula)</span> include oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=terbinafine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">terbinafine</a> and several topical agents including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=efinaconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">efinaconazole</a>, amorolfine, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tavaborole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tavaborole</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciclopirox-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciclopirox</a>. </p><p>Although oral antifungal therapy is considered the gold standard treatment for onychomycosis because of higher complete cure rates and shorter courses of treatment when compared with topical therapy, the clinical scenario determines whether oral therapy is the most appropriate first-line treatment for mild to moderate onychomycosis. Examples of scenarios in which topical therapy may be preferred include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with contraindications to systemic antifungal therapy</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients at risk for drug-drug interactions with systemic antifungal drugs</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients who prefer to avoid systemic treatment (especially with three or fewer nails involved) </p><p/><p>Children may be more favorable candidates for topical therapy than adults because of a thinner nail plate and potentially faster nail growth rate. A small randomized trial suggested that the likelihood of response to topical <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciclopirox-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciclopirox</a> is higher in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onychomycosis-management/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciclopirox-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">&quot;Ciclopirox: Drug information&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The cost of therapies for onychomycosis varies widely and may influence treatment selection. In 2015, a course of oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=terbinafine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">terbinafine</a> could be obtained for as low as $10 in the United States. In contrast the cost of a course of treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=efinaconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">efinaconazole</a> was greater than $2000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onychomycosis-management/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H782569277\"><span class=\"h3\">Oral terbinafine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=terbinafine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Terbinafine</a> is the first-line oral agent for mild to moderate dermatophyte onychomycosis.

High-quality, head-to-head trials are lacking, leaving insufficient data for definitive conclusions on the comparative efficacy of these therapies.</p><p>Topical treatment is limited to agents specifically indicated for nail disease. Topical antifungal agents developed for cutaneous fungal infections generally are poorly effective for onychomycosis because of poor penetration of the nail plate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onychomycosis-management/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H782569301\"><span class=\"h4\">Efinaconazole</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=efinaconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Efinaconazole</a> is a topical triazole antifungal agent. The efficacy of efinaconazole for onychomycosis was demonstrated in two phase III multicenter randomized trials (n = 870 and n = 785) in which patients with dermatophytic or dermatophytic and candidal distal lateral subungual onychomycosis involving 20 to 50 percent of the target toenail and sparing the matrix and lunula were randomized in a 3 to 1 ratio to treatment with efinaconazole 10% solution or vehicle once daily for 48 weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onychomycosis-management/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Four weeks after the end of treatment, complete cure (0 percent clinical involvement of the target nail and mycologic cure) was achieved by 18 and 15 percent of patients treated with efinaconazole compared with only 3 and 6 percent of patients treated with vehicle. Evaluation of the secondary endpoint of complete or almost complete cure (&le;5 percent clinical involvement of the target toenail and mycologic cure) yielded response rates of 26 and 23 percent with efinaconazole and 7 and 8 percent for placebo.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=efinaconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Efinaconazole</a> 10% solution is applied directly to the nails once daily for 48 weeks.

Avoidance of pedicures, nail polish, or cosmetic nail products is recommended during treatment.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=efinaconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Efinaconazole</a> is well tolerated.

The drug is not available in the United States. </p><p>In two dose-comparison randomized trials, once-weekly application of amorolfine 5% nail lacquer for six months to onychomycosis involving less than 80 percent of the nail surface and lacking involvement of the nail matrix and lunula led to both clinical cure and mycologic cure in 38 and 46 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onychomycosis-management/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. Of note, clinical cure was defined as complete clearance or &le;10 percent of nail remaining affected in one trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onychomycosis-management/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>] and was not clearly defined in the other trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onychomycosis-management/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. </p><p>In addition, there is evidence that amorolfine may increase cure rates when used in combination with oral antifungals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onychomycosis-management/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. In a randomized, open-label trial comparing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=terbinafine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">terbinafine</a> (250 mg per day for three months) plus amorolfine (once weekly for 12 months) versus terbinafine alone, patients who received combination therapy were more likely to achieve both clinical and mycologic cure (59 versus 45 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onychomycosis-management/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Further studies are necessary to determine which patients should be treated with combination therapy.</p><p>Amorolfine is applied once weekly after the surface of the nail is filed with a disposable file and wiped with alcohol.

Other options include extending the treatment course of a topical or oral agent, adding a topical retinoid or topical keratolytic as an adjunctive therapeutic agent, and trials of surgical nail avulsion or other physical interventions.

Methods that are sometimes tried in an attempt to prevent recurrence include intermittent oral antifungal therapy and the application of topical antifungal creams, powders, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ciclopirox-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ciclopirox</a> to affected nails after clinical cure is attained. There is little objective evidence to support these attempts at prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onychomycosis-management/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>].</p><p>There is some evidence supporting the use of amorolfine following successful treatment of onychomycosis. In a randomized trial (n = 52), more patients treated with amorolfine remained disease free three years after initial cure than patients who received no prophylactic therapy (70 versus 50 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onychomycosis-management/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. However, a separate prospective study reported no significant difference in the rate of recurrence of onychomycosis with or without amorolfine prophylaxis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onychomycosis-management/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].

Treatment of onychomycosis is not mandatory in all patients. Indications for treatment include a history of repeated lower extremity cellulitis, diabetes plus risk factors for cellulitis, immunosuppression, and nail pain or discomfort. The patient's desire for treatment because of cosmetic concerns is another common reason for treatment. (See <a href=\"#H782569047\" class=\"local\">'Approach to treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Because of the broad differential of nail dystrophy, we prefer to confirm fungal infection prior to treatment. A typical work-up includes a fungal culture plus a test that yields faster results, such as a potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation or periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) stain. If the KOH preparation or PAS stain is positive for fungal infection, we begin treatment. While awaiting culture results, patients are treated for dermatophyte infection (the most common cause of onychomycosis) unless the clinical findings suggest another etiology. (See <a href=\"#H3226395320\" class=\"local\">'Pretreatment diagnostic testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with mild to moderate dermatophyte onychomycosis (eg, distal lateral subungual onychomycosis involving &le;50 percent involvement of the nail and sparing the <span class=\"nowrap\">matrix/lunula),</span> we suggest treatment with oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=terbinafine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">terbinafine</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Patients who have contraindications to systemic antifungal therapy, who are at risk for drug-drug interactions with systemic antifungal drugs, or who prefer to avoid systemic treatment can be treated with topical therapy. (See <a href=\"#H782569271\" class=\"local\">'Mild to moderate dermatophyte onychomycosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with moderate to severe dermatophyte onychomycosis (eg, dermatophyte onychomycosis involving &gt;50 percent of the nail or involving the matrix or lunula, proximal subungual onychomycosis, or total dystrophic onychomycosis), we suggest treatment with oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=terbinafine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">terbinafine</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">itraconazole</a> is an alternative treatment for patients who cannot tolerate terbinafine or for patients who fail to respond to terbinafine.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Data are limited on the treatment of yeast and nondermatophyte mold onychomycosis. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=itraconazole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Itraconazole</a> is the mainstay of treatment for these variants. Oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=terbinafine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">terbinafine</a> may also be effective for some patients. (See <a href=\"#H782569850\" class=\"local\">'Yeast and nondermatophyte mold onychomycosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with pain or discomfort from onychomycotic nails may benefit from removal of hyperkeratotic nail debris. Application of topical urea under occlusion can help with debridement of the nail and symptom improvement. (See <a href=\"#H782569968\" class=\"local\">'Symptom relief'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Recurrence after treatment of onychomycosis is common. Aggressive treatment of tinea pedis after resolution of onychomycosis may be beneficial for reducing risk for recurrence. The role of prophylactic antifungal therapy for onychomycosis is uncertain. (See <a href=\"#H782570596\" class=\"local\">'Recurrence'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/onychomycosis-management/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Roujeau JC, Sigurgeirsson B, Korting HC, et al.
