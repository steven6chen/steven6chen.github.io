In practice, however, nearly all of the available treatments are symptomatic in nature and do not appear to slow or reverse the natural course of the disease.</p><p>This topic will review potential disease-modifying therapies for PD. Other aspects of PD are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=etiology-and-pathogenesis-of-parkinson-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Etiology and pathogenesis of Parkinson disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-parkinson-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of Parkinson disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-parkinson-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis and differential diagnosis of Parkinson disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacologic-treatment-of-parkinson-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacologic treatment of Parkinson disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">BACKGROUND</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Disease-modifying therapy is defined as an intervention that can change the course of a neurodegenerative disease by slowing or reversing progression. For PD, therapy that is disease-modifying or neuroprotective therapies is still theoretical. Neuroprotective therapy for PD is based on the concept that the three to four hundred thousand at-risk dopaminergic neurons in the human substantia nigra can somehow be protected from the complex degenerative process that causes premature cell death and depletion of dopamine. Once identified and shown to be effective, neuroprotective drugs could be used in patients with early clinical signs of disease or potentially even prior to the appearance of disease in those shown to be at genetic risk. Several potential neuroprotective agents for PD have shown some promise in animals <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> humans, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selegiline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">selegiline</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rasagiline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rasagiline</a> (both monoamine oxidase inhibitors), and the natural substance coenzyme Q10. However, no treatment to date has proven to be effective for neuroprotection in PD.</p><p>Our suggested approach for patients with newly diagnosed PD is to make them aware that most of the current therapeutic research in PD involves a search for neuroprotective and disease-modifying interventions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/potential-disease-modifying-therapies-for-parkinson-disease/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]; this gives them hope. To date, however, only weak signals have emerged for a few agents.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">LEVODOPA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Accumulating clinical trial data suggest that levodopa either slows the progression of PD or has a prolonged benefit even after the drug has been stopped. These data are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacologic-treatment-of-parkinson-disease#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacologic treatment of Parkinson disease&quot;, section on 'Levodopa'</a>.)</p><p>The 2006 American Academy of Neurology practice parameter concluded that levodopa is possibly neuroprotective for at least nine months and does not accelerate disease progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/potential-disease-modifying-therapies-for-parkinson-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">MAO B INHIBITORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Monoamine oxidase (MAO B) inhibitors such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selegiline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">selegiline</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rasagiline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rasagiline</a> have been studied as neuroprotective agents due to their ability to block free radical formation from the oxidative metabolism of dopamine; these agents may also inhibit apoptosis (programmed cell death) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/potential-disease-modifying-therapies-for-parkinson-disease/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In addition to a possible neuroprotective effect, rasagiline and selegiline have a mild symptomatic benefit. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacologic-treatment-of-parkinson-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacologic treatment of Parkinson disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Rasagiline</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The selective MAO B inhibitor <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rasagiline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rasagiline</a> has neuroprotective properties in animal models. However, human trials have yielded inconsistent findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A short-term randomized controlled trial (TEMPO) published in 2004 suggested that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rasagiline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rasagiline</a> could slow progression of parkinsonian disability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/potential-disease-modifying-therapies-for-parkinson-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Using a delayed start design, the trial found that patients assigned to early treatment with rasagiline monotherapy had a smaller increase in mean adjusted total Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) score (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F68974\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef68974 \">table 1</a>) than those who were initially assigned to placebo for six months before starting rasagiline [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/potential-disease-modifying-therapies-for-parkinson-disease/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. However, the symptomatic benefit of rasagiline, rather than a neuroprotective effect, may have been responsible for this result [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/potential-disease-modifying-therapies-for-parkinson-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In an open-label extension of the TEMPO trial with 6.5 years of follow-up published in 2009, the group assigned to earlier initiation of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rasagiline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rasagiline</a> showed a statistically significant slower progression of PD, as measured by the UPDRS score [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/potential-disease-modifying-therapies-for-parkinson-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This finding could be interpreted to support a neuroprotective or disease modifying effect of rasagiline. Alternatively, it might reflect an effect on endogenous compensatory mechanisms in early PD, such that the early introduction of any symptomatic treatment for PD results in a better clinical outcome than delayed administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/potential-disease-modifying-therapies-for-parkinson-disease/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The extension study must be interpreted very cautiously because of its open-label design, high (approximately 50 percent) drop-out rate, and statistical methodology that did not account for missing data due to loss of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/potential-disease-modifying-therapies-for-parkinson-disease/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The ADAGIO trial also used a delayed start design to evaluate <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rasagiline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rasagiline</a> at two doses (1 mg and 2 mg daily) in 1176 subjects with untreated PD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/potential-disease-modifying-therapies-for-parkinson-disease/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The group assigned to early start with rasagiline 1 mg daily met all prespecified criteria for a possible disease-modifying effect of rasagiline. However, the group assigned to early start with rasagiline 2 mg did not, because the change in total UPDRS score between baseline and week 72 was not significantly different compared with the 2 mg late start group. Thus, the two different doses were associated with different outcomes, and the overall trial results are inconclusive regarding a possible neuroprotective effect of rasagiline.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">A subsequent analysis of the ADAGIO trial found that, compared with placebo, both <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rasagiline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rasagiline</a> 1 mg and 2 mg daily delayed the need for additional symptomatic antiparkinsonian medications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/potential-disease-modifying-therapies-for-parkinson-disease/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However, this outcome currently remains unsettled and may be explained by the known symptomatic effect of rasagiline and other monoamine oxidase B inhibitors for improvement of PD symptoms.</p><p/><p>The 2006 American Academy of Neurology (AAN) practice parameter concluded that there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rasagiline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rasagiline</a> for neuroprotection in patients with PD [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/potential-disease-modifying-therapies-for-parkinson-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This conclusion remains valid despite the additional data from the 2009 TEMPO extension study and the 2009 ADAGIO trial.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2432865\"><span class=\"h2\">Selegiline</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The possibility of long-term neuroprotection with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selegiline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">selegiline</a> has neither been confirmed nor disproven:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A large prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study (the DATATOP study) found that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selegiline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">selegiline</a> (deprenyl) 10 mg daily delayed the progression of parkinsonian signs in previously untreated patients by nine months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/potential-disease-modifying-therapies-for-parkinson-disease/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. However, a small but measurable reduction of parkinsonian symptoms attributable to selegiline confounded the findings of this study, thereby casting doubt on the likelihood that the delayed progression of symptoms was due to a true neuroprotective effect.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A subsequent trial that took this symptomatic effect into account noted a mild neuroprotective effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/potential-disease-modifying-therapies-for-parkinson-disease/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=selegiline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Selegiline</a> treatment of patients with early PD in the absence of levodopa was associated with a decreased risk for developing later freezing of gait [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/potential-disease-modifying-therapies-for-parkinson-disease/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], suggesting a possible neuroprotective effect.</p><p/><p>Prior treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selegiline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">selegiline</a> in the DATATOP cohort did not reduce the occurrence of subsequent levodopa-associated motor fluctuations in this population [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/potential-disease-modifying-therapies-for-parkinson-disease/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]; no persistent, long-term benefit in slowing the progression of PD was demonstrated with selegiline.</p><p>This lack of long-term benefit in part accounted for the conclusion issued in a 2002 report of the Quality Standards Subcommittee of the AAN that there is insufficient evidence to recommend the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selegiline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">selegiline</a> for a neuroprotective effect [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/potential-disease-modifying-therapies-for-parkinson-disease/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. A practice parameter from the AAN issued in 2006 found no interim studies that would alter this conclusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/potential-disease-modifying-therapies-for-parkinson-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">DOPAMINE AGONISTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dopamine agonists appeared to be neuroprotective in the laboratory because they are antioxidants and free radical scavengers and because of feedback reduction of endogenous dopamine turnover [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/potential-disease-modifying-therapies-for-parkinson-disease/abstract/15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,16</a>]. These findings led to the hypothesis, which remains unproven, that the use of agonists early in the clinical course of PD might slow progression of the underlying neurodegeneration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/potential-disease-modifying-therapies-for-parkinson-disease/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>A number of studies employed radiographic markers of basal ganglia function (ie, single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) with the dopamine transporter ligand [123I]beta-CIT (B-CIT), and positron emission tomography (PET) scanning with the dopa decarboxylase ligand 18F-fluorodopa ([18]F-dopa)) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/potential-disease-modifying-therapies-for-parkinson-disease/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. Although controversial, these reports when originally published suggested a possible neuroprotective effect of dopamine agonists (see <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Pramipexole'</a> below and <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Ropinirole'</a> below). However, later commentary cast considerable doubt on the validity of that conclusion because of the possibility that the neuroimaging changes resulted from a direct effect of the antiparkinson drugs on uptake of the ligands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/potential-disease-modifying-therapies-for-parkinson-disease/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p>In fact, the 2006 American Academy of Neurology (AAN) practice parameter noted that the studies evaluating <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pramipexole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pramipexole</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ropinirole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ropinirole</a> as agents of neuroprotection were uncertain, given the lack of validation for the surrogate measures of neuroprotection employed (ie, SPECT B-CIT and (18)F-dopa PET scans) and the absence of placebo control groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/potential-disease-modifying-therapies-for-parkinson-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The AAN therefore concluded that there is insufficient evidence to support or refute the use of pramipexole or ropinirole for neuroprotection in patients with PD.</p><p>A trial using a delayed-start design to assess clinical endpoints did not support a neuroprotective effect of dopamine agonists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/potential-disease-modifying-therapies-for-parkinson-disease/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>], and other clinical data argue against a neuroprotective effect of dopamine agonists [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/potential-disease-modifying-therapies-for-parkinson-disease/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Pramipexole</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The available evidence, though not entirely consistent, does not support a neuroprotective effect of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pramipexole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pramipexole</a>.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The CALM-PD study evaluated 82 patients with early PD, using SPECT B-CIT scans as a surrogate marker of neuroprotection, and found that the patients who were randomly assigned to receive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pramipexole-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pramipexole</a> demonstrated less of a decline in striatal B-CIT uptake over four years compared with those treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbidopa-and-levodopa-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbidopa-levodopa</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/potential-disease-modifying-therapies-for-parkinson-disease/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].

In addition, for 123 patients in the neuroimaging substudy assigned to early versus delayed initiation of pramipexole, there was no significant difference in striatal dopamine-transporter binding assessed by SPECT B-CIT scans.

All patients continued their regular medications during the trial and were assessed for outcomes in an off-medication state (ie, withdrawal of levodopa for at least 8 hours and longer-lasting anti-Parkinson medications for 36 hours). At 60 weeks, off-medication scores on the motor subscale (part three) of the Movement Disorders Society Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (MDS-UPDRS) showed a small improvement for the exenatide group and a small worsening for the placebo group, with a significant adjusted mean difference of -3.5 points (95% CI -6.7 to -0.3). It is uncertain if this result was due to a neuroprotective or symptomatic effect of exenatide. Both the exenatide and placebo groups showed a decline in striatal dopamine transporter binding measured by 123I-FP-CIT single photon emission tomography (DaTscan), but the rate of decline was significantly less for the exenatide group. However, there were no differences between groups in any of the secondary outcome measures. The most common adverse effects for both groups were injection site reactions and gastrointestinal symptoms.</p><p>Important limitations of this trial include small patient numbers and baseline imbalances between groups (eg, the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=exenatide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">exenatide</a> group had higher MDS-UPDRS motor subscale scores than the placebo group) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/potential-disease-modifying-therapies-for-parkinson-disease/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].
