Accurate diagnosis of venom allergy is important because patients with venom allergy are candidates for venom immunotherapy, a treatment which can dramatically reduce the risk of recurrent severe reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hymenoptera-venom-allergy/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. The diagnosis of Hymenoptera allergy (not including stinging ants), which is based upon the clinical history and supported by testing for the presence of venom-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies, will be reviewed here. The indications and protocols for venom immunotherapy are presented separately.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-efficacy-indications-and-mechanism-of-action\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hymenoptera venom immunotherapy: Efficacy, indications, and mechanism of action&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-technical-issues-protocols-adverse-effects-and-monitoring\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hymenoptera venom immunotherapy: Technical issues, protocols, adverse effects, and monitoring&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bee-yellow-jacket-wasp-and-other-hymenoptera-stings-reaction-types-and-acute-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bee, yellow jacket, wasp, and other Hymenoptera stings: Reaction types and acute management&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p>Other types of Hymenoptera of medical importance are stinging ants (fire ants, harvester ants, bulldog ants, and jack jumper ants). Patients with allergy to winged Hymenoptera should not be presumed to be allergic to stinging ants, unless there is a clinical history to suggest this. Allergy to fire ant venom is discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stings-of-imported-fire-ants-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stings of imported fire ants: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5607322\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF REACTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reactions to Hymenoptera stings are broadly divided into local and systemic reactions. These reactions are described briefly here and discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bee-yellow-jacket-wasp-and-other-hymenoptera-stings-reaction-types-and-acute-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Bee, yellow jacket, wasp, and other Hymenoptera stings: Reaction types and acute management&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1576864306\"><span class=\"h2\">Local reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A local reaction is defined as any reaction in which the signs and symptoms are confined to tissues contiguous with the sting site. Most people develop only minor local reactions to Hymenoptera stings, which are not considered a form of allergic reaction.</p><p>Less commonly, patients may develop large local reactions (LLRs). A LLR consists of painful swelling and erythema limited to skin and subcutaneous tissues <strong>contiguous with the sting site</strong>. The affected area is typically &gt;10 cm and may be much larger. The reaction usually peaks at 24 to 48 hours and may last 3 to 10 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hymenoptera-venom-allergy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1558667393\"><span class=\"h2\">Systemic reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Systemic allergic reactions cause signs and symptoms distant from the site of the sting and include a spectrum of manifestations, ranging from mild to life-threatening. Systemic reactions can be further divided into reactions involving multiple organ systems and reactions limited to the skin:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An anaphylactic reaction involves signs and symptoms of immunoglobulin E (IgE)-mediated allergy, typically <strong>affecting more than one organ system</strong> (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F66333\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66333 \">table 1</a>). The skin (urticaria and angioedema) is commonly involved, but respiratory or circulatory symptoms are also prominent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F82831\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82831 \">figure 1</a>). Some of the most severe reactions (eg, sudden hypotension) occur in the absence of any skin findings or can be refractory to single or multiple doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hymenoptera-venom-allergy/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A <strong>cutaneous</strong> systemic reaction (or a generalized cutaneous reaction) consists of signs and symptoms limited to the skin (ie, pruritus, erythema, urticaria, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> angioedema), which is usually widespread and involves skin that is <strong>not contiguous with the sting site</strong>. Reactions involving angioedema of the tongue or throat, which could compromise the airway, are generally excluded from this category and considered anaphylactic reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hymenoptera-venom-allergy/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hymenoptera stings are acutely painful, and patients are usually aware that a sting has occurred, although they may not have visualized the insect clearly. Witnesses who know the patient's normal appearance and behavior may have noticed signs and symptoms during anaphylaxis that the patient does not recall, including changes in voice (laryngeal angioedema), fluctuating or reduced level of consciousness, inability to communicate clearly, flushing, or visible angioedema.</p><p>A comprehensive history should review the patient's past stings and risk for future stings (ie, occupation and hobbies) and determine whether the patient's reaction was local or systemic. The following questions need to be addressed:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How long ago did the sting event occur?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How many stings were sustained?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After the stings occurred, how much time elapsed before symptoms first appeared?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Where on the body did the sting occur? As an example, a sting on the face could cause extensive facial angioedema as part of a local reaction, but the same symptom from a sting on the leg would indicate a systemic response.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients should be asked specifically about symptoms affecting various organ systems, as the most memorable symptom is typically reported while other symptoms are overlooked.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Which insect does the patient believe stung <span class=\"nowrap\">him/her</span> (although often not reliable)?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Was the patient taking any medications that might have worsened the response to the sting, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or beta-blockers? This information is relevant to risk assessment.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How was the reaction treated, and were there any delayed symptoms?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Were there any previous stings, and if so, did those result in normal, large local, or systemic symptoms? A large local reaction (LLR) consists of an area of redness and swelling at the site of the sting (typically approximately 10 cm in diameter) that enlarges over 48 hours and gradually resolves over 5 to 10 days.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Have there been any subsequent stings, and if so, what symptoms developed?</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Does the patient have regular exposure to Hymenoptera insects (ie, resulting from occupational or recreational activities)?</p><p/><p>If possible, any records that can be retrieved from emergency medical services or emergency departments should be reviewed to see if additional information is recorded that was not known or remembered by the patient.</p><p>Patients with systemic reactions should be evaluated further with testing for venom-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE). Testing of patients with local reactions is not usually necessary, although there are exceptions. (See <a href=\"#H5607864\" class=\"local\">'Patients with large local reactions'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H136224544\"><span class=\"h2\">Identification of the culprit species</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Attempts should be made to determine which specific insect stung the patient, based on its appearance and behavior. The two families of winged Hymenoptera that account for most stings are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Apidae family (honey bees)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Vespidae family (yellow jackets, yellow hornets, white-faced hornets, and paper wasps)</p><p/><p>If the patient cannot describe the insect in question, it can sometimes be identified based upon the patient's geographic location or setting in which the sting occurred. In addition, nests may be seen. Physical features and behaviors of the different Hymenoptera species are presented in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=stinging-insects-biology-and-identification\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Stinging insects: Biology and identification&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS OF VENOM ALLERGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of allergy to Hymenoptera venom requires <strong>both</strong> of the following elements [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hymenoptera-venom-allergy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>History of a sting event that resulted in a systemic allergic reaction. (See <a href=\"#H1558667393\" class=\"local\">'Systemic reactions'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evidence of venom-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE), either by skin testing or in vitro testing (ie, IgE immunoassay).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2224787157\"><span class=\"h2\">Referral</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The evaluation and diagnosis of venom allergy can be challenging. Venom skin testing, which should only be performed by clinicians trained in the technique, is preferred over IgE immunoassays as an initial testing modality in most cases. In addition, patients with demonstrable IgE-mediated venom allergy should be offered venom immunotherapy, which is highly effective and significantly reduces the patient's chance of experiencing systemic reactions to future stings. For these reasons, any patient with a possible systemic reaction to a Hymenoptera sting should be referred to an allergy specialist for evaluation, diagnosis, and treatment. Patients with other types of sting reactions (eg, bothersome large local reactions [LLRs] or cutaneous systemic reactions) may also benefit from referral.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1581795979\"><span class=\"h1\">INDICATIONS FOR TESTING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To understand the indications for testing for venom allergy, it is important to understand the significance of positive results, the limitations of negative results, and how this information applies to specific groups of patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1925453854\"><span class=\"h2\">Significance of venom-specific IgE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of venom-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) antibodies, <strong>without</strong> the history of a systemic reaction to a previous sting, is not sufficient to make the diagnosis of a venom allergy or predict that the patient is at elevated risk for a systemic reaction to a future sting. This is true because depending on the study, 27 to 40 percent of adults in the general population have detectable venom-specific IgE in the serum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hymenoptera-venom-allergy/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>], yet only 0.3 to 7.5 percent of adults report ever experiencing a systemic reaction to a sting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hymenoptera-venom-allergy/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. Thus, the positive predictive value of venom-specific IgE for the detection of clinically significant venom allergy is low in the general population. For this reason, testing is usually only indicated in patients with suspected or known systemic allergic reactions to stings. (See <a href=\"#H12724836\" class=\"local\">'Patients with past systemic reactions to stings'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Indications for testing in specific patient groups</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Testing is most clearly indicated in patients with suspected or known systemic allergic reactions to stings. The purpose of testing in these patients is the confirmation of venom allergy and determination of which venoms should be used in immunotherapy. Testing is occasionally indicated in patients with other types of reactions. The indications for testing parallel the indications for venom immunotherapy, which are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-efficacy-indications-and-mechanism-of-action#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hymenoptera venom immunotherapy: Efficacy, indications, and mechanism of action&quot;, section on 'Indications and patient selection'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12724836\"><span class=\"h3\">Patients with past systemic reactions to stings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Testing for venom allergy is indicated in any patient with a history that is suggestive or convincing for a past systemic allergic reaction to a sting that involved organs other than the skin (ie, with or without cutaneous symptoms). This includes patients in whom the sting event and systemic reaction occurred decades earlier because the risk of another reaction can persist for many years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hymenoptera-venom-allergy/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2316216263\"><span class=\"h3\">Patients with cutaneous systemic reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In patients with isolated <span class=\"nowrap\">urticaria/angioedema,</span> the chance of a future systemic reaction has been estimated at about 7 to 10 percent per sting, and most of these reactions will also be limited to the skin (ie, fewer than 3 percent will have severe anaphylaxis). Therefore, testing and immunotherapy are not indicated in most cases. Studies supporting a low risk of future severe systemic reactions are reviewed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-efficacy-indications-and-mechanism-of-action#H2679377495\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hymenoptera venom immunotherapy: Efficacy, indications, and mechanism of action&quot;, section on 'Risk of recurrent reactions'</a>.)</p><p>However, there may be individuals who find these reactions sufficiently distressing or have unavoidable exposure (eg, bee keepers, landscapers, outdoor enthusiasts, etc) and are motivated to undergo venom immunotherapy to mitigate future similar reactions. In such cases, testing would be appropriate to determine which venoms to include in treatment.</p><p>Because of the low risk of future anaphylaxis, it is the author's and editors' approach not to prescribe <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> autoinjectors in this situation. However, some allergists do prescribe epinephrine for such patients. If this is done or if there are other quality of life issues affecting the <span class=\"nowrap\">patient/family</span> (such as fear surrounding stings), the allergist should follow-up with the patient in one year to review any subsequent stings and determine if epinephrine is still needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4475418\"><span class=\"h3\">Patients without a sting history</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>On occasion, an individual who has no history of an allergic reaction may present with concern about the possibility of developing a severe reaction to a sting, often because one or more family members has Hymenoptera venom allergy. Testing for venom-specific IgE is <strong>not</strong> indicated in this situation. Asymptomatic sensitization to honey bee and vespid venoms may be as high as 40 percent, and the meaning of a positive result without the history of a systemic reaction is unclear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hymenoptera-venom-allergy/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Epidemiologic studies have shown that most patients with venom anaphylaxis have no family history of venom allergy, although there are occasional families in which several members are affected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hymenoptera-venom-allergy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The best approach to assisting such patients is to recommend against testing and instead explain that the patient's risk of ever experiencing a systemic reaction is approximately 0.4 to 0.8 percent in children and 3 percent in adults (as in the general population in the United States), and then address any specific issues that concern the patient [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hymenoptera-venom-allergy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Many people can be simply reassured that they are not at increased risk for a serious reaction, despite their family history. Others are reassured by the advice to carry an <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> autoinjector, accompanied by clear instructions on how and when to use it, although we discourage this approach for most patients because it sends a fundamentally mixed message. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-an-epinephrine-autoinjector-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Use of an epinephrine autoinjector (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anaphylaxis-symptoms-and-diagnosis-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Anaphylaxis symptoms and diagnosis (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5607864\"><span class=\"h3\">Patients with large local reactions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Testing is not indicated in most patients with large local reactions (LLRs). LLRs carry no more than a 5 to 10 percent risk of a future systemic reaction (with a &lt;3 percent risk of severe anaphylaxis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hymenoptera-venom-allergy/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>], so venom testing and venom immunotherapy are generally not indicated. However, as in the case of cutaneous systemic reactions, there may be individuals with frequent, severe LLRs that compromise quality of life or ability to work. Such patients may be motivated to undergo venom immunotherapy, in which case testing is indicated to determine which venoms to include in treatment. LLRs are usually caused by an IgE-mediated late-phase response, and venom immunotherapy can successfully reduce future LLRs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hymenoptera-venom-allergy/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Studies of efficacy in this subset of patients are discussed in more detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hymenoptera-venom-immunotherapy-efficacy-indications-and-mechanism-of-action#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Hymenoptera venom immunotherapy: Efficacy, indications, and mechanism of action&quot;, section on 'Patients with large local reactions'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5607677\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPARISON OF TESTING METHODS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Testing for venom-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE) can be performed by skin testing or in vitro testing. Skin testing is preferred over in vitro methods for initial testing in most patients because skin testing is somewhat more sensitive and less expensive than in vitro tests in most health care systems. Skin testing is positive in 66 to 90 percent of patients with a history suggestive of venom allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hymenoptera-venom-allergy/abstract/3,11,21-24\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,11,21-24</a>]. In addition, 15 to 20 percent of patients with positive skin tests will have negative in vitro testing. Therefore, if skin testing is positive and the results support the clinical history (ie, reliable identification of culprit insect), then in vitro testing is not needed. However, 5 to 10 percent of patients with negative skin tests may have positive in vitro results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hymenoptera-venom-allergy/abstract/21,25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,25,26</a>]. Thus, if skin testing is negative with a suggestive clinical history or skin testing cannot be performed, then in vitro testing is indicated.</p><p>In vitro testing is also helpful when the results of skin testing and the clinical history are not fully consistent or leave unanswered questions. An example would be the patient who developed anaphylaxis following a sting while eating outdoors but never visualized the insect, and skin testing shows sensitization only to honey bee. The clinician might be reasonably concerned that honey bee was not the true culprit insect, based on the tendency of yellow jackets to be more aggressive and attracted to human food. In this case, in vitro testing might be pursued in order to determine if the patient was sensitized to yellow jacket or other species, as well as to honey bee, before initiating venom immunotherapy. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'In vitro testing'</a> below.)</p><p>The combination of skin testing and in vitro testing with the commercial assays in common use should detect approximately 95 percent of patients who will have a systemic reaction to a subsequent sting. The remaining patients pose a diagnostic dilemma that is discussed below. (See <a href=\"#H523752665\" class=\"local\">'Systemic reactions with negative testing'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">SKIN TESTING</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Skin testing should be performed by an <span class=\"nowrap\">allergist/immunologist</span> or other clinician who has training and experience in the diagnosis and treatment of insect allergy, in a setting equipped to manage anaphylaxis, although this rarely occurs with skin testing. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Technique'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-skin-testing-for-allergic-disease#H6476491\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of skin testing for allergic disease&quot;, section on 'Safety'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Timing of testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the sting event was recent, we suggest waiting at least four to six weeks before performing skin testing, when possible. Many patients demonstrate reduced skin sensitivity to venom within the first few weeks after a systemic reaction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hymenoptera-venom-allergy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Despite these issues, there are clinical scenarios in which it is advantageous to test immediately in order to initiate venom immunotherapy. However, if testing is performed during this period, a negative result (ie, lack of response) should be interpreted with great caution, and testing should be repeated at a later date.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Choice of venoms for testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Testing should be performed with venoms from <strong>all potentially relevant insects</strong> from the geographic area in question.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1718780927\"><span class=\"h3\">Common species</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Skin testing should include all of the venoms relevant to the patient's geographic area. In the United States, this would generally include all of the following venoms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Honey bee</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Yellow jacket</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Yellow hornet</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>White-faced hornet</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wasp</p><p/><p>Africanized honey bees are less common, but skin testing with domestic honey bee venom will detect sensitization to Africanized honey bee as well. Africanized honey bees were imported to South America from Africa and have continued to migrate north though the southern United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hymenoptera-venom-allergy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. While domestic honey bees are generally not aggressive, Africanized honey bees are very aggressive and often attack and sting in large numbers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hymenoptera-venom-allergy/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H953596213\"><span class=\"h3\">Bumble bees</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Allergic reactions to bumble bee field stings are rare compared with honey bees and other Hymenoptera because of their nonaggressive behavior. However, allergic reactions have been reported, particularly among greenhouse workers, as a result of occupational exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hymenoptera-venom-allergy/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. In the absence of a specific history to suggest a bumble bee sting, patients with sting reactions do not need to be screened for this allergy. If a bumble bee allergy is suspected, specific bumble bee venom would be optimal for skin testing. This is available in some countries (not in the United States). However, there is a commercially available immunoglobulin E (IgE) immunoassay to bumble bee venom available in the United States and elsewhere. Bumble bee-allergic patients should also be tested for allergy to honey bee because there is some cross-reactivity between the two venoms, and some individuals may be sensitized to both. Once a bumble bee venom allergy is confirmed, bumble bee venom would be the best choice for immunotherapy if available (eg, in limited areas of Europe) because honey bee venom immunotherapy may not protect the patient against bumble bee stings. If the patient is sensitized only to bumble bee and bumble bee venom is not available, then the best management is avoidance and the availability of self-administered <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2113392465\"><span class=\"h3\">Venomous ants</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clinicians practicing in areas inhabited by venomous ants should also be mindful of these insects as a possible cause of systemic reactions to stings. Patients can usually tell ant stings from other Hymenoptera stings, but the history is sometimes ambiguous (eg, a sting on a child's scalp may not be noticed until well after an event) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hymenoptera-venom-allergy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. If there is uncertainty, then the patient should be tested for ant venom allergy also. The geographic location of fire ants and testing for fire ant allergy are reviewed in detail separately.

Unlike skin testing for other types of allergies, prick (epicutaneous) testing is not necessarily done first, although this may be prudent in patients who experienced severe anaphylaxis and may be highly sensitive to venom. A concentration of 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> is used for prick testing.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4212664026\"><span class=\"h3\">Safety</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Skin testing to venom allergens rarely results in systemic allergic reactions, and the amount of venom introduced into the skin is significantly less than that of a single sting. However, this adverse effect is possible with any type of skin testing, as discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-skin-testing-for-allergic-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of skin testing for allergic disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2790692891\"><span class=\"h3\">Traditional approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most widely practiced approach to intradermal venom testing is to begin with venom concentrations between 0.001 to 0.01 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span>. Testing then proceeds at intervals of 20 to 30 minutes with incremental 10-fold increases in concentration until a positive skin test response occurs or a maximum concentration of 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> is reached. Concentrations higher than 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> should not be used, because they may result in irritant reactions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-of-hymenoptera-venom-allergy/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. This sequential approach is generally considered the safest and is recommended by practice parameters. It is also the preferred approach in research studies because changes in sensitivity can be assessed over time using an &quot;endpoint dilution&quot; technique.

The patient population included individuals with all severities of sting reactions (24 percent had severe anaphylaxis), as well as those taking beta-blockers and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors.

(See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Skin testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Skin testing should be performed using the venoms of all the Hymenoptera insects known to reside in the patient's geographic area. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Choice of venoms for testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If skin testing is negative, venom-specific IgE immunoassays should be obtained. The combination of skin testing and in vitro testing can detect about 95 percent of patients who will suffer another systemic reaction if stung again. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'In vitro testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In all patients who experienced a moderate or severe systemic reaction to a Hymenoptera sting, a baseline serum tryptase should be measured to screen for an underlying mast cell disorder. Some experts recommend screening any patient for whom venom immunotherapy is recommended, and practice in this area is evolving as data become available. Any elevation in serum tryptase should be evaluated further. (See <a href=\"#H20\" class=\"local\">'Screening for occult mastocytosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If both skin testing and venom-specific IgE are negative and serum tryptase is normal and yet there is a convincing history of a systemic reaction, then the patient should be retested for venom-specific IgE in three to six months. In addition, the patient should be educated about appropriate sting avoidance and treatment of reactions.
