The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that anemia affects one-quarter of the world's population and is concentrated within preschool-aged children and women; anemia in the majority of individuals is due to iron deficiency. Iron deficiency is a particularly challenging problem for resource-limited nations in Asia and Africa [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-deficiency-in-infants-and-children-less-than12-years-treatment/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. In the United States and other resource-rich countries, rates of iron deficiency are substantially lower and are gradually improving. Nonetheless, iron deficiency remains common and has important consequences for health and neurodevelopment.

For optimal absorption, the iron should be given between meals and with water or juice, and milk products should be avoided. Iron absorption is more effective when given with juice rather than milk (13.7 versus 5.7 percent absorbed in one report) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-deficiency-in-infants-and-children-less-than12-years-treatment/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. </p><p>Standard recommended dosing is 3 to 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> elemental iron per day. We choose to use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ferrous-sulfate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ferrous sulfate</a> and the 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> dose because it was effective in a randomized clinical trial of 80 young children (ages 9 to 48 months) with nutritional IDA (<a href=\"https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01904864&amp;token=nbsXe3i4qfUea5RCPRHtOS7yhoEzH+MCpwZ1/1ekxPN9poO6bgV+dPs9JGG4LkhnKTSG3Rc66xnSg+k5rI/6tw==&amp;TOPIC_ID=15647\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">NCT01904864</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-deficiency-in-infants-and-children-less-than12-years-treatment/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Similarly, studies in adults have demonstrated efficacy, improved tolerance, and higher fractional absorption of oral iron in persons treated with relatively low doses of oral iron therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-deficiency-in-infants-and-children-less-than12-years-treatment/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].

Larger doses rarely are necessary and may produce some degree of intolerance. </p><p>Oral iron is best absorbed on an empty stomach when taken with water or juice. It should not be taken with milk or other dairy and calcium-containing products as this will lessen its absorption. There are limited data on whether taking oral iron with meals lessens gastrointestinal side effects. </p><p>Liquid preparations of iron occasionally cause gray staining of the teeth or gums. These effects are temporary and can be avoided or minimized by brushing the child's teeth <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> rinsing the mouth with water after administration of the drops. Liquid iron may also stain fingernails if the child places his or hand in their mouth after iron administration.</p><p>Iron therapy appears to have mixed effects on immune function and susceptibility to infection. There is no evidence that iron supplementation increases the risk for infection, with the possible exception of special populations in which malaria is endemic if initiated during high-transmission seasons.

Infants should not be given low-iron formula or unmodified cow's milk. Feeding of infants with unmodified cow's milk (rather than formula or breastfeeding) may increase the risk for cow's milk protein-induced colitis with resultant intestinal blood loss. The resulting iron deficiency is exacerbated by lack of iron fortification in unmodified cow's milk. A cow's milk-based formula is acceptable if there is no evidence of cow's milk protein-induced colitis.

Additional testing should be performed about three months after initiation of iron therapy, including a CBC, Hgb, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), and red blood cell distribution width (RDW). Measurement of serum ferritin concentration also may be helpful to determine the need for further iron therapy to replenish iron stores. </p><p>In general, we suggest continuing iron therapy for about one month after all CBC parameters have normalized (Hgb, MCV, and RDW), to permit replenishment of iron stores. Early discontinuation of iron therapy frequently leads to recurrent IDA.

The clinician should interview the parent to determine whether the supplement has been given at the appropriate dose and timing, whether the appropriate diet modifications have been made, and if there has been any significant intercurrent illness (which might cause a transient decrease in Hgb).</p><p>If the patient has indeed been taking an appropriate dose of iron and has not had an intercurrent illness, we suggest the following additional evaluation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Evaluation of anemia &ndash; The three most common causes of microcytic anemia in children are IDA, alpha or beta thalassemia trait, and anemia of chronic inflammation (also known as anemia of chronic disease) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F65701\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65701 \">table 4</a>). These conditions can be assessed by measuring serum ferritin, Hgb electrophoresis (to assess for beta thalassemia trait), and C-reactive protein (CRP), respectively. Newborn screening results should be reviewed to determine whether any abnormal Hgb were present. Elevated levels of Hgb Barts or Hgb H suggest the possibility of a form of alpha thalassemia. Alpha thalassemia trait (also known as alpha thalassemia minima) cannot be detected by hemoglobin electrophoresis after the newborn period. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-the-thalassemias\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of the thalassemias&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In children with both thalassemia trait (alpha or beta) and iron deficiency, sufficient treatment of the iron deficiency is necessary to ensure accurate Hgb electrophoresis results. Rare genetic mutations that interfere with iron transport result in a moderate to severe anemia that has hematologic parameters identical to IDA but is refractory to iron supplementation; this condition is termed iron refractory iron deficiency anemia (IRIDA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-deficiency-in-infants-and-children-less-than12-years-treatment/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-and-diagnosis-of-iron-deficiency-and-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-adults#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes and diagnosis of iron deficiency and iron deficiency anemia in adults&quot;, section on 'Inherited disorders/IRIDA'</a>). After other more common causes of anemia are excluded, the possibility of IRIDA can be explored by genetic testing or, for less cost, by an oral iron absorption test [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-deficiency-in-infants-and-children-less-than12-years-treatment/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

If the results are positive, additional screening for common causes of gastrointestinal blood loss is appropriate, as outlined below. Of note, oral iron supplements do not cause false positive results of the more current generation of tests for occult blood in stool (Hemoccult II, Hemocullt Sensa, and HemoQuant) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-deficiency-in-infants-and-children-less-than12-years-treatment/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>] and, therefore, iron supplementation should not be stopped prior to such testing. This can be done before or after referral to a pediatric gastroenterologist. The following disorders should be considered, depending on the patient's age and characteristics (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lower-gastrointestinal-bleeding-in-children-causes-and-diagnostic-approach\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lower gastrointestinal bleeding in children: Causes and diagnostic approach&quot;</a>):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Cow's milk protein-induced colitis &ndash; This is a common cause of occult or overt fecal blood loss in infants and should be considered for any infant whose diet includes cow's milk protein (through breast milk, cow's milk-based formula, or solid foods). It is most likely to be induced by feeding of unmodified cow's milk but can also occur in breastfed infants whose mother's diet includes cow's milk, or in infants fed cow's milk-based formulas. The colitis generally responds to elimination of all milk protein from the diet of the infant and from the mother's diet if the infant is breastfed.

Most children with IBD are diagnosed in late childhood or adolescence but a few present in early childhood or even infancy. Measurement of a CBC, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), CRP, and serum albumin serve as an initial screen.

Another report demonstrated its safe and effective use in children with IBD and other gastrointestinal conditions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-deficiency-in-infants-and-children-less-than12-years-treatment/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. </p><p/><p>Response to treatment with IV iron may be assessed in the same manner as that of oral iron therapy. (See <a href=\"#H17787321\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up assessment for response'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17785825\"><span class=\"h1\">BLOOD TRANSFUSION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transfusion therapy is appropriate for selected children with severe iron deficiency anemia (IDA; hemoglobin [Hgb] concentration is &lt;5 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL),</span> <strong>if</strong> there is clinical evidence of distress (heart rate greater than <span class=\"nowrap\">160/min,</span> respiratory rate greater than <span class=\"nowrap\">30/min,</span> lethargy, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> not feeding well). These symptomatic patients are presumed to be at risk for serious short-term morbidity and mortality, such as cardiac failure or stroke, which could be prevented by judicious transfusion. In this setting, transfusions should be administered with caution to avoid fluid overload and heart failure, giving transfusion volumes of 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/kg</span> over three to four hours.

A 3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ferrous-sulfate-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ferrous sulfate</a> is generally effective and is tolerated by most children. For maximum absorption, the iron should be given 30 to 45 minutes before meals or two hours after meals, and only with juice or water. Administration with food or milk should be avoided. (See <a href=\"#H17787086\" class=\"local\">'Dose and scheduling'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Meanwhile, the following dietary goals should be implemented to prevent recurrence (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F114486\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef114486 \">table 2</a>) (see <a href=\"#H17787352\" class=\"local\">'Dietary changes'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Infants younger than 12 months of age should be fed with breast milk or iron-fortified formula. A cow's milk-based formula is acceptable if there is no evidence of cow's milk protein-induced colitis. Infants should not be given low-iron formula or unmodified cow's milk.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For patients six months and older, especially breastfed infants, ensure adequate consumption of iron in complementary foods. These include infant cereals, which are fortified with iron, foods rich in vitamin C, and pureed meats.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For children older than 12 months of age, intake of cow's milk should be limited to less than 20 oz per day and bottle feeding should be discontinued to limit milk intake. Excessive intake of cow's milk is the primary reason for the development of IDA in this age group and can be associated with occult intestinal blood loss. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After beginning therapeutic iron, perform follow-up testing to determine the response, consisting of a complete blood count (CBC) or hemoglobin (Hgb). The testing should be performed when the child is healthy, about four weeks after beginning iron therapy for children with mild anemia, or one to two weeks after beginning iron therapy in those with moderate to severe anemia. Follow-up is essential to confirm that the anemia was due to iron deficiency and to ensure that it is adequately treated. This is particularly important because of the effects of iron deficiency on neurodevelopment. (See <a href=\"#H17787321\" class=\"local\">'Follow-up assessment for response'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If the Hgb has increased by 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL,</span> therapy is continued, and the CBC is retested at three months to ensure that the Hgb and other parameters reach the age-adjusted normal range. Oral iron therapy should be continued for at least one month after the Hgb reaches the normal range for age, to ensure that iron stores are replenished. A serum ferritin concentration can also be measured to check iron stores prior to discontinuation of iron therapy. (See <a href=\"#H1951578767\" class=\"local\">'Responders'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26833987\"><span class=\"h2\">Further evaluation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients who do not demonstrate an adequate response within four weeks of initiating iron therapy should be reevaluated. Potential causes of recurrent or refractory IDA include ineffective treatment (nonadherence or incorrect dosing), an incorrect diagnosis, or ongoing blood loss or malabsorption (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F101076\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101076 \">table 3</a>). Our approach is as follows:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Interview the parent to determine whether the iron therapy has been given at the appropriate dose and timing, whether the appropriate diet modifications have been made, and if there has been any significant intercurrent illness (which might cause a transient decrease in Hgb). The most common reason for failure is that the treatment plan was not correctly followed. (See <a href=\"#H26833898\" class=\"local\">'Nonresponders'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the patient has indeed been taking an appropriate dose of iron and has not had an intercurrent illness, perform additional laboratory tests to rule out conditions that might simulate or complicate IDA such as thalassemia trait or anemia of chronic disease (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F65701\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65701 \">table 4</a>). In addition, several stool samples should be tested for occult blood. If the results are positive, additional screening should be performed for common causes of gastrointestinal blood loss, including cow's milk protein-induced colitis in infants, and celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in older children. (See <a href=\"#H26833898\" class=\"local\">'Nonresponders'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H75109761\"><span class=\"h2\">Refractory iron deficiency anemia</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intravenous iron therapy may be warranted for patients with severe or persistent anemia who have proven oral iron intolerance, malabsorption, or nonadherence despite family education and support to optimize oral therapy. Several forms of intravenous (IV) iron therapy with good safety profiles are available. Selection among these options may depend on relative costs and availability, time required for administration, and maximum permissible dose per infusion. (See <a href=\"#H17785811\" class=\"local\">'Intravenous iron therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/iron-deficiency-in-infants-and-children-less-than12-years-treatment/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Stoltzfus RJ.
