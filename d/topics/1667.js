Transmission rarely occurs via blood transfusion, organ transplantation, and congenitally. <em>Babesia</em> protozoa invade and cause lysis of red blood cells in mammalian hosts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/babesiosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p><em>Babesia microti</em> is the primary agent of human babesiosis in the United States, particularly in the Northeast and upper Midwest where it is endemic. Nearly all cases in Europe have been attributed to <em>Babesia divergens</em>,<em> </em>but the infection is sporadic. <em>Babesia venatorum</em> is endemic in northeastern China.</p><p>The treatment and prevention of babesiosis will be reviewed here. The clinical manifestations, diagnosis, microbiology, epidemiology, and pathogenesis of babesiosis are discussed separately.

Three months after completion of therapy, no parasites were seen by microscopy and no <em>Babesia</em> DNA was detectable by PCR in any patient. Atovaquone plus azithromycin was associated with less frequent adverse effects than clindamycin plus quinine (15 versus 72 percent, respectively). Adverse effects associated with atovaquone plus azithromycin include diarrhea and rash. Adverse effects associated with clindamycin plus quinine include diarrhea, rash, and symptoms of cinchonism (eg, tinnitus, decreased hearing, and vertigo); these prompted dose reduction or drug discontinuation in one-third of cases. Both azithromycin and quinine can produce QT prolongation and cardiac arrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/babesiosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Symptoms usually begin to improve within 48 hours of initiating antimicrobial therapy and resolve within one to two weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/babesiosis-treatment-and-prevention/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].
