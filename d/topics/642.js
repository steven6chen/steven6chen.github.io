Standard approaches to the initial treatment with ADT include orchiectomy, a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist, or a combination of a GnRH agonist plus an antiandrogen (combined androgen blockade). </p><p>Despite initial response rates of 80 to 90 percent, nearly all men eventually develop castration-resistant disease. Patients who develop progressive disease after their initial ADT are considered to have castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), although their disease may respond to secondary endocrine therapies. In this setting, two new agents, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abiraterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abiraterone</a> (an inhibitor of androgen synthesis) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=enzalutamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">enzalutamide</a> (a potent and selective inhibitor of the androgen receptor), have been shown to prolong overall survival and are the preferred systemic therapy when endocrine therapy is indicated (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F85716\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85716 \">table 1</a>).

However, these approaches may induce clinical responses or stable disease. These alternative endocrine therapies are often used sequentially and may be useful in postponing interventions such as chemotherapy, with its associated toxicity, or after chemotherapy when no other effective options are available. </p><p>These alternative endocrine approaches are discussed in this topic.</p><p>Overviews of the management of advanced castration-sensitive prostate cancer and CRPC are presented separately.

Antiandrogens may be used as the initial treatment in men with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC), or they may be used sequentially after newer agents that have been demonstrated to increase overall survival (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F85716\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85716 \">table 1</a>). Antiandrogens are also sometimes used as part of a combined androgen blockade for the initial treatment of men with advanced prostate cancer.

All of the antiandrogens have side effects related to the deprivation of androgen effect. These include loss of libido, impotence, hot flashes, and breast tenderness <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> gynecomastia.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=flutamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Flutamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bicalutamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bicalutamide</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nilutamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nilutamide</a> are often rotated and used sequentially when progressive disease occurs, based upon the assumption that specific antiandrogens interact differently with the androgen receptor. The potential utility of switching antiandrogens was illustrated by a retrospective series of 232 patients who progressed after initial treatment with combined androgen blockade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alternative-endocrine-therapies-for-castration-resistant-prostate-cancer/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. After observation for an antiandrogen response, patients were treated with an alternative nonsteroidal antiandrogen. Overall, a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) decrease &ge;50 percent was observed in 36 percent of patients, and a PSA decrease &lt;50 percent was seen in another 25 percent.

Flutamide has a half-life of approximately five hours and is almost completely excreted in the urine. In addition to its antiandrogenic side effects, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting are relatively frequent side effects. Although hepatotoxicity is uncommon, it can be fatal; serum aminotransferases should be closely monitored during therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alternative-endocrine-therapies-for-castration-resistant-prostate-cancer/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p>The limited efficacy of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flutamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flutamide</a> is illustrated by a trial conducted by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) in which 201 men were randomly assigned to either flutamide (250 mg three times daily) or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> (5 mg four times daily) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/alternative-endocrine-therapies-for-castration-resistant-prostate-cancer/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].

Ketoconazole is less specific than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=abiraterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">abiraterone</a>, which is also an inhibitor of steroid hormone synthesis. However, it may retain a role in some patients given its much lower cost. Treatment with ketoconazole is generally initiated after allowing for a potential response from the withdrawal of an antiandrogen.

In addition, antacids, proton pump inhibitors, and histamine H2-receptor antagonists should be avoided, if possible.

Despite high response rates to the initial hormone therapy, nearly all men eventually develop progressive castration-resistant disease. Subsequent management utilizes sequential application of various treatments. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=castration-resistant-prostate-cancer-treatments-targeting-the-androgen-pathway\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Castration-resistant prostate cancer: Treatments targeting the androgen pathway&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) whose initial hormonal therapy included medical orchiectomy, we suggest that the gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonist or antagonist be continued throughout subsequent therapies so as to maintain suppression of testicular androgen production (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Continuation of ADT'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A number of newer approaches have demonstrated improved overall survival in men with CRPC, but these have not been compared with each other in randomized clinical trials (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ONC%2F85716\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85716 \">table 1</a>). The optimal sequencing of these therapies and their timing relative to older endocrine approaches remain uncertain.

The most common and least controversial use of alternative androgen-receptor-directed therapies is in patients with biochemical progression following androgen ablation in whom standard imaging shows minimal or no disease. While active surveillance is appropriate in such patients, many have biochemical responses to less potent androgen-receptor-directed agents (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bicalutamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bicalutamide</a>), with unknown long-term clinical benefit.
