In hypertensive adults, multiple randomized trials have shown that reduction of blood pressure (BP) by antihypertensive therapy reduces cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Based upon these observations, identifying children with HTN and successfully treating their HTN should have an important impact on long-term outcomes of CVD.

Children should be instructed to participate in moderate to vigorous activity for 30 to 60 minutes sessions for at least 3 to 5 days per week. An expert panel sponsored by the United States National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) has developed age-based recommendations for daily physical activity for children (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F75748\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef75748 \">table 5</a>).</p><p>Data has shown short-term physical activity leads to a small but not significant reduction of BP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/nonemergent-treatment-of-hypertension-in-children-and-adolescents/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

In particular, there appears to be a greater benefit in salt restriction for African-Americans and patients with established HTN or renal insufficiency. Based on the available evidence, the 2017 AAP guidelines recommend that dietary sodium be restricted to &lt;2300 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>.

This also includes a reduction in or elimination of foods containing large amounts of salt (eg, potato chips, pretzels, processed foods). Parents and care providers are encouraged to read food package labels to determine the sodium content of prepared foods and avoid those with high salt content. In addition, lunches provided by school programs need to be evaluated to ensure avoiding foods with high salt content.
