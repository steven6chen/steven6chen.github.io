The renal injury induced by these drugs is related to their preferential accumulation in the renal cortex. After administration, up to 5 to 10 percent of the parenteral dose is retained in the renal cortex, where it can achieve concentrations greatly exceeding the concurrent serum concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-and-risk-factors-for-aminoglycoside-nephrotoxicity/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. This preferential sequestration of aminoglycosides in proximal tubule cells accounts for the observation that renal failure may become clinically apparent as late as several days after the drug has been discontinued. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-prevention-of-aminoglycoside-nephrotoxicity-and-ototoxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and prevention of aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The manifestations of and risk factors for aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity are reviewed here. Acute tubular necrosis due to ischemia or other insults and the pathogenesis and potential therapy of aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity are discussed separately.

The nonoliguric aspect of the renal failure is secondary to a loss in renal concentrating ability believed to be the result of distal tubular damage.</p><p>The acute tubular necrosis that occurs from aminoglycoside exposure is rarely severe, with incremental increases in the plasma creatinine that are usually mild (0.5 to 2.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [44 to 177 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/liter])</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-and-risk-factors-for-aminoglycoside-nephrotoxicity/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. However, aminoglycosides can result in toxicity, mandating renal replacement therapy in patients who already have chronic kidney disease (CKD). The urine sediment most commonly shows mild proteinuria, hyaline, and granular casts. The fractional excretion of sodium is generally above 1 percent (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-fractional-excretion-of-sodium\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 1</a>) or, for standard units, (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=calculator-fractional-excretion-of-sodium-si-units\" class=\"calc calc_professional\">calculator 2</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fractional-excretion-of-sodium-urea-and-other-molecules-in-acute-kidney-injury-acute-renal-failure\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fractional excretion of sodium, urea, and other molecules in acute kidney injury (acute renal failure)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Distal tubular dysfunction</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Distal nephron segments also can be affected in aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity. The two major manifestations of distal dysfunction are polyuria due to decreased concentrating ability and hypomagnesemia due to enhanced urinary losses (see next section) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-and-risk-factors-for-aminoglycoside-nephrotoxicity/abstract/1,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7</a>]. The polyuria is postulated to be secondary to the attenuation in the sensitivity of the collecting-duct epithelium to endogenous antidiuretic hormone in aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-and-risk-factors-for-aminoglycoside-nephrotoxicity/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Electrolyte abnormalities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypophosphatemia are infrequently observed. This is likely secondary to the decrement in proximal tubule transport that occurs during aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicity. A Fanconi-like syndrome can occur with glycosuria, aminoaciduria, phosphaturia, and uricosuria. The loss of phosphorus in the urine results in hypophosphatemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-and-risk-factors-for-aminoglycoside-nephrotoxicity/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. With aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity, magnesium depletion resulting in hypomagnesemia can lead to secondary hypokalemia and hypocalcemia.</p><p>Treatment of aminoglycoside-induced magnesium-wasting consists of the administration of oral or intravenous magnesium supplements. However, the efficacy of this oral regimen is limited by the urinary excretion of most of the extra magnesium. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-magnesium-depletion\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of magnesium depletion&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-treatment-of-hypomagnesemia\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and treatment of hypomagnesemia&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Course</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given that proximal tubules can regenerate, the usual course of aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity is one of recovery of renal function. The plasma creatinine concentration usually returns to the prior baseline level within 21 days after cessation of therapy. However, resolution of the acute episode may be delayed if the patient remains hypovolemic, septic, or catabolic; in these settings, tubular regeneration cannot occur.</p><p>Irreversible kidney damage is uncommon with acute aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity. However, it may occur with prolonged therapy, even in low doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-and-risk-factors-for-aminoglycoside-nephrotoxicity/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Studies in other forms of reversible acute kidney injury suggest that normalization of the plasma creatinine concentration and even the glomerular filtration rate may not reflect complete recovery. Irreversible nephron loss in this setting may be masked by compensatory hyperfiltration in the remaining normal glomeruli. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=kidney-and-patient-outcomes-after-acute-kidney-injury-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Kidney and patient outcomes after acute kidney injury in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although a pattern of a nonoliguric acute kidney injury five to seven days after aminoglycoside exposure is suggestive, differentiating aminoglycoside-induced acute kidney injury from other etiologies of acute tubular necrosis can be difficult given that it often occurs in the setting of significant comorbid conditions, sepsis, and concomitant nephrotoxin exposure. In addition, acute kidney injury is frequently multifactorial, and aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity is only one of its components. An essential initial diagnostic step in the diagnosis of aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity is a careful history with attention to potentially reversible etiologies, such as reduced effective arterial volume or urinary tract obstruction. In addition, a review of all imaging procedures for intravenous contrast exposure and medications for concomitant nephrotoxin use is imperative.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several risk factors have been identified that increase the risk of aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-and-risk-factors-for-aminoglycoside-nephrotoxicity/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. The major risk factors are:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prolonged duration of therapy</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Advanced age</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Comorbid disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduced effective arterial volume</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sepsis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Concomitant medications</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Elevated plasma drug concentrations</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Type of aminoglycoside</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Frequency of dosing</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Prolonged duration of therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The development of renal insufficiency generally requires at least five to seven days of exposure to aminoglycosides in patients with normal hemodynamic status. Prolonged therapy increases the risk that toxic aminoglycoside concentrations will develop and persist in the renal cortex.</p><p>For any given aminoglycoside, a direct relationship exists between serum concentrations of aminoglycosides, renal cortical concentrations, and nephrotoxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-and-risk-factors-for-aminoglycoside-nephrotoxicity/abstract/1,9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9,10</a>]. Owing to the renal cortical sequestration of aminoglycosides, the risk of aminoglycoside-induced nephrotoxicity is also increased in patients given the drug in repeated courses separated by a few days or weeks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-and-risk-factors-for-aminoglycoside-nephrotoxicity/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In contrast, renal cortical accumulation is less when aminoglycosides are given as one large, daily dose, as in once-daily dosing programs, because of the saturable nature of the renal cortical uptake [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-and-risk-factors-for-aminoglycoside-nephrotoxicity/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dosing-and-administration-of-parenteral-aminoglycosides#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dosing and administration of parenteral aminoglycosides&quot;, section on 'Nephrotoxicity'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Advanced age</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Advanced age has long been held to be an important risk factor in the development of aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-and-risk-factors-for-aminoglycoside-nephrotoxicity/abstract/12-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-16</a>]. This increased risk is postulated to be secondary to the impaired capacity for cellular repair and regeneration found in this patient population. In addition, advanced age may result in excessive dosing of aminoglycosides from an overestimation of creatinine clearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-and-risk-factors-for-aminoglycoside-nephrotoxicity/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Comorbid disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of comorbid conditions are associated with aminoglycoside-induced kidney disease. Diabetes mellitus and leukemia, for example, increase the risk for aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-and-risk-factors-for-aminoglycoside-nephrotoxicity/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>Early studies of aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity reported increased risk of aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). In these studies, however, aminoglycoside concentrations were not pharmacokinetically adjusted, and patients were likely exposed to high serum levels of aminoglycosides with associated nephrotoxicity. Interestingly, subsequent studies showed that patients with higher creatinine clearances were associated with an increased risk of nephrotoxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-and-risk-factors-for-aminoglycoside-nephrotoxicity/abstract/2,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,12</a>].</p><p>Overall, patients with CKD are at increased risk for aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity because the risk of inadvertent overdosing is greater than in patients with normal renal function. This increased risk is due to the imprecision of our bedside tools in estimating renal function and aminoglycoside dosing. Furthermore, patients with CKD have less renal reserve and an attenuated ability to recover from aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity.</p><p>Among patients with advanced liver disease, activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system may play a pathogenetic role in increasing the risk of aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-and-risk-factors-for-aminoglycoside-nephrotoxicity/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In addition, obstructive jaundice with a plasma bilirubin concentration above 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (85 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> is associated with an increased risk of aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-and-risk-factors-for-aminoglycoside-nephrotoxicity/abstract/2,17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,17,18</a>]. How obstructive jaundice increases the sensitivity to aminoglycoside toxicity is not known, but either bilirubin or endotoxin (which is absorbed because of decreased bile salt entry into the intestinal lumen) may be involved [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-and-risk-factors-for-aminoglycoside-nephrotoxicity/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. The hypoalbuminemia frequently observed in advanced liver disease is also an independent risk factor for aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Reduced effective volume</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Reduced effective volume results in decreased renal perfusion, renal ischemia, and greatly enhances the risk of aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-and-risk-factors-for-aminoglycoside-nephrotoxicity/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. This can occur in the clinical setting of intravascular volume depletion, heart failure, sepsis, and advanced liver disease. Moreover, renal ischemia appears to accelerate the time course for aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity.</p><p>Two factors have been postulated to mediate this synergism between the aminoglycoside and renal ischemia:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The aminoglycoside interferes with cell energetics, thereby increasing the susceptibility to renal injury during an ischemic episode [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-and-risk-factors-for-aminoglycoside-nephrotoxicity/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. This synergism is most prominent in the S3 segment of the proximal tubule; this segment is particularly sensitive to ischemic injury secondary to minimal reperfusion resulting in continuing hypoxia to the area.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ischemia alters membrane lipids. In particular, there is enhanced phosphatidylinositol (PI) content in the luminal membrane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-and-risk-factors-for-aminoglycoside-nephrotoxicity/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. This results in increased aminoglycoside binding, uptake, and accumulation in the proximal tubular cells of S1, S2, and S3 segments since filtered cationic <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a> binds to PI and other acidic phospholipids and is then internalized by endocytosis. This charge interaction has important implications for the development and possible prevention of aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-prevention-of-aminoglycoside-nephrotoxicity-and-ototoxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and prevention of aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Sepsis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to volume depletion, as described above, endotoxin also enhances the nephrotoxicity of the aminoglycosides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-and-risk-factors-for-aminoglycoside-nephrotoxicity/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Although decreased renal perfusion due to renal vasoconstriction may play a contributory role, endotoxin also appears to be associated with enhanced drug accumulation in the tubules. How this occurs is not known. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-and-etiology-of-ischemic-acute-tubular-necrosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis and etiology of ischemic acute tubular necrosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Concomitant medications</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Administration of potentially nephrotoxic medications with aminoglycosides places a patient at increased risk for nephrotoxicity. Implicated medications include <a href=\"topic.htm?path=furosemide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">furosemide</a>, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clindamycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">clindamycin</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vancomycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">vancomycin</a>&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-and-risk-factors-for-aminoglycoside-nephrotoxicity/abstract/1,2,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2,15,16</a>].</p><p>Initial studies suggested that cephalothin increased the nephrotoxicity of the aminoglycosides [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-and-risk-factors-for-aminoglycoside-nephrotoxicity/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. However, patients with sepsis or hypotension were excluded. In this limited population, cephalothin did have a potentiating effect, but the renal injury was mild, with the plasma creatinine concentration remaining below 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (176 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> in almost all patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-and-risk-factors-for-aminoglycoside-nephrotoxicity/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>In comparison, there seemed to be no increase in toxic effects when all treated patients are included, which more closely simulates the real world [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-and-risk-factors-for-aminoglycoside-nephrotoxicity/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Furthermore, it is unclear if the initial results with cephalothin can be extrapolated to any of the other cephalosporin-type drugs. Evidence suggests that this probably does not occur and that the cephalosporins can be safely given in conjunction with an aminoglycoside [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-and-risk-factors-for-aminoglycoside-nephrotoxicity/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Although it seems likely that cephalosporins do not have a major effect on aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity, there is suggestive evidence that concurrent administration of a penicillin may actually be protective [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-and-risk-factors-for-aminoglycoside-nephrotoxicity/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. How this occurs is not known, but decreased tubular uptake of the aminoglycoside may be involved. It must be emphasized, however, that penicillins, particularly carbenicillin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=piperacillin-united-states-not-available-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">piperacillin</a>, and ticarcillin, can physically complex with the aminoglycosides; as a result, these agents cannot be mixed in the same intravenous infusion.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Elevated plasma drug concentrations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Careful monitoring of plasma levels is an important component of aminoglycoside therapy. Impaired renal function can occur even with perfect control of the plasma level since renal cortical aminoglycoside accumulation increases with time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-and-risk-factors-for-aminoglycoside-nephrotoxicity/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. However, the risk is much greater in patients receiving divided-dose aminoglycoside therapy who develop high peak plasma drug levels (&gt;10 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL</span> for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gentamicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gentamicin</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tobramycin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tobramycin</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-and-risk-factors-for-aminoglycoside-nephrotoxicity/abstract/1,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,28</a>]. In addition, elevated trough levels (&gt;2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/mL)</span> have been associated with nephrotoxicity in a once-daily aminoglycoside dosing program of an older cohort of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-and-risk-factors-for-aminoglycoside-nephrotoxicity/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Remarkably, whether an elevated trough or peak level contributes to the increased risk of nephrotoxicity with aminoglycosides is not fully elucidated. In one analysis, no causal relationship could be found between a serum peak or trough aminoglycoside level in several reviewed studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-and-risk-factors-for-aminoglycoside-nephrotoxicity/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>The therapeutic success observed with once-daily aminoglycoside programs with their associated supratherapeutic levels certainly casts doubt on whether a peak aminoglycoside level increases nephrotoxic risk in this clinical setting. However, an elevated trough level has been shown to increase the nephrotoxic risk in once-daily aminoglycoside programs in older adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-and-risk-factors-for-aminoglycoside-nephrotoxicity/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Similarly, in another older patient cohort, an elevated peak level increased aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity with conventional dosing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-and-risk-factors-for-aminoglycoside-nephrotoxicity/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Although there remains uncertainty about whether peak or trough levels are primarily responsible for nephrotoxicity, serum monitoring of aminoglycosides is beneficial and recommended due to the following reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The limitations of our bedside estimates of glomerular filtration rates on which we base our aminoglycoside dosing are often imprecise.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monitoring programs ensure that less toxic antibiotics will be selected in patients with contraindications to aminoglycosides.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>These programs also ensure that appropriate, therapeutic doses of antibiotics are given earlier in a patient's therapy.</p><p/><p>Several researchers have demonstrated the benefits of pharmacokinetically monitoring aminoglycoside therapy. This is especially important since few patients have a known glomerular filtration rate allowing for appropriate modeling of the pharmacokinetics. Among the benefits cited were fewer instances of nephrotoxicity and treatment failure and shorter hospital stays [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-and-risk-factors-for-aminoglycoside-nephrotoxicity/abstract/30-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-33</a>].</p><p>Serum peak and trough levels should be measured periodically when conventional aminoglycoside dosing is used. Moreover, peak and trough monitoring in conventional dosing is imperative in older and obese patients. In contrast, once-daily aminoglycoside programs only require a periodic trough level. This trough level is used to determine the timing of the next dose of aminoglycoside.

This is supported by the favorable clinical data observed with the once-daily aminoglycoside dosing programs. In once-daily aminoglycoside therapy, a much larger loading dose is given every 24 to 48 hours. The rationale for this approach is to exploit the concentration-dependent bactericidal activity and postantibiotic effect of aminoglycosides. This approach to aminoglycoside dosing has demonstrated improved clinical efficacy and reduced nephrotoxicity relative to conventional aminoglycoside dosing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-and-risk-factors-for-aminoglycoside-nephrotoxicity/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. This is discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dosing-and-administration-of-parenteral-aminoglycosides#H374424323\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dosing and administration of parenteral aminoglycosides&quot;, section on 'Traditional versus extended-interval dosing'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute kidney injury from aminoglycoside exposure typically manifests after five to seven days of therapy. The nonoliguric aspect of the renal failure is secondary to a loss in renal concentrating ability believed to be the result of distal tubular damage. The acute tubular necrosis that occurs from aminoglycoside exposure is rarely severe. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Nonoliguric acute kidney injury'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypomagnesemia, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, and hypophosphatemia are infrequently observed. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Electrolyte abnormalities'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Given that proximal tubules can regenerate, the usual course of aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity is one of recovery of renal function. The plasma creatinine concentration usually returns to the prior baseline level within 21 days after cessation of therapy. However, resolution of the acute episode may be delayed. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Course'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Several risk factors have been identified that increase the risk of aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity. The major risk factors are prolonged duration of therapy, advanced age, comorbid disease, reduced effective arterial volume, sepsis, concomitant medications, elevated plasma drug concentrations, type of aminoglycoside, and frequency of dosing. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Risk factors'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/manifestations-of-and-risk-factors-for-aminoglycoside-nephrotoxicity/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Humes HD.
