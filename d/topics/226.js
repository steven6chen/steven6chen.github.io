The diagnostic evaluation and management of appendicitis in adults and appendicitis in pregnancy and children are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-appendicitis-in-adults-diagnostic-evaluation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute appendicitis in adults: Diagnostic evaluation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-acute-appendicitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of acute appendicitis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-appendicitis-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute appendicitis in pregnancy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-appendicitis-in-children-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute appendicitis in children: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The vermiform appendix is located at the base of the cecum, near the ileocecal valve where the taenia coli converge on the cecum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F64911\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64911 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. The appendix is a true diverticulum of the cecum. In contrast to acquired diverticular disease, which consists of a protuberance of a subset of the enteric wall layers, the appendiceal wall contains all of the layers of the colonic wall: mucosa, submucosa, muscularis (longitudinal and circular), and the serosal covering [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>The appendiceal orifice opens into the cecum. Its blood supply, the appendiceal artery, is a terminal branch of the ileocolic artery, which traverses the length of the mesoappendix and terminates at the tip of the organ (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F73756\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef73756 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>The attachment of the appendix to the base of the cecum is constant. However, the tip may migrate to the retrocecal, subcecal, preileal, postileal, and pelvic positions. These normal anatomic variations can complicate the diagnosis as the site of pain and findings on the clinical examination will reflect the anatomic position of the appendix.</p><p>The presence of B and T lymphoid cells in the mucosa and submucosa of the lamina propria make the appendix histologically distinct from the cecum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. These cells create a lymphoid pulp that aids immunologic function by increasing lymphoid products such as IgA and operating as part of the gut-associated lymphoid tissue system [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Lymphoid hyperplasia can cause obstruction of the appendix and lead to appendicitis. The lymphoid tissue undergoes atrophy with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5346248\"><span class=\"h1\">EPIDEMIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Appendicitis occurs most frequently in the second and third decades of life. The incidence is approximately <span class=\"nowrap\">233/100,000</span> population and is highest in the 10 to 19 year-old age group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. It is also higher among men (male to female ratio of 1.4:1), who have a lifetime incidence of 8.6 percent compared with 6.7 percent for women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The natural history of appendicitis is similar to that of other inflammatory processes involving hollow visceral organs. Initial inflammation of the appendiceal wall is followed by localized ischemia, perforation, and the development of a contained abscess or generalized peritonitis.</p><p>Appendiceal obstruction has been proposed as the primary cause of appendicitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/3,8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,8-11</a>]. Obstruction is frequently implicated but not always identified. A study of patients with appendicitis showed that there was elevated intraluminal pressure in only one-third of the patients with nonperforated appendicitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>Appendiceal obstruction may be caused by fecaliths (hard fecal masses), calculi, lymphoid hyperplasia, infectious processes, and benign or malignant tumors. However, some patients with a fecalith have a histologically normal appendix and the majority of patients with appendicitis do not have a fecalith [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>].</p><p>When obstruction of the appendix is the cause of appendicitis, the obstruction leads to an increase in luminal and intramural pressure, resulting in thrombosis and occlusion of the small vessels in the appendiceal wall, and stasis of lymphatic flow. As the appendix becomes engorged, the visceral afferent nerve fibers entering the spinal cord at T8-T10 are stimulated, leading to vague central or periumbilical abdominal pain [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Well-localized pain occurs later in the course when inflammation involves the adjacent parietal peritoneum.</p><p>The mechanism of luminal obstruction varies depending upon the patient's age. In the young, lymphoid follicular hyperplasia due to infection is thought to be the main cause. In older patients, luminal obstruction is more likely to be caused by fibrosis, fecaliths, or neoplasia (carcinoid, adenocarcinoma, or mucocele). In endemic areas, parasites can cause obstruction in any age group. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-of-the-appendix-and-pseudomyxoma-peritonei\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cancer of the appendix and pseudomyxoma peritonei&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Once obstructed, the lumen becomes filled with mucus and distends, increasing luminal and intramural pressure. This results in thrombosis and occlusion of the small vessels, and stasis of lymphatic flow. As lymphatic and vascular compromise progress, the wall of the appendix becomes ischemic and then necrotic.</p><p>Bacterial overgrowth occurs within the diseased appendix. Aerobic organisms predominate early in the course, while mixed infection is more common in late appendicitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Common organisms involved in gangrenous and perforated appendicitis include Escherichia coli, Peptostreptococcus, Bacteroides fragilis, and Pseudomonas species [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Intraluminal bacteria subsequently invade the appendiceal wall and further propagate a neutrophilic exudate. The influx of neutrophils causes a fibropurulent reaction on the serosal surface, irritating the surrounding parietal peritoneum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This results in stimulation of somatic nerves, causing pain at the site of peritoneal irritation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>During the first 24 hours after symptoms develop, approximately 90 percent of patients develop inflammation and perhaps necrosis of the appendix, but not perforation. The type of luminal obstruction may be a predictor of perforation of an acutely inflamed appendix. Fecaliths were six times more common than true calculi in the appendix, but calculi were more often associated with perforated appendicitis or periappendiceal abscess (45 percent) than were fecaliths (19 percent). This is presumably due to the rigidity of true calculi as compared with the softer, more crushable fecaliths [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. </p><p>Once significant inflammation and necrosis occur, the appendix is at risk of perforation, which leads to localized abscess formation or diffuse peritonitis. The time course to perforation is variable. One study showed that 20 percent of patients developed perforation less than 24 hours after the onset of symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Sixty-five percent of patients in whom the appendix perforated had symptoms for longer than 48 hours.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5345937\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5345945\"><span class=\"h2\">Clinical manifestations</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5346470\"><span class=\"h3\">History</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Abdominal pain is the most common symptom, and is reported in nearly all confirmed cases of appendicitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. The clinical presentation of acute appendicitis is described as a constellation of the following classic symptoms:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Right lower quadrant (right anterior iliac fossa) abdominal pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Anorexia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Nausea and vomiting</p><p/><p>In the classic presentation, the patient describes the onset of abdominal pain as the first symptom. The pain is typically periumbilical in nature with subsequent migration to the right lower quadrant as the inflammation progresses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Although considered a classic symptom, migratory pain occurs only in 50 to 60 percent of patients with appendicitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/8,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,20</a>]. Nausea and vomiting, if they occur, usually follow the onset of pain. Fever-related symptoms generally occur later in the course of illness. </p><p>In many patients, initial features are atypical or nonspecific, and can include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Indigestion</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Flatulence</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bowel irregularity</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diarrhea</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Generalized malaise</p><p/><p>Because the early symptoms of appendicitis are often subtle, patients and clinicians may minimize their importance. The symptoms of appendicitis vary depending upon the location of the tip of the appendix (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F64911\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64911 \">figure 1</a>) (see <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Anatomy'</a> above). For example, an inflamed anterior appendix produces marked, localized pain in the right lower quadrant, while a retrocecal appendix may cause a dull abdominal ache [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The location of the pain may also be atypical in patients who have the tip of the appendix located in the pelvis, which can cause tenderness below McBurney's point. Such patients may complain of urinary frequency and dysuria or rectal symptoms, such as tenesmus and diarrhea.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5346477\"><span class=\"h3\">Physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The early signs of appendicitis are often subtle. Low-grade fever reaching 101.0&deg;F (38.3&deg;C) may be present. The physical examination may be unrevealing in the very early stages of appendicitis since the visceral organs are not innervated with somatic pain fibers. </p><p>However, as the inflammation progresses, involvement of the overlying parietal peritoneum causes localized tenderness in the right lower quadrant and can be detected on the abdominal examination. Rectal examination, although often advocated, has not been shown to provide additional diagnostic information in cases of appendicitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In women, right adnexal area tenderness may be present on pelvic examination, and differentiating between tenderness of pelvic origin versus that of appendicitis may be challenging. High-grade fever (&gt;101.<span class=\"nowrap\">0&deg;F/38</span>.3&deg;C) occurs as inflammation progresses. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-abdominal-pain-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of abdominal pain in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Patients with a retrocecal appendix may not exhibit marked localized tenderness in the right lower quadrant since the appendix does not come into contact with the anterior parietal peritoneum (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F64911\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef64911 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. The rectal <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pelvic examination is more likely to elicit positive signs than the abdominal examination. Tenderness may be more prominent on pelvic examination, and may be mistaken for adnexal tenderness. </p><p>Several findings on physical examination have been described to facilitate diagnosis, but these findings pre-dated definitive imaging for appendicitis, and the wide variation in their sensitivity and specificity suggests that they be used with caution to broaden, or narrow, a differential diagnosis. There are no physical findings, taken alone or in concert, that definitively confirm a diagnosis of appendicitis. </p><p>Commonly described physical signs include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>McBurney's point tenderness is described as maximal tenderness at 1.5 to 2 inches from the anterior superior iliac spine (ASIS) on a straight line from the ASIS to the umbilicus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>] (sensitivity 50 to 94 percent; specificity 75 to 86 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rovsing's sign refers to pain in the right lower quadrant with palpation of the left lower quadrant. This sign is also called indirect tenderness and is indicative of right-sided local peritoneal irritation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>] (sensitivity 22 to 68 percent; specificity 58 to 96 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/25,28-30\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,28-30</a>]).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The psoas sign is associated with a retrocecal appendix. This is manifested by right lower quadrant pain with passive right hip extension. The inflamed appendix may lie against the right psoas muscle, causing the patient to shorten the muscle by drawing up the right knee. Passive extension of the iliopsoas muscle with hip extension causes right lower quadrant pain (sensitivity 13 to 42 percent; specificity 79 to 97 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/28,31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,31,32</a>]).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The obturator sign is associated with a pelvic appendix. This test is based on the principle that the inflamed appendix may lay against the right obturator internus muscle. When the clinician flexes the patient's right hip and knee followed by internal rotation of the right hip, this elicits right lower quadrant pain, (sensitivity 8 percent; specificity 94 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]).

Right-sided diverticulitis occurs in only 1.5 percent of patients in Western countries, but is more common in Asian populations (accounting for as many as 75 percent of cases of diverticulitis). Patients with right-sided diverticulitis tend to be younger than those with left-sided disease and often are misdiagnosed with acute appendicitis. Computed tomographic (CT) scanning of the abdomen with IV and oral contrast is the diagnostic test of choice in patients suspected of having acute diverticulitis.

A Meckel's diverticulum is a congenital remnant of the omphalomesenteric duct and is located on the small intestine two feet from the ileocecal valve [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/acute-appendicitis-in-adults-clinical-manifestations-and-differential-diagnosis/abstract/48,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">48,49</a>]. Meckel's diverticulitis should be included in the differential diagnosis, as the small bowel may migrate into the right lower quadrant and mimic the symptoms of appendicitis. If an inflamed appendix is not found on abdominal exploration for acute appendicitis, the surgeon should search for an inflamed Meckel's diverticulum. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meckels-diverticulum#H1124082204\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Meckel's diverticulum&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentations'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5348797\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute ileitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute ileitis, due most commonly to an acute self-limited bacterial infection (Yersinia, Campylobacter, Salmonella, and others), should be considered when acute diarrhea is a prominent symptom. Other clinical manifestations of acute yersiniosis include abdominal pain, fever, nausea <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> vomiting. Yersiniosis cannot be readily distinguished clinically from other causes of acute diarrhea that present with these symptoms. However, localization of abdominal pain to the right lower quadrant along with acute diarrhea may be a diagnostic clue for yersiniosis.

At surgery, findings include visible inflammation around the appendix and terminal ileum and inflammation of the mesenteric lymph nodes; the appendix itself is generally normal. Yersinia can be cultured from the appendix and involved lymph nodes.

Fatigue, prolonged diarrhea with abdominal pain, weight loss, and fever, with or without gross bleeding, are the hallmarks of Crohn's disease. An acute exacerbation of Crohn's disease can mimic acute appendicitis and may be indistinguishable by clinical evaluation and imaging.</p><p>Crohn's disease should be suspected in patients who have persistent pain after surgery, especially if the appendix is histologically normal.

These abscesses are found most commonly in reproductive age women and typically result from upper genital tract infection. Tubo-ovarian abscess is usually a complication of pelvic inflammatory disease. The classic presentation includes acute lower abdominal pain, fever, chills, and vaginal discharge. However, fever is not present in all patients, some patients report only low-grade nocturnal fevers or chills, and not all women present in an acute fashion. Clinical history and CT imaging can help differentiate TOA from acute appendicitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F60914\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef60914 \">picture 1</a>).

The recent onset of pain that worsens during coitus or with jarring movement may be the only presenting symptom of PID; the onset of pain during or shortly after menses is particularly suggestive. On physical examination, only approximately one-half of patients with PID have fever. Abdominal examination reveals diffuse tenderness greatest in the lower quadrants, which may or may not be symmetrical. Rebound tenderness and decreased bowel sounds are common. On pelvic examination, the finding of a purulent endocervical discharge <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> acute cervical motion and adnexal tenderness with bimanual examination is strongly suggestive of PID. Clinical history and CT imaging can help differentiate PID from acute appendicitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pelvic-inflammatory-disease-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pelvic inflammatory disease: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22672764\"><span class=\"h3\">Ruptured ovarian cyst</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rupture of an ovarian cyst is a common occurrence in women of reproductive age and may be associated with the sudden onset of unilateral lower abdominal pain. The right lower quadrant is most commonly affected, possibly because the rectosigmoid colon protects the left ovary from the effects of abdominal trauma. The pain often begins during strenuous physical activity, such as exercise or sexual intercourse, and may be accompanied by light vaginal bleeding due to a drop in secretion of ovarian hormones and subsequent endometrial sloughing. Blood from the rupture site may seep into the ovary, which can cause pain from stretching of the ovarian cortex, or it may flow into the abdomen, which has an irritant effect on the peritoneum. Serous or mucinous fluid released upon cyst rupture is not very irritating; the patient may remain asymptomatic despite accumulation of a large volume of intraperitoneal fluid. On the other hand, spillage of sebaceous material upon rupture of a dermoid cyst causes a marked granulomatous reaction and chemical peritonitis, which is usually quite painful. Intraabdominal hemorrhage may be associated with Cullen's sign (ie, periumbilical ecchymoses). Clinical history and CT imaging can help differentiate a ruptured ovarian cyst from acute appendicitis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F75150\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef75150 \">image 7</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F72345\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef72345 \">image 8</a>).

The pain is typically mild and unilateral; it occurs midway between menstrual periods and lasts for a few hours to a couple of days. Fluid or blood is released from the ruptured egg follicle and can cause irritation of the lining of the abdominal wall.

Isolated fallopian tube torsion is uncommon (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F82480\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef82480 \">picture 3</a>). Expedient diagnosis is important to preserve ovarian function and prevent adverse sequelae. However, the diagnosis can be challenging because the symptoms are relatively nonspecific. </p><p>The most common symptom of ovarian torsion is sudden onset lower abdominal pain, often associated with waves of nausea and vomiting. Fever, although an uncommon finding in ovarian torsion, may be a marker of necrosis, particularly in the setting of an increased white blood cell count.

There are often no abnormal findings on physical examination; when findings are present, the most common is tenderness upon palpation of the posterior fornix. Ultrasound is mostly useful for diagnosing ovarian endometriomas; it lacks adequate resolution for visualizing adhesions and superficial <span class=\"nowrap\">peritoneal/ovarian</span> implants, which are more common than endometriomas.

In women with acute pelvic pain or abnormal vaginal bleeding, a positive pregnancy test strongly suggests the presence of an ectopic pregnancy if an intrauterine pregnancy cannot be visualized sonographically. If an intrauterine pregnancy is visualized, then pelvic pain and intraperitoneal fluid could be due to a ruptured ovarian cyst (eg, corpus luteum cyst, theca lutein cyst) or heterotopic pregnancy.

Testicular torsion results from inadequate fixation of the testis to the tunica vaginalis. If fixation of the lower pole of the testis to the tunica vaginalis is insufficiently broad-based or absent, the testis may torse (twist) on the spermatic cord, potentially producing ischemia from reduced arterial inflow and venous outflow obstruction.

Several factors may predispose postpubertal boys to develop subacute epididymitis, including sexual activity, heavy physical exertion, and direct trauma (eg, bicycle or motorcycle riding). Bacterial epididymitis in prepubertal boys is associated with structural anomalies of the urinary tract. In acute infectious epididymitis, palpation reveals induration and swelling of the involved epididymis with exquisite tenderness. More advanced cases often present with testicular swelling and pain (epididymo-orchitis) with scrotal wall erythema and a reactive hydrocele.
