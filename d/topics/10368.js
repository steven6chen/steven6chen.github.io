The normal physiologic functions of the heart and lungs, including circulation of blood, oxygenation, and ventilation, are temporarily taken over by the CPB machine. Typically, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardioplegia-solution-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cardioplegia solution</a> is administered to allow the cardiac surgeon to operate on a nonbeating heart in a field largely devoid of blood, while other end organs remain adequately oxygenated and perfused. </p><p>This topic will discuss management of CPB. Preparations for initiation of CPB are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardiopulmonary-bypass-preparations-and-initiation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cardiopulmonary bypass: Preparations and initiation&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The process of weaning from CPB and common problems encountered in the immediate postbypass period are addressed separately.

Modern CPB machines are also equipped with systems that continuously monitor line or circuit pressure, temperature, and blood parameters (eg, oxygen saturation, blood gases, hemoglobin [Hgb], potassium), as well as safety features such as air and fluid level detection systems and a blood filter in the arterial line. </p><p>During CPB, venous blood is drained from the right atrium (RA; or both superior and inferior vena cavae) and is diverted through the venous line of the CPB circuit into a venous reservoir (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F93255%7ECARD%2F97188\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef93255 graphicRef97188 \">figure 1A-B</a>). CPB machines are typically equipped with vacuum-assisted technology that facilitates drainage to maintain a bloodless surgical field and allow use of smaller venous cannulae and reduced CPB circuit volumes. The arterial pump functions as an artificial heart by withdrawing blood from this reservoir and propelling it through a heat exchanger, an artificial lung (oxygenator or gas exchanger), and finally an arterial line filter. The blood is then returned to the patient via an arterial cannula positioned in the ascending aorta or other major artery. Additional CPB circuit pumps or other components are employed as needed to suction blood from the surgical field, deliver <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cardioplegia-solution-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cardioplegia solution</a> to produce cardiac electromechanical silence, decompress the heart via a vent, and remove fluid (ultrafiltration). Thus, the cardiopulmonary machine temporarily takes over the functions of the heart, lungs, and, to a lesser extent, the kidneys.</p><p>Contact of blood with nonendothelial surfaces of the CPB circuit induces an intense inflammatory response [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiopulmonary-bypass-management/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. This results in platelet activation, initiation of the coagulation cascade, and decreased levels of circulating coagulation factors. Endothelial cells and leukocytes are activated, releasing mediators that may contribute to capillary leakage and tissue edema. Many of the challenges encountered during weaning from CPB and the postbypass period (eg, myocardial dysfunction, vasodilation, bleeding) are thought to be consequences of this inflammatory sequence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiopulmonary-bypass-management/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. Also, the priming solution for the CPB circuit (typically 1 to 2 L of a balanced crystalloid solution) results in hemodilution with temporary or persistent anemia and coagulopathy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H120890927\"><span class=\"h2\">Protocol</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical procedures requiring CPB follow a predictable sequence of events that includes priming and testing of the CPB circuit, anticoagulation, vascular cannulation, initiation and maintenance of CPB, myocardial arrest with myocardial protection, myocardial reperfusion, and finally weaning and termination of CPB. </p><p>Established protocols for management of CPB use parameters approximating normal physiology (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F93596\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93596 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiopulmonary-bypass-management/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In adults, the target flow rate during CPB is 2.2 to 2.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min/m<sup>2</span> </sup>in normothermic patients to approximate a normal cardiac index; cardiac index is appropriately decreased if hypothermia is induced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiopulmonary-bypass-management/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mean arterial pressure (MAP) is generally targeted at &ge;65 mmHg, but the target may be higher in older patients and those with cerebrovascular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiopulmonary-bypass-management/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>].

A continuous arterial blood parameter monitoring system is located in the arterial line of the CPB circuit, and a continuous venous oximeter is located in the venous return line. Arterial blood gas values are checked in the laboratory or by point-of-care testing approximately every 30 minutes, which also allows intermittent recalibration of the continuous blood gas monitor in the arterial line.</p><p>Alpha-stat management of arterial blood gases without temperature correction is employed to maintain a normal range for pCO<sub>2</sub> (35 to 45 mmHg [4.7 to 6 kPa]) and pH (7.35 to 7.45) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiopulmonary-bypass-management/abstract/6,7,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7,10</a>]. Maintaining PaCO<sub>2</sub> and pH within this physiologic range during CPB is important to preserve cerebral autoregulation because hypocarbia decreases cerebral blood flow.

These rates may be slightly decreased if hypothermia is employed. &#160;</p><p>Acute decreases in mean arterial pressure (MAP) or increases in central venous pressure (CVP) may indicate acute reduction in venous return due to the surgeon lifting the heart (causing a reduction in flow), a malpositioned or kinked arterial or venous cannula, or obstruction to blood flow by an air lock. With severe reduction in venous return, the perfusionist may need to administer volume into the CPB reservoir or to reduce arterial flow. Persistent reductions in arterial line flow <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> venous return must be urgently addressed by identifying and correcting the cause.</p><p>Mixed venous oxygen saturation (SvO<sub>2</sub>) is maintained &ge;75 percent throughout CPB as a monitor of adequacy of peripheral perfusion.

Also, lactate values and base deficit are measured when arterial blood gases are obtained approximately every 30 minutes. Although absolute lactate values are dependent on multiple factors, rising levels during CPB represent anaerobic metabolism at the cellular level due to inadequate tissue oxygen delivery, and sustained lactic acidosis is associated with increased morbidity and mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiopulmonary-bypass-management/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. </p><p>Treatment for SvO<sub>2</sub> &lt;75 percent, base deficit &lt;&#8213;5, or lactate level &gt;4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L</span> is directed at increasing the CPB flow rate, as well as assuring that arterial blood gases and hemoglobin (Hgb) levels are adequate. It is common practice to administer <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sodium-bicarbonate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sodium bicarbonate</a> for base deficit &lt;&#8213;5, or lactate level &gt;4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mEq/L,</span> but excessive sodium bicarbonate administration can cause postoperative hypernatremia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiopulmonary-bypass-management/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Although a rising lactate level during CPB is most often the result of inadequate tissue perfusion, persistent lactic acidosis in the postoperative period may occur due to other factors (eg, the beta adrenergic metabolic effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> infusion) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiopulmonary-bypass-management/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2404403984\"><span class=\"h2\">Mean arterial pressure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>MAP is generally targeted at &ge;65 mmHg; a higher target may be selected in older patients and those with cerebrovascular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiopulmonary-bypass-management/abstract/6-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-9</a>]. MAP should not exceed 100 mmHg.

If hypotension persists after increasing pump flow, a vasopressor can be administered as an intravenous (IV) bolus or via continuous infusion. In many institutions, small bolus doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenylephrine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenylephrine</a> (eg, 40 to 100 mcg) are administered directly into the CPB reservoir to treat hypotension.

During implementation of these treatments, clear communication is necessary between the anesthesiologist (who may be adjusting the patient's systemic vascular resistance with vasopressors) and the perfusionist (who may be adjusting the patient's effective cardiac output with pump flow changes).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vasoplegia</strong> &mdash; Severe systemic vasodilation (vasoplegia), characterized by markedly decreased systemic vascular resistance (SVR) and low MAP during and after CPB, occurs in 5 to 25 percent of patients undergoing cardiac surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/cardiopulmonary-bypass-management/abstract/17-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-20</a>].

A significant central to peripheral pressure gradient associated with rewarming at the end of CPB is often present during cardiac surgery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F111035\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef111035 \">figure 2</a>). Connection of a pressure transducer to the side port of the aortic cannula after termination of CPB, or use of a femoral intra-arterial catheter inserted by the surgeon on the field will typically provide an accurate estimate of the true central aortic pressure. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">If hypotension due to vasoplegia (low SVR) is confirmed, it is usually necessary to administer a continuous vasopressor infusion.

Much of the cardioplegia solution will regurgitate back through the incompetent aortic valve into the left ventricle (LV).

Distention causes increased LV wall tension. In combination with inadequate coronary delivery of antegrade cardioplegia solution, this may result in inadequate myocardial protection and severe postbypass LV dysfunction.

In this situation, CPB flow rate can be temporarily reduced to allow the surgeon to manually decompress the LV since successful defibrillation is more likely if the heart is empty (nondistended). Defibrillation is accomplished with internal paddles applied directly to the heart to deliver 10 to 20 joules of electricity.

The normal physiologic functions of the heart and lungs, including circulation of blood, oxygenation, and ventilation, are temporarily taken over by the CPB machine. (See <a href=\"#H187957080\" class=\"local\">'General principles'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Typical parameters during CPB in adults include flow rate controlled at 2.2 to 2.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min/m<sup>2</sup>,</span> maintenance of mean arterial pressure (MAP) &ge;65 mmHg, and mixed venous oxygen saturation &ge;75 percent (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ANEST%2F93596\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef93596 \">table 1</a>). Maintenance of renal blood flow is achieved by maintaining adequate CPB pump flow throughout CPB to minimize the risk of acute kidney injury (AKI). (See <a href=\"#H3043619434\" class=\"local\">'Pump flow and mixed venous oxygen saturation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2404403984\" class=\"local\">'Mean arterial pressure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Arterial pO<sub>2</sub> is maintained at 150 to 250 mmHg during CPB alpha-stat management of arterial blood gases without temperature correction to maintain a normal range for pCO<sub>2</sub> (35 to 45 mmHg [4.7 to 6 kPa]) and pH (7.35 to 7.45).

It is reasonable to monitor processed electroencephalogram (EEG) indices (eg, bispectral index) or the unprocessed EEG to provide data that may detect inadequate anesthesia during CPB. Decreased dosing of the selected neuromuscular blocking agent (NMBA) may be adequate during the hypothermic period of CPB; however, additional NMBA is typically required during rewarming.
