Perioperative outcomes of hepatic resection have improved over time due to the development of surgical techniques that take better advantage of the segmental anatomy of the liver and improved control of bleeding, as well as advances in perioperative care. In addition, more of these procedures are being performed in tertiary centers by specially trained hepatobiliary surgeons who have a higher level of expertise, which is associated with better outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-resection-techniques/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>].</p><p>The techniques for hepatic resection are reviewed here. The indications for hepatic resection, perioperative care (including preoperative assessment of liver function to determine the required volume of remaining liver after resection), complications, and outcomes are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hepatic-resection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hepatic resection&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H93284012\"><span class=\"h1\">SURGICAL ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The liver is located in the right upper quadrant and weighs approximately 2 to 4 pounds (1.2 to 1.6 kg). Access to the liver for hepatic resection is achieved by mobilizing the liver from its various ligamentous attachments, including the coronary ligament, and left and right triangular ligaments (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F67698\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67698 \">figure 1</a>). The porta hepatis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F77043\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77043 \">figure 2</a>) contains the structures that enter the liver, and the gastrohepatic ligament may contain accessory vessels that need to be controlled. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H93284019\"><span class=\"h2\">Segmental anatomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The liver is divided into two lobar segments (right and left) and is further subdivided into eight segments (Couinaud) based upon its vascular supply or bile duct distribution (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F81897\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81897 \">figure 3</a>). Numerous anatomic classifications are available for liver resection. We use the description from the Brisbane 2000 standard (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F66282\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66282 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-resection-techniques/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The eight main segments (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F81897\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81897 \">figure 3</a>) are based on portal vein anatomy including the caudate lobe (segment 1). A ninth segment is sometimes described as a portion of segment 1, but to the right of the inferior vena cava. Although interesting, proximity to the inferior vena cava and the anatomic variability make formal recognition of the ninth segment of little consequence to hepatic resection. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Four sectors are based on hepatic vein anatomy (the caudate lobe is not included).

The common hepatic artery is derived from the celiac axis and carries blood that is well oxygenated, supplying approximately 20 to 25 percent of the blood flow to the liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-resection-techniques/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The remaining 75 to 80 percent of the blood flow to the liver is carried by the portal vein, which is a confluence of the splenic and superior mesenteric veins. Blood transported by the portal vein is less oxygenated but rich in nutrients absorbed from the small intestine. </p><p>The anatomy of the hepatic arterial system is highly variable, with variants identified in 55 to 79 percent of patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-resection-techniques/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. The most common variant is briefly described below. Other variations are shown in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F56984\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56984 \">figure 6</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A replaced right hepatic artery occurs in 11 to 21 percent of patients. It arises from the superior mesenteric artery and runs posterolateral to the common hepatic duct and portal vein (panel C in the figure) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F56984\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56984 \">figure 6</a>). It can be identified by placing a finger through the foramen of Winslow and palpating the posterior aspect of the hepatoduodenal ligament.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A replaced left hepatic artery occurs in 4 to 10 percent of patients. It originates from the left gastric artery and is easily identified as a prominent vessel running in the lesser omentum (gastrohepatic ligament) anterior to the caudate lobe (panel B in the figure) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F56984\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56984 \">figure 6</a>). </p><p/><p>The right and left hepatic artery and portal vein progressively divide to supply the segments of the liver and divide into smaller vessels, and ultimately capillaries, to supply the liver lobules, which are composed of hepatocytes. Blood collects in the hepatic sinusoids and drains into the central vein of the lobule, then into venules, segmental veins, and ultimately, the blood from the liver drains into the vena cava via the hepatic veins (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F50374\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50374 \">figure 5</a>). The prevailing pattern of the hepatic veins in a study of 200 normal livers was a right hepatic vein (RHV) and a common trunk receiving the middle hepatic vein and left hepatic veins in 61 percent of the patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-resection-techniques/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H93285694\"><span class=\"h1\">GENERAL TECHNIQUES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Nearly all elective liver resections for tumor begin with laparoscopy and ultrasound imaging to evaluate the potential for complete resection and to define the relevant anatomy. If resection is feasible, an upper abdominal incision (subcostal, bilateral subcostal [chevron]) is made and the liver is exposed. Cholecystectomy is usually performed followed by dissection of the porta hepatis to isolate and control the vascular and ductal structures. Thereafter, the liver tissue is divided to the extent that is mandated by the type of liver resection being undertaken, and hemostasis achieved prior to abdominal closure. These general procedural steps are discussed in the sections that follow. Specific hepatic resections are discussed in detail below. (See <a href=\"#H93285750\" class=\"local\">'Specific resections'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H93285701\"><span class=\"h2\">Staging laparoscopy and use of ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some patients will not be resectable even if preoperative imaging demonstrates focal disease. Thus, prior to undertaking hepatic resection, laparoscopic exploration should be performed to grossly examine the liver and look for extrahepatic metastatic disease that would preclude hepatic resection (eg, organ surfaces, peritoneum) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-resection-techniques/abstract/11-16\" class=\"abstract_t\">11-16</a>]. If no obvious gross lesions are found, intraoperative ultrasound can be used to examine the liver parenchyma. Ultrasound can identify previously unseen lesions within the liver and is effective in detecting tumor thrombus that may indicate a need to extend the planned resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-resection-techniques/abstract/14,17-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,17-19</a>]. If the future liver remnant is significantly smaller than predicted preoperatively, <span class=\"nowrap\">vascular/biliary</span> anatomy will not permit a safe or margin-negative resection, or a curative resection is unlikely (bilateral diffuse disease), the procedure should be terminated and the laparoscopic wounds closed. In one series of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma, 16 percent of 91 planned resections were aborted because of unresectable disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-resection-techniques/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H93285708\"><span class=\"h2\">Incision and exposure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We use a bilateral subcostal incision (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F89498\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef89498 \">figure 7</a>) because it provides a generous exposure and access to most areas of the liver and major vessels. A superior midline extension from the subcostal incisions can be used for added exposure. When synchronous resection of a nonhepatic primary tumor (eg, colon cancer) and hepatic metastasis will be performed, an extended midline incision can be used. To reach the dome of the liver, for resecting large tumors, or resecting tumors in segment VII or VIII, a right thoracoabdominal incision may be needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-resection-techniques/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Technical aspects of abdominal incisions are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=incisions-for-open-abdominal-surgery#H3294660\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Incisions for open abdominal surgery&quot;, section on 'Subcostal'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=incisions-for-open-abdominal-surgery#H15\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Incisions for open abdominal surgery&quot;, section on 'Midline incision'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=incisions-for-open-abdominal-surgery#H3294667\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Incisions for open abdominal surgery&quot;, section on 'Thoracoabdominal'</a>.)</p><p>Once the incision has been made, abdominal exploration should be repeated. The liver should be inspected, palpated, and re-imaged with ultrasound to confirm there are no contraindications to hepatic resection. Invasion of the porta hepatis or tumor on the posterior aspect of the liver is often a contraindication to standard resection.</p><p>The attachments of the liver to the diaphragm, retroperitoneum, and the gastro-hepatic ligament (coronary ligament, left and right triangular ligaments) are divided, as needed, to adequately expose the liver. We prefer to leave as many of the attachments undisturbed as possible, and if divided, we repair the attachments at the completion of the surgery (as able) to prevent postoperative hepatic torsion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hepatic-resection#H1124056006\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hepatic resection&quot;, section on 'Liver anatomy and physiology'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H38221734\"><span class=\"h3\">Laparoscopic and robotic approach</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A laparoscopic approach is an alternative to open surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-resection-techniques/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. For surgeons who have the appropriate experience with hepatic resection techniques <strong>and</strong> advanced laparoscopic skills, a laparoscopic or robotic approach (for benign or malignant disease) may be a reasonable option for small tumors if an adequate margin can be achieved without excessively prolonging operating time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-resection-techniques/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The use of a hand-assist port is a good option in patients undergoing laparoscopic resection who have a relatively large tumor that will need to be removed from a larger incision. A hand-assist port is also helpful while working with trainees. </p><p>A systematic review of observational studies found significant decreases in blood loss and length of stay with laparoscopic liver resection compared with open surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-resection-techniques/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. For tumor resections, tumor clearance and recurrence rates did not appear to be different compared with open surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-resection-techniques/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>]. However, most studies were small, and adequately powered randomized trials are needed to prove equivalent oncologic outcomes. </p><p>Centers experienced in both hepatic resection and robotic surgery have also begun to perform robot-assisted hepatic resection. The overall utility and effectiveness of this approach, however, remain to be elucidated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-resection-techniques/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H93285722\"><span class=\"h2\">Cholecystectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>All major resections of the liver begin with cholecystectomy, which allows safe dissection and control of the structures of the porta hepatis and eliminates the gallbladder as a source of future problems. The gallbladder is usually removed after evaluation of the porta hepatis but before formal dissection. Once the cystic duct has been transected, a cholangiocatheter can be placed for subsequent cholangiograms, as needed. Technical aspects of open cholecystectomy and intraoperative cholangiography are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=open-cholecystectomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Open cholecystectomy&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H93285729\"><span class=\"h2\">Dissection of the porta hepatis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Dissection of the porta hepatis is needed to a varying extent depending upon the type of hepatic resection chosen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F77043\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef77043 \">figure 2</a>). For major liver resections, it is nearly always performed. The portal vein, proper hepatic artery, and common hepatic duct should be identified and controlled prior to the ligation of any major vessels or hepatic parenchymal dissection. The objective of the dissection of the porta hepatis is proximal and distal control of each of the named structures, including the hepatic ducts, portal veins, and hepatic arteries. The location of the initial dissection in the porta hepatis is based upon the relative anatomy of the hepatic duct <span class=\"nowrap\">confluence/hilar</span> plate, the vascular bifurcations, the confluence of the cystic duct remnant, and the common hepatic duct.</p><p>To perform dissection of the porta hepatis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F89499\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef89499 \">figure 8</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prior to dissection, palpate the hepatoduodenal ligament to identify obvious aberrant (replaced right or left hepatic artery) or accessory structures (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F56984\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef56984 \">figure 6</a>), which, if not appropriately identified and controlled, could lead to excessive bleeding from the transected surface of the liver. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hepatic-resection#H1124056006\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hepatic resection&quot;, section on 'Liver anatomy and physiology'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Begin the dissection at the cranial margin of the stomach and duodenum.

Intraoperative ultrasound can also be helpful in marking the limit of dissection.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H93285736\"><span class=\"h3\">Vascular control</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To minimize blood loss during the course of dividing the liver tissue, particularly during resections that will not involve ligation of vessels of the porta hepatis, the vessels to the liver (hepatic artery, portal vein) can be dissected and individually controlled, or occluded concurrently. Once the resection is completed, intraoperative Duplex ultrasound should confirm normal flow in the remaining vascular structures, particularly if portal clamping was used. </p><p>Concurrent occlusion of the portal vascular structure (ie, Pringle maneuver) places a clamp across the hepatoduodenal ligament (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F51354\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51354 \">figure 9</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-resection-techniques/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The earliest reports using the Pringle maneuver reported high mortality rates, but subsequently, randomized trials have shown significantly reduced blood loss and lower rates of transfusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-resection-techniques/abstract/30-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-38</a>]. The available literature suggests that the Pringle maneuver is uncommonly needed during elective hepatic resection due to improvements in technical skills and devices for dissection and control of bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-resection-techniques/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>] but may be appropriate in emergency circumstances, such as with traumatic hepatic injury. Rather than the Pringle maneuver, we prefer selective control of the vascular structures within the porta hepatis as described above. </p><p>We avoid continuous inflow occlusion (selective or concurrent). Selective inflow occlusion is associated with less hepatic injury compared with continuous occlusion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-resection-techniques/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. During elective hepatic resection, one to two intermittent occlusions of short duration (less than 15 minutes) are usually all that are needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-resection-techniques/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. With selective, intermittent inflow occlusion, transfusion is needed in less than 7 percent of patients at high-volume centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-resection-techniques/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. A rest period of at least 10 minutes between occlusions is also important. During intermittent inflow occlusion, communication with the anesthesiologist regarding the patient's hemodynamic status and potential for reperfusion injury is important (if longer duration occlusion is required).</p><p>Total hepatic isolation is another technique used for vascular control in which the hepatic artery, portal vein, and superior and inferior vena cava are occluded (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F65688\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65688 \">figure 10</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-resection-techniques/abstract/41,42\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42</a>]. However, due to the difficulties in safely managing the retrohepatic vascular structures and associated complications, this technique is generally not used for elective hepatic resection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-resection-techniques/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. We only use this technique if resection or controlled entrance into the inferior vena cava is a planned part of the liver procedure. The technique may be needed to prevent exsanguination when managing high-grade traumatic injuries to the liver. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=surgical-techniques-for-managing-hepatic-injury#H909583385\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Surgical techniques for managing hepatic injury&quot;, section on 'Severe injury'</a>.)</p><p>A low central venous pressure (CVP; eg, 0 to 2 mmHg) may be an adjunctive maneuver to help minimize blood loss [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-resection-techniques/abstract/44-47\" class=\"abstract_t\">44-47</a>]. There are conflicting reports on the roles of low CVP anesthesia, partial hepatic isolation (infrahepatic inferior vena cava occlusion plus the Pringle maneuver), and total hepatic isolation. Among these, for elective hepatic resection, we favor low CVP plus the Pringle maneuver.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H93285743\"><span class=\"h2\">Division of the liver tissue and hemostasis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Liver resection, which is often technically challenging, involves the division of the liver tissue using standard surgical instruments or specialized devices for hemostasis, either anatomically, taking into account segmental anatomy, or nonanatomically (tissue division as needed). We suggest using the clamp-crush technique for liver parenchymal transection because it avoids dependance upon special equipment, is less expensive, and in randomized trials, other methods have not demonstrated any added benefit with respect to decreasing transfusion requirements or perioperative morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-resection-techniques/abstract/48-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">48-51</a>]. Regardless of technique used, a thorough knowledge of the anatomy of the liver is essential. (See <a href=\"#H93284012\" class=\"local\">'Surgical anatomy'</a> above.)</p><p>For nonanatomic hepatic resection, division of the liver tissue and methods for hemostasis are similar to those discussed below for anatomic resection, but the dissection plane does not follow segmental anatomy. </p><p>Prior to parenchymal resection, the planned path of division must be demarcated. For major anatomic resection, the dissection plane will be demarcated as a result of ligation of the inflow structures of the segment or lobe. For less extensive resections, the dissection plane can be identified with the aid of intraoperative ultrasound and marked on the surface of the liver with a monopolar electrocautery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F52023\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef52023 \">figure 11</a>). Vertical mattress sutures can be placed into the liver tissue on either side of the dissection plane to compress the liver parenchyma and minimize bleeding associated with subsequent division of the liver tissue. </p><p>Alternatively, electromechanical tools may help in hepatic parenchymal dissection. Ultrasonic vibration (ie, &quot;harmonic scalpel&quot;) can be used to dissect the liver capsule and first centimeter of superficial parenchyma over the planned surgical plane. Intraoperative ultrasound can easily confirm the resection plane and allows for subsequent division in a bloodless field. Another tool is microwave ablation to perform pre-coagulation along the planned parenchymal resection plane [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-resection-techniques/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. While this is not standard of care, the users of this technology suggest that it decreases blood loss during nonanatomic resection. </p><p>Monopolar electrocautery can be used to divide the liver tissue between the mattress sutures, but the predominant technique is the clamp-crush technique (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F62769\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62769 \">figure 12</a>), in which the liver tissue is gently broken apart using the surgeon's fingers after dividing the liver capsule. Larger vessels (&gt;2 mm) and bile ducts are identified, clamped, and suture ligated, or, alternatively, they can be controlled using other electrosurgical devices. Electrosurgical devices include ultrasonic shears [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-resection-techniques/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>], the Cavitron Ultrasonic Surgical Aspirator (CUSA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-resection-techniques/abstract/54-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">54-56</a>], hydrojet, radiofrequency dissection sealer (RFDS) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-resection-techniques/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>], and bipolar energy transfer systems [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-resection-techniques/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. These devices use various forms of energy to energize the tip of the device to divide and seal structures, including vessels, up to 5 to 6 mm (depending upon the device) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-resection-techniques/abstract/15,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,57</a>]. The basic principles of the various electrosurgical devices are described elsewhere.

For vascular stapler dissection, a combination of clamp-crush and electrocautery prepares the hepatic surface for stapler placement. Once aligned, a series of firings divides and ligates the remaining structures (vessels, ducts) as the liver parenchyma is traversed. Laparoscopic stapling devices can also be used for dividing larger vessels in the liver tissue; however, some larger vessels may need to be ligated by hand (suture ligated, doubly ligated). Articulating staplers provide more precise placement than standard staplers.</p><p>A systematic review evaluated seven trials comparing the clamp-crush technique with different methods of liver dissection and hemostasis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-resection-techniques/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. There were no significant differences in markers of liver parenchymal injury or liver dysfunction, length of intensive care or hospital stay, morbidity, or mortality between the various methods. Transfusion requirements were lower using the clamp-crush technique compared with CUSA and hydrojet. There was no difference in the transfusion requirements of clamp-crush technique and sharp dissection. The clamp-crush technique was quicker than CUSA, hydrojet, and RFDS. The clamp-crush technique was two to six times less expensive than the other methods depending upon the number of surgeries performed each year. Other studies have found that certain devices may decrease operating times, but there were no significant differences in short-term or long-term outcomes compared with the clamp-crush technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hepatic-resection-techniques/abstract/49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">49,50</a>]. </p><p>Once the resection is completed, the hepatic surface should be thoroughly inspected. Discrete vessels on the liver surface can be ligated or clipped.

Multiple segments are referred to as sectors, and their removal is referred to as a sector resection, or sectorectomy.

Malignant tumor within the liver (primary or secondary) is the most common indication for hepatic resection. Benign liver conditions that require hepatic resection are usually symptomatic and can be congenital or acquired. Hepatic trauma is most commonly managed conservatively but on occasion will require hepatic resection to definitively manage hemorrhage. (See <a href=\"#H93283788\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hepatic-resection#H93290227\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hepatic resection&quot;, section on 'Indications for hepatic resection'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients undergoing hepatic resection for malignancy, we suggest performing a staging laparoscopy and intraoperative laparoscopic ultrasound to confirm that resection is possible rather than proceeding directly to open laparotomy. The procedure will need to be terminated without hepatic resection for laparoscopic findings indicating that a curative resection is unlikely, the future liver remnant will be inadequate, or <span class=\"nowrap\">vascular/biliary</span> anatomy will not permit a safe or margin-negative resection. (See <a href=\"#H93285701\" class=\"local\">'Staging laparoscopy and use of ultrasound'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For elective hepatic resection that does not involve ligation of the right or left vascular structures in the porta hepatis, we control the hepatic arteries and portal veins in the porta hepatis individually (vessel loops, clamps) rather than concurrently (ie, Pringle maneuver). The Pringle maneuver may be more appropriate under emergency circumstances, such as with liver trauma. When vascular occlusion is needed, we suggest intermittent occlusion rather than continuous inflow occlusion (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"#H93285736\" class=\"local\">'Vascular control'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatic resection can be performed by dividing the liver tissue nonanatomically or anatomically along planes based upon segmental anatomy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F81897\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81897 \">figure 3</a>). The type of resection depends upon the location of the lesion(s), and for malignant disease, the ability to provide a tumor-negative margin, which may be more likely achieved using an anatomic rather than nonanatomic approach. However, nonanatomic resection may be needed to manage malignancy if the expected residual volume of the liver would be insufficient following an anatomic resection. If high-quality imaging has effectively ruled out malignancy, nonanatomic resection is also acceptable. The types of hepatic resection (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F66282\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66282 \">figure 4</a>) include the following (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hepatic-resection#H29898042\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hepatic resection&quot;, section on 'Type and extent of resection'</a> and <a href=\"#H93285750\" class=\"local\">'Specific resections'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Wedge resection removes a &quot;V&quot;-shaped portion at the margin of the liver.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Segmental resection (segmentectomy, sectorectomy) is the resection of one or more segments of the liver</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hemihepatectomy removes one of the lobes of the liver, right or left.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Extended hemihepatectomy (formerly trisegmentectomy), removes one of the lobes of the liver (right or left) and segment IV.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest using the clamp-crush method for the division of the liver parenchyma, rather than using other electrosurgical devices (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). No significant differences in the various techniques with respect to transfusion rates or other clinically important outcomes have been demonstrated, but the clamp-crush technique, which does not require specialized equipment, is significantly less expensive and, with experience, may be quicker to perform. Surgical staplers are a commonly used alternative to the clamp-crush method for liver parenchymal division.
