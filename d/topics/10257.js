Many signs and symptoms can therefore be induced because the beta receptors affect multiple metabolic and physiologic functions. Other reactions apparently unrelated to beta blockade can occur, but they are uncommon.</p><p>The major side effects associated with the use of beta blockers will be reviewed here. Beta blocker intoxication (overdose) and the clinical use of these drugs for the treatment of arrhythmias, hypertension, myocardial infarction, and heart failure are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=beta-blocker-poisoning\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Beta blocker poisoning&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=choice-of-drug-therapy-in-primary-essential-hypertension#H22\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Choice of drug therapy in primary (essential) hypertension&quot;, section on 'Beta blockers'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-myocardial-infarction-role-of-beta-blocker-therapy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute myocardial infarction: Role of beta blocker therapy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-beta-blockers-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of beta blockers in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">ADVERSE CARDIAC EFFECTS DUE TO BETA BLOCKADE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Major cardiac effects caused by beta blockade include the precipitation or worsening of congestive heart failure, and significant negative chronotropy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Heart failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Beta blockers are an important component of long-term therapy for patients with chronic heart failure and reduced left ventricular systolic function, as these drugs reduce the detrimental effects of excess chronic catecholamine stimulation. However, beta blockers may exacerbate symptoms in patients with acute decompensated heart failure or in those with preexisting myocardial dysfunction and borderline compensation, since the maintenance of cardiac output in such patients depends in part upon sympathetic drive. Hence, beta blockers should not be administered as new therapy until after heart failure is compensated. However, patients already receiving beta blockers can be continued on this therapy if there is decompensated heart failure. </p><p>Increased peripheral vascular resistance, induced by nonselective beta blockers, also may contribute to the decline in myocardial function in this setting. On the other hand, drugs with intrinsic sympathetic activity (ISA), such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pindolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pindolol</a>, may be less likely to impair myocardial function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-beta-blockers/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>Despite these concerns, only a minority of patients with stable heart failure deteriorate after the initiation of beta blocker therapy. As an example, worsening of heart failure was observed in only 6 percent of patients with chronic heart failure who were being treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carvedilol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carvedilol</a>&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-beta-blockers/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Furthermore, long-term therapy with beta blockers is often beneficial in such patients, improving survival in patients with systolic heart failure and improving diastolic function in patients with diastolic heart failure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=use-of-beta-blockers-in-heart-failure-with-reduced-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Use of beta blockers in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prognosis-of-heart-failure-with-preserved-ejection-fraction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prognosis of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Another concern about beta blockers in patients with HF is the occurrence of other symptoms, including dizziness due to hypotension and bradycardia. One study that reviewed data from HF trials reported between 1966 and 2002 found that, although beta blockers were associated with these side effects, the absolute increase in symptoms was small and did not necessitate withdrawal of drug therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-beta-blockers/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Negative chronotropic effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Slowing of the resting heart rate and the development of sinus bradycardia is a normal response to treatment with a beta blocker. This effect is less prominent with drugs with ISA. Nevertheless, all beta blockers are relatively contraindicated in patients with symptomatic bradycardia that may be associated with a sick sinus syndrome, especially if there is a further reduction in rate, unless an artificial pacemaker is present.</p><p>Beta blockers also depress conduction through the atrioventricular node, potentially causing heart block. Use of a beta blocking drug can therefore lead to a serious bradyarrhythmia in patients with an underlying complete or partial AV conduction defect (ie, second or third degree AV block), especially if the patient is also receiving another agent that impairs AV nodal conduction such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> or a calcium channel blocker. Compounds with ISA may cause less impairment of atrioventricular conduction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-beta-blockers/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Beta blocker withdrawal</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute withdrawal of a beta blocker can lead to substantial morbidity and even mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-beta-blockers/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The most important concern with beta blocker withdrawal is the exacerbation of ischemic symptoms, including the precipitation of an acute myocardial infarction, in patients with known coronary artery disease. In some cases there may be the precipitation of serious ventricular tachyarrhythmia, including sudden cardiac death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-beta-blockers/abstract/6-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-8</a>]. This can occur even in patients who have no previous history of coronary symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-beta-blockers/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>These withdrawal symptoms are due to increased sympathetic activity, which is a probable reflection of adrenergic receptor upregulation during the period of sympathetic blockade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-beta-blockers/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Upregulation of beta receptors results in an increase in beta receptor responsiveness to circulating catecholamines. The degree to which this will occur depends upon the relationship between the rate at which beta blockade wears off and the rate at which the receptors downregulate (the latter has a half-life of 24 to 36 hours) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-beta-blockers/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Thus, a hyperadrenergic state is most likely with short-acting drugs (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a>), since receptor upregulation will persist after the antihypertensive effect has disappeared [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-beta-blockers/abstract/5,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,10</a>]. Gradual tapering of the propranolol dose will diminish the risk of withdrawal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-beta-blockers/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. In comparison, withdrawal syndromes are relatively unusual with longer-acting agents (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atenolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atenolol</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nadolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nadolol</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-beta-blockers/abstract/5,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,10</a>].</p><p>Although data about the timing of beta blocker withdrawal are not available, we use the following approach in patients who must stop taking a beta blocker:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For beta blockers with shorter half-lives which require twice daily administration (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a>, short acting <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoprolol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carvedilol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carvedilol</a>), we have patients take their usual dose once daily for one week, then every other day for one week, then stop the medication.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For beta blockers with longer half-lives that are administered once daily (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atenolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atenolol</a>, long acting <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoprolol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nadolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nadolol</a>), we have patient take one-half their usual dose once daily for one week, then one-half their usual dose every other day for a week, then stop the medication. However, beta blocker withdrawal can be accomplished in less time if necessary, usually by taking one-half the usual dose every other day for a week. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">ADVERSE NONCARDIAC EFFECTS DUE TO BETA BLOCKADE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The lungs, peripheral blood vessels, glucose metabolism, and central nervous system are all affected by beta blockade although the clinical magnitude of the last three effects seems less pronounced than originally thought.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Increased airways resistance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Beta blockade with nonselective agents prevents bronchodilation due to bronchial beta-2 receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-beta-blockers/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. This can lead to increased airways resistance in patients with bronchospastic disease, a problem that is less likely to occur with compounds with ISA or beta-1 selectivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-beta-blockers/abstract/12-14\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-14</a>]. Beta-1 selectivity is not absolute, however, and may diminish at higher doses. It has also been suggested that combined beta and alpha blockade with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=labetalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">labetalol</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carvedilol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carvedilol</a> may be better tolerated than nonselective agents in patients with chronic lung disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-beta-blockers/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p>All beta blockers should be avoided in patients with severe or decompensated bronchospastic disease; nonselective beta blockers should generally be avoided in susceptible patients with mild to moderate bronchospastic disease, while the selective beta blockers or possibly combined alpha and beta blockers appear to be safe and should be used with caution. Therapeutic doses of beta-1 selective beta blockers are generally well tolerated, although some patients who are using inhaled beta agonists may require an increase inhaler requirement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-beta-blockers/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. This issue of beta blocker therapy in patients with chronic obstructive disease is discussed more fully elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-the-patient-with-copd-and-cardiovascular-disease#H81297784\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of the patient with COPD and cardiovascular disease&quot;, section on 'Treatment of CVD in patients with COPD'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Exacerbation of peripheral artery disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Initial studies with nonselective beta blockers (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a>) in patients with severe peripheral artery disease described a variety of complications including worsening claudication, cold extremities, absent pulses, and, in some cases, cyanosis and impending gangrene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-beta-blockers/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Raynaud's phenomenon can also be a manifestation of nonselective beta blockade [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-beta-blockers/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. It was thought that both the reduction in cardiac output and blockade of beta-2-receptor-mediated vasodilation of vessels within skeletal muscle contribute to the vascular insufficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-beta-blockers/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. Beta blockers with beta-1 selectivity or ISA do not affect the peripheral vessels to the same degree as the nonselective drugs.</p><p>A meta-analysis of published studies in patients with mild to moderate peripheral artery disease found no exacerbation of symptoms with beta blockers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-beta-blockers/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Thus, the concern may be overstated, particularly in patients with mild to moderate disease treated with a beta-1 selective agent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-beta-blockers/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. Although selective agents can also be used in patients with severe disease, they should be used cautiously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-beta-blockers/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-claudication\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of claudication&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Facilitation of hypoglycemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Epinephrine, acting via the beta-adrenergic receptors, has important effects on glucose metabolism. It increases glucose production by stimulating both glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis from amino acids, glycerol, and pyruvate. It also increases the delivery of these gluconeogenic substrates from the peripheral tissue, inhibits glucose utilization by several tissues, and, via the alpha-2-receptors, inhibits insulin secretion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=physiologic-response-to-hypoglycemia-in-normal-subjects-and-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Physiologic response to hypoglycemia in normal subjects and patients with diabetes mellitus&quot;</a>.)</p><p>All of these actions help to protect against the development of hypoglycemia. In addition, epinephrine induces early warning symptoms of neuroglycopenia, such as sweating and anxiety.</p><p>Studies published in the 1960s showed that nonselective beta blockers can retard recovery from insulin-induced hypoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-beta-blockers/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>] and that the reactions are more likely to be severe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-beta-blockers/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. The latter effect is presumably due to diminished or absent early warning signs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-beta-blockers/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. However, later studies showed that the effects on glucose metabolism may be less prominent with beta-1 selective drugs and those with ISA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-beta-blockers/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>] and that an increased risk of serious hypoglycemia among patients with diabetes mellitus was hard to demonstrate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-beta-blockers/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. Furthermore, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carvedilol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carvedilol</a> appears to promote glucose utilization and lower insulin levels in patients with type 2 diabetes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-beta-blockers/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-hypertension-in-patients-with-diabetes-mellitus#H24\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of hypertension in patients with diabetes mellitus&quot;, section on 'Beta blockers'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Hyperkalemia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Catecholamines have potentially important clinical effects on potassium balance, primarily by influencing the distribution of potassium between the extracellular fluid and the cells. In particular, stimulation of the beta-2-receptors by epinephrine promotes the movement of extracellular potassium into the cells, thereby lowering the plasma potassium concentration. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hypokalemia-in-adults#H17666854\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hypokalemia in adults&quot;, section on 'Elevated beta-adrenergic activity'</a>.)</p><p>These effects on potassium balance can be reversed by beta-adrenergic blockers, which will tend to impair potassium entry into the cells, thereby raising the plasma potassium concentration after a potassium load. This is most likely to occur with the nonselective beta blockers (such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=labetalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">labetalol</a>); in contrast, the beta-1 selective agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atenolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atenolol</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoprolol</a> have little effect, since the beta-2 receptors remain intact [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-beta-blockers/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>].</p><p>In most cases, the administration of beta blockers is associated with only a minor elevation in the plasma potassium concentration of less than 0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">meq/L,</span> as the potassium that cannot enter the cells is excreted in the urine. True hyperkalemia is rare unless associated with a superimposed problem such as a marked potassium load, marked exercise (which is associated with the release of potassium from the cells into the extracellular fluid), hypoaldosteronism, heart failure exacerbation, or end-stage renal disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-beta-blockers/abstract/34-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-36</a>].

However, these associations are primarily based upon case series and randomized trials with methodologic flaws.</p><p>The best available data on this issue come from a systematic review of randomized trials, which found no increased risk of depression with beta blocker therapy, and only small increases in fatigue and sexual dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-beta-blockers/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. The review included 15 randomized, placebo-controlled trials involving more than 35,000 patients who were followed for a minimum of six months. Both patient reported symptoms and withdrawal of therapy were investigated. The following findings were reported:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>There was a small significant increase in risk of fatigue (18 per 1000 patients, 95% CI 5-30).

However, the number of trials was small and the confidence intervals were wide.</p><p/><p>One small study of 96 patients treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atenolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atenolol</a> suggested that erectile dysfunction was possibly related to knowledge about this as a side effect and the anxiety provoked rather than as a direct consequence of the drug [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-beta-blockers/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. In addition, among those who developed erectile dysfunction, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sildenafil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sildenafil</a> and placebo were equally effective as therapy.</p><p>Thus, although beta blockers appear to cause small increases in the risk of fatigue and sexual dysfunction, the risk is much lower than previously thought, and beta blockers should not be withheld based upon concerns about developing these adverse effects.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H23772956\"><span class=\"h2\">Lipid metabolism</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Beta blockers interfere with lipid metabolism and are associated with alteration of serum triglyceride and HDL-cholesterol concentrations.

Bronchospasm and respiratory depression may also occur due perhaps to severe circulatory impairment or a central drug effect. The myocardium in severe intoxications may become relatively refractory to pharmacologic and electrical stimulation, resulting in asystolic death. Changes in mental status, convulsions, and coma have also been described.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sotalol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Sotalol</a> intoxication differs from that seen with other beta blockers. In addition to hypotension and bradycardia, patients have significantly prolonged corrected QT intervals and severe ventricular tachyarrhythmias. Intoxicated patients should be managed with intensive supportive care in facilities equipped for continuous cardiac monitoring and ventilatory support. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=beta-blocker-poisoning\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Beta blocker poisoning&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients.

Beta blockers may also precipitate HF in those with preexisting myocardial dysfunction and borderline compensation since the maintenance of cardiac output in such patients depends in part upon sympathetic drive. Increased peripheral vascular resistance, induced by nonselective beta blockers, also may contribute to the decline in myocardial function in this setting. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Heart failure'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beta blockers are relatively contraindicated in patients with symptomatic bradycardia that may be associated with a sick sinus syndrome, especially if there is a further reduction in rate. Beta blockers also depress conduction through the atrioventricular node, potentially leading to a serious bradyarrhythmia in patients with an underlying complete or partial AV conduction defect (ie, second or third degree AV block). This is especially true if the patient is also receiving another agent that impairs AV nodal conduction such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=digoxin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">digoxin</a> or a calcium channel blocker. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Negative chronotropic effects'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute withdrawal of a beta blocker can lead to increased sympathetic activity (most likely with short-acting drugs). This hyperadrenergic state may lead to accelerated angina, myocardial infarction, or even sudden death. Although no data are available, we use the following approach in patients who must stop taking a beta blocker (see <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Beta blocker withdrawal'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For beta blockers with shorter half-lives which require twice daily administration (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propranolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propranolol</a>, short acting <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoprolol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carvedilol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carvedilol</a>), we have patients take their usual dose once daily for one week, then every other day for one week, then stop the medication.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>For beta blockers with longer half-lives that are administered once daily (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atenolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">atenolol</a>, long acting <a href=\"topic.htm?path=metoprolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">metoprolol</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nadolol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">nadolol</a>), we have patient take one-half their usual dose once daily for one week, then one-half their usual dose every other day for a week, then stop the medication. However, beta blocker withdrawal can be accomplished in less time if necessary, usually by taking one-half the usual dose every other day for a week. </p><p/><p>While beta blockers have many noncardiac effects, their effects on the lungs, energy levels, and sexual function are the most common and significant.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Beta blockade with nonselective agents prevents bronchodilation due to bronchial beta-2 receptors, leading to increased airway resistance in patients with bronchospastic disease. While therapeutic doses of beta-1 selective beta blockers are generally well tolerated and can be safely used in most patients, the risks and benefits should be considered prior to initiating treatment in patients with severe or decompensated bronchospastic airway disease. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Increased airways resistance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Depression, fatigue, and sexual dysfunction are commonly cited side effects of beta blockers. However, a systematic review of randomized trials found no increased risk of depression with beta blocker therapy, and only small increases in fatigue and sexual dysfunction. As such, while the occasional patient may need to discontinue a beta blocker because of one of these side effects, beta blockers should not be initially withheld based upon concerns about developing these adverse effects. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Depression, fatigue, sexual dysfunction'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/major-side-effects-of-beta-blockers/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Taylor SH, Silke B, Lee PS.
