It can occur in either of two configurations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The curvature of the fetal spine is oriented upward (also called &quot;back-up&quot; or dorsosuperior), and the fetal small parts and umbilical cord present at the cervix.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The curvature of the fetal spine is oriented downward (also called &quot;back-down&quot; or dorsoinferior), and the fetal shoulder presents at the cervix (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F51908\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef51908 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p>(Note: Lie refers to the long axis of the fetus relative to the longitudinal axis of the uterus; it can be longitudinal, transverse, or oblique. Presentation refers to the fetal part that directly overlies the pelvic inlet; it is usually vertex [head] or breech [buttocks], but can be a shoulder, compound [eg, head and hand], or funic [umbilical cord]. Position is the relationship of a nominated site of the presenting part to a denominating location on the maternal pelvis, eg, right occiput anterior.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately one in 300 fetuses is in a transverse lie at delivery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-fetal-lie/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. It is most common early in gestation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-fetal-lie/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">NATURAL HISTORY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transverse lie is unstable: Most fetuses in transverse lie early in pregnancy convert to a cephalic (or breech) presentation. In one report, transverse lie was detected in 146 fetuses at 24 to 28 weeks and 15 percent persisted to term [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-fetal-lie/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In another report of 29 fetuses in transverse lie at 37 weeks of gestation, 24 fetuses (83 percent) spontaneously converted to a longitudinal lie with either vertex <span class=\"nowrap\">(15/24)</span> or breech <span class=\"nowrap\">(9/24)</span> presentations in labor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-fetal-lie/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Transverse lie persisted in the five (17 percent) remaining patients. Overall, the cesarean delivery rate was 13 of 29 (45 percent); indications were breech presentation in eight cases and transverse lie in five cases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of theories have been proposed to explain fetal presentation and the eventual cephalic presentation of most fetuses as pregnancy reaches term. Gravity and fetal comfort may play important roles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-fetal-lie/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Early in pregnancy when the volume of amniotic fluid is relatively large in relation to the volume of the fetus, the fetus is less constrained by the size of the uterus and is often found in a noncephalic presentation. As pregnancy continues and the volume of amniotic fluid diminishes relative to fetal size, the fetus is usually found in a longitudinal lie with the greatest mass of the fetus (the buttocks and flexed thighs) in the fundus. The longitudinal lie presents a body axis posture along the line of gravity and with the least constriction to overall fetal movement.</p><p>Prematurity is the most common risk factor for transverse lie. Other risk factors include high parity, placenta previa, contracted pelvis, uterine anomalies or tumors, polyhydramnios, fetal anomaly, and multiple pregnancy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-fetal-lie/abstract/1,7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7,8</a>]. The site of the placental implantation site, distortion of the uterus by anatomical factors, and uterine distension modify the configuration of space within the uterine cavity and likely affect fetal position by this mechanism.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In developing countries where placental imaging, urgent cesarean delivery, and neonatal intensive care are not readily available, the maternal and perinatal <span class=\"nowrap\">mortality/morbidity</span> associated with transverse lie in labor can be high. As an example, a report from the Korle Bu Hospital in Accra, Ghana described 152 patients in labor with transverse lie from 1996 to 1998: Pregnancy outcome included two maternal deaths due to sepsis and hemorrhage, 25 stillbirths, and 37 infants requiring hospital care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-fetal-lie/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. <span class=\"nowrap\">Fetal/newborn</span> complications included asphyxia, prematurity, and septicemia.</p><p>Even though modern perinatal care has reduced much of the morbidity and mortality associated with this condition, these pregnancies are, nevertheless, at increased risk of maternal and perinatal morbidity as compared with pregnancies in which the fetus is a cephalic or breech presentation. In developed countries, placenta previa, prolapse of the umbilical cord, fetal trauma, fetal anomalies, and prematurity contribute to morbidity from transverse lie [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-fetal-lie/abstract/5,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,10</a>]. In developing regions, uterine rupture from prolonged labor in a transverse lie is also a major reason for <span class=\"nowrap\">maternal/perinatal</span> mortality and morbidity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-fetal-lie/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=umbilical-cord-prolapse\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Umbilical cord prolapse&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL MANIFESTATIONS AND DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Not infrequently, the gravida suspects transverse lie because of an abnormal configuration of her abdomen or discomfort associated with the position of the fetal head in her flank.</p><p>The diagnosis can be made by abdominal palpation utilizing Leopold's maneuvers (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F60727\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60727 \">figure 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-fetal-lie/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Transverse lie should be suspected when the firm resistance typical of the fetal head is not appreciated upon palpation of the uterus above the symphysis pubis. Additional palpation will detect the fetal head in one of the mother's flanks, confirming the diagnosis. The location of the fetal back up or down is more difficult to determine, especially if the patient is obese.</p><p>The sensitivity of abdominal palpation for detecting non-cephalic presentations (breech, oblique, or transverse lie) at 35 to 37 weeks of gestation is about 70 percent. Although abdominal palpation is more likely to correctly identify a transverse lie than a breech presentation, the sensitivity of abdominal examination for detecting transverse lie is not known because the prevalence of this abnormal presentation is too low to conduct a robust study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-fetal-lie/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>Ultrasound examination is used to confirm the diagnosis and determine the precise lie, presentation, and position of the fetus. In addition, a survey of maternal pelvic and fetal anatomy should be performed when transverse lie is identified to look for abnormalities or conditions associated with this unstable position, such as placenta previa (see <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis and risk factors'</a> above). If transverse lie is suspected by abdominal palpation and placenta previa has not been excluded by ultrasound examination, a vaginal examination should not be performed until the absence of previa is ascertained.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">MANAGEMENT OF DELIVERY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most fetuses in transverse lie are delivered by cesarean. The route of delivery depends upon the clinical circumstances at the time the diagnosis is made. Important factors to consider include the positions of the placenta and umbilical cord, fetal age and viability, whether labor has begun or membranes have ruptured, and whether the transverse lie is a second twin.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Transverse lie, intact membranes, live fetus</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H443188271\"><span class=\"h3\">Before onset of labor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When the diagnosis of singleton fetus in transverse lie is made before the onset of labor and in the absence of contraindications to a vaginal delivery, we perform external version to cephalic presentation at approximately 37 weeks of gestation, as amniotic fluid volume is maximal, and uterine tone and fetal weight are lower than later in gestation, which likely improves success rates. If successful and the nonlongitudinal lie (ie, transverse, oblique) recurs, we reattempt external cephalic version (ECV) at 38 to 39 weeks of gestation. If again successful, we rupture membranes while the vertex is held in position and induce labor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-fetal-lie/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. If ECV is declined or the first or repeat ECV is unsuccessful, then cesarean delivery is performed at 39+0 to 39+6 weeks. An alternative approach is to perform the initial ECV at 39+0 weeks, immediately followed by rupture of membranes and labor induction of the now cephalic presentation. This approach is likely associated with a higher risk of unsuccessful ECV, but also reduces the risk of reversion to a nonlongitudinal lie and need for a repeat procedure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=external-cephalic-version#H620039933\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;External cephalic version&quot;, section on 'Nonlongitudinal lies'</a>.)</p><p>If the vertex is high in the pelvis when membranes are to be ruptured, the procedure should be performed in a delivery room by puncturing the membranes with a long 20 gauge needle (eg, needle used for spinal or pudendal anesthesia) rather than an amniohook to control the flow of amniotic fluid and reduce the risk of cord prolapse. The rationale for induction of labor rather than expectant management is that transverse lie is an unstable presentation that may have resulted from physical factors (eg, contracted pelvis, uterine anomalies or tumors, polyhydramnios, fetal anomaly) that persist after successful external cephalic version, so the fetus is at increased risk for spontaneous reversion. This is in contrast to successful external version in breech presentation, where reversion to breech presentation is uncommon. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=external-cephalic-version\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;External cephalic version&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Only one study has compared active management (external version plus elective induction of labor at term) with expectant management of transverse lie [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-fetal-lie/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. Among the 102 patients managed actively, there was one prolapsed umbilical cord and no perinatal deaths, while among the 50 patients managed expectantly, there were 10 cord prolapses, four arm prolapses, and one perinatal death related to delivery of a fetus with arm prolapse. Three other perinatal deaths in the expectant management group were associated with major congenital malformations. The incidence of cesarean delivery was lower among women managed actively (11 versus 40 percent). Based on these limited data, it appears that active intervention at &ge;38 weeks of gestation may result in fewer perinatal deaths and cord prolapse from spontaneous rupture of membranes than expectant management, and also offers the mother, who is often a multiparous patient, a higher likelihood of vaginal delivery. In a population-based study, the risk that an infant born at 38 weeks of gestation by scheduled cesarean delivery will develop respiratory morbidity of any severity was 3.5 percent, and the risk of neonatal death was less than 1 in 1500 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-fetal-lie/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. These risks are lower than the risk of prolapse of the umbilical cord or arm after 37 weeks, which may be as high as 28 percent in patients who are managed expectantly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-fetal-lie/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H443188390\"><span class=\"h3\">Early labor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients in early labor with a singleton fetus in transverse lie, intact membranes, and a live fetus, we suggest external version to cephalic presentation followed by artificial rupture of the membranes while the vertex is held in position, as described above. In the only study of this approach, 12 women in labor with a transverse lie were given tocolysis and then underwent external version [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-fetal-lie/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Successful version to a longitudinal presentation (nine cephalic, one breech) was achieved in 10 patients (83 percent) and six patients (50 percent) were delivered vaginally. Conversely, if external cephalic version is unsuccessful, we perform a cesarean delivery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H443188596\"><span class=\"h3\">Active labor</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For patients who present in active labor with a singleton fetus in transverse lie, we perform a cesarean delivery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Transverse lie with ruptured membranes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If membranes have ruptured and gestational age is &ge;34 weeks, we perform a cesarean delivery. If gestational age is &lt;34 weeks, expectant management is a reasonable option as long as the ability to perform cesarean delivery promptly is available, given the increased risk of cord prolapse.</p><p>In some circumstances between 28 and 34 weeks, delivery rather than expectant management may result in a better neonatal outcome. In such settings, we suggest administering a course of antenatal corticosteroids and monitoring the mother and fetus continuously for 48 hours, with intervention if clinically indicated (eg, signs of infection, abnormal fetal heart rate tracing). After completion of the course of corticosteroids, further management is decided on a case-by-case basis. We may deliver pregnancies with a funic cord presentation and a dilated cervix, particularly if we believe the patient might be in the latent phase of labor. Lack of local neonatal intensive care unit resources and 24-hour anesthesia availability if emergency delivery is required are other examples of situations where delivery may be preferable to expectant management.</p><p>We avoid external cephalic version in patients with ruptured membranes, in agreement with most clinical guidelines [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-fetal-lie/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Version is less likely to be successful and the risk of maternal and fetal complications is probably increased [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-fetal-lie/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Transverse lie of second twin after delivery of first twin</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>After delivery of the first twin, the second twin may assume a transverse lie, regardless of its original position in the uterus. We perform internal podalic version to breech presentation and breech extraction of the transverse second twin (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F58961%7EOBGYN%2F71779\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58961 graphicRef71779 \">figure 3A-B</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-fetal-lie/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. This procedure is accomplished promptly after delivery of the first twin while the cervix is fully dilated and the membranes of the undelivered twin are still intact [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-fetal-lie/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Such a delivery should be attempted only by an obstetrician who has experience with this maneuver because of the risks of fetal trauma.</p><p>An alternative maneuver is external cephalic version using ultrasound to monitor the procedure and the ultrasound transducer to assist with the version, as illustrated in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F69164\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef69164 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-fetal-lie/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>There are no prospective trials that provide strong evidence of the relative merits of internal versus external version or cesarean delivery for managing the delivery of the second twin in transverse lie. Based on level of training and experience, the provider should recommend the approach <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> is most comfortable with. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=twin-pregnancy-labor-and-delivery#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Twin pregnancy: Labor and delivery&quot;, section on 'Second twin'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H467014597\"><span class=\"h2\">Transverse lie with fetal demise or previable fetus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In cases of fetal demise or previable fetus in transverse lie before labor or in early labor, we suggest external version to achieve a longitudinal lie (cephalic or breech) followed by induction of labor or augmentation, if appropriate. If the fetus is in transverse lie during active labor, internal podalic version by an experienced practitioner is an option in the second stage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-fetal-lie/abstract/20-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">20-22</a>].</p><p>If the fetus is extremely small (&lt;600 to 800 grams) and dead, the body may collapse and double up on itself (conduplicato corpore) during labor, thus allowing the head and thorax to simultaneously pass through the pelvis and deliver vaginally.

The surgeon standing on the same side as the fetal head then attempts to grasp the fetal feet and perform a footling breech extraction. If difficulty is encountered, a vertical incision is made to form an inverted-T.</p><p>In one series of 66 patients who underwent cesarean delivery for transverse lie, 92 percent were successfully delivered through the low isthmic transverse uterine incision; conversion of this incision to an inverted-T was necessary in 5 cases (8 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-fetal-lie/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Of note, 39 of the 66 fetuses (59 percent) were dorsosuperior and 27 (41 percent) were dorsoinferior; 20 were preterm with an overall mean gestational age of 33.9&plusmn;2.5 weeks. The inverted&ndash;T was performed in four dorsosuperior presentations (one with ruptured membranes) and one dorsoinferior presentation with ruptured membranes.</p><p>A second report included 80 term patients in which cesarean delivery for singleton fetuses in transverse lie was accomplished in 79 (99 percent) using a transverse curvilinear incision in the lower uterine segment, with no extensions of the uterine wound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-fetal-lie/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Neonatal morbidity consisted of a fractured femur in one infant and torticollis in another, and no serious maternal morbidity occurred related to the method of delivery. The number of dorsosuperior and dorsoinferior fetuses was not provided.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H443188467\"><span class=\"h2\">Dorsoinferior (back down) transverse lie</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The dorsoinferior (back down) transverse lie is more difficult to deliver than the back up transverse lie because the fetal feet are difficult to grasp. If the fetal membranes are intact, we perform an intra-abdominal version to convert the transverse lie to a cephalic or breech presentation before making the hysterotomy, thus facilitating delivery through the low segment accentuated curvilinear transverse uterine incision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-fetal-lie/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>].</p><p>For the version, one hand is placed on the fetal head and the other hand is placed on the buttocks. The fetal pole that will become the presenting part is very gently manipulated toward the pelvic inlet while the other pole is guided in the opposite direction. Although either cephalic or podalic version can be performed, we have found that breech extraction is technically easier. After the version has been completed, an assistant holds the fetus in the longitudinal position so it will not revert to its original position (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F58320%7EOBGYN%2F76598\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58320 graphicRef76598 \">figure 5A-B</a>), the hysterotomy is made, and the fetus is delivered.</p><p>Some experts recommend a vertical uterine incision for the back down transverse lie [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-fetal-lie/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>], which is also a reasonable approach. We believe a vertical hysterotomy, even if mostly confined to the lower segment, is less desirable than a transverse incision as it may increase the risk of uterine rupture in a subsequent pregnancy, but it may be necessary if the lower uterine segment is poorly developed. As described in the series above, all 26 dorsoinferior fetuses with intact membranes were successfully delivered through a low transverse incision [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-fetal-lie/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. If the fetus is large, especially if membranes are ruptured and the shoulder is impacted in the birth canal, a classical incision may be necessary [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/transverse-fetal-lie/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2015801083\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.
