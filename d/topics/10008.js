The study was a landmark in the evolution of liver transplantation. First, the introduction stated that rejection remained an important cause of graft loss and death. Second, the paper reported that survival with cyclosporine and tacrolimus was similar but that tacrolimus was associated with fewer episodes of steroid-resistant rejection. Third, it reported that tacrolimus was associated with excess adverse events, including nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity.</p><p>Liver transplantation has evolved substantially since that publication, and we have addressed many of the issues outlined in the 1994 study. Acute rejection is usually easy to manage, and we now try to balance the risk of rejection with the risk of drug toxicity. Our focus has shifted to avoiding the long-term complications of immunosuppression and recurrent liver disease. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Tacrolimus</a> has become first-line immunosuppression in most liver transplant programs, and a number of supplemental drugs allow us to customize immunosuppression.</p><p>This topic will provide an overview of the drugs used for immunosuppression following liver transplantation. The diagnosis and treatment of acute cellular rejection are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=liver-transplantation-diagnosis-of-acute-cellular-rejection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Liver transplantation: Diagnosis of acute cellular rejection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-acute-cellular-rejection-of-the-liver-allograft\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of acute cellular rejection of the liver allograft&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">IMMUNOBIOLOGY OF ACUTE REJECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Organ rejection is a multistep process that includes alloantigen recognition, lymphocyte activation, clonal expansion, and graft inflammation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F54486\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef54486 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F60525\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60525 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Signal I: Alloantigen recognition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Alloantigen recognition requires presentation of a foreign alloantigen along with a host major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule. Presentation is done by an antigen-presenting cell (APC). The antigen, bound to an MHC molecule, binds to the T-cell receptor. This is the first of three signals that are required for T-cell maturation and can be aborted by antilymphocyte antibodies. (See <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Antibody therapy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Signal II: Lymphocyte activation (costimulation)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>T-cell activation requires costimulation, a process in which a number of ligands on the APC bind to a variety of T-cell receptors, including CD28, CD154, CD2, CD11a, and CD54. The T-cell receptor complex is internalized and binds to immunophilin. Immunophilin stimulates calcineurin, which activates nuclear factor of T-cell activation (NFAT) by removing pyrophosphate. The activated NFAT then translocates to the nucleus where it drives interleukin (IL)-2 transcription. Two immunophilin targets, cyclophilin and FK-binding protein, are targets of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>, respectively. Both agents block calcineurin and are known collectively as calcineurin inhibitors. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Tacrolimus'</a> below and <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Cyclosporine'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Signal III: Clonal expansion</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Newly synthesized IL-2 is secreted by T cells and binds to IL-2 receptors (IL-2R) on the cell surface in an autocrine fashion, stimulating a burst of cell proliferation. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basiliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Basiliximab</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=daclizumab-withdrawn-from-market-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">daclizumab</a>, both monoclonal antibodies against the IL-2 receptor, block this signal. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Sirolimus</a>, which binds to the downstream mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), also acts at this step. Finally, the proliferation burst can be inhibited at the level of DNA synthesis by <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil. (See <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'Basiliximab and daclizumab'</a> below and <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Sirolimus'</a> below and <a href=\"#H22\" class=\"local\">'Inhibitors of purine and pyrimidine synthesis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Inflammation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>T-cell proliferation is associated with cell-mediated cytotoxicity and secretion of cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules. The secreted mediators recruit additional inflammatory cells to the graft. The result is an inflammatory milieu with additional toxic and vasoactive mediators. Control of this step is possible with glucocorticoids and antilymphocyte antibodies. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoids'</a> below and <a href=\"#H25\" class=\"local\">'Antibody therapy'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1560423\"><span class=\"h1\">DRUG INTERACTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A major issue with the immunosuppressive agents used for liver transplant recipients (particularly calcineurin inhibitors and mechanistic target of rapamycin inhibitors) is their extensive metabolism by CYP3A4. This creates the potential for drug-drug interactions that may produce toxicity or dangerously low levels of immunosuppressive agents, leading to an increased risk of rejection. As examples, antifungal agents, some antibiotics, and many of the drugs used in the treatment of HIV inhibit CYP3A4. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=kidney-transplantation-in-hiv-infected-individuals\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Kidney transplantation in HIV-infected individuals&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A knowledge of the common interfering compounds is essential and drug levels must be monitored closely when these compounds are used (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F110436\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110436 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">GLUCOCORTICOIDS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glucocorticoids suppress antibody and complement binding, upregulate interleukin (IL)-10 expression, and downregulate IL-2, IL-6, and interferon-gamma synthesis by T cells. They have traditionally been the cornerstone of immunosuppression, and they remain the first line of initial therapy and treatment of acute allograft rejection in many centers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-acute-cellular-rejection-of-the-liver-allograft\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of acute cellular rejection of the liver allograft&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Four steroid formulations are used commonly in transplantation: <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a>. These drugs have different relative potencies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F52276\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52276 \">table 2</a>). Steroid use varies among transplant centers, and there is no agreement on an ideal protocol. The protocol at Baylor College of Medicine is shown in the table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F53128\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53128 \">table 3</a>). Another common regimen is a 1 gram bolus of methylprednisolone during the anhepatic phase, followed by 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> intravenously. Once the patient is able to take oral medications, <span class=\"nowrap\">he/she</span> is switched to prednisone 20 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>. Tapering to zero is usually achieved over three to six months, although some centers leave patients on 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> indefinitely.</p><p>Steroids are associated with a number of side effects including diabetes, fluid retention, hypertension, emotional lability, hyperlipidemia, cosmetic changes (acne, buffalo hump, etc), poor wound healing, susceptibility to infection, visual changes, cataracts, and osteopenia, and they may cause adrenal suppression that may persist up to the time of weaning.</p><p>In addition to the side effects, steroid therapy increases hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication. The basis of this increase is controversial. Steroids may drive replication directly, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> they may permit more effective replication through immunosuppression. In vitro studies using a replicon system (which avoids the effect of the immune system) have yielded conflicting results. The controversy about steroid avoidance and tapering in HCV-infected patients is discussed below, but it is mostly of historical interest with the availability of potent direct acting antiviral agents. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoids and HCV'</a> below.)</p><p>Given the problems with glucocorticoids, many centers try to wean from steroids as early as possible. This must be done cautiously since rapid steroid withdrawal can precipitate a flare of an underlying condition (eg, autoimmune hepatitis, inflammatory bowel disease, or hepatitis) or an episode of rejection. A meta-analysis looked at 16 randomized trials that compared postoperative glucocorticoid avoidance or withdrawal with glucocorticoid-containing immunosuppression. There were no differences detected in mortality, graft loss, or infection rates when postoperative glucocorticoid avoidance or withdrawal was compared with glucocorticoid-containing immunosuppression. However, acute rejection and glucocorticoid-resistant rejection were more common with glucocorticoid avoidance or withdrawal (relative risk [RR] 1.33, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.64, and RR 2.14, 95% CI 1.13 to 4.02, respectively). Diabetes mellitus and hypertension occurred less often with glucocorticoid avoidance or withdrawal (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.99 and RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.65 to 0.90, respectively). However, all of the studies included in the analysis were at high risk of bias.</p><p>A possible alternative to traditional glucocorticoids is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=budesonide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">budesonide</a>. Budesonide is a glucocorticoid with reduced systemic effects because of high first-pass hepatic metabolism. Budesonide is used commonly to treat inflammatory bowel disease and has proven effective in the management of autoimmune hepatitis. Its use in liver transplantation is attractive because of the high frequency of post-transplant diabetes, especially in patients transplanted for hepatitis C. One study reported three post-orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) patients treated with budesonide with apparent success. While intriguing, further studies are needed before budesonide can be recommended as an anti-rejection agent.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Glucocorticoids and HCV</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cirrhosis secondary to HCV infection has become the leading indication for OLT in the United States. The ability of steroids to increase HCV replication has created concern about their use in these patients. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-natural-history-of-chronic-hepatitis-c-virus-infection#H18\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and natural history of chronic hepatitis C virus infection&quot;, section on 'Immunosuppressed hosts'</a>.)</p><p>As a general rule, three options exist with regard to glucocorticoid use in patients with HCV:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Maintain low-dose steroids indefinitely (approximately 5 mg per day)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Taper steroids slowly</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Avoid steroids</p><p/><p>Most centers use the second strategy, although the first and third continue to be studied. If steroids are used, a flare of HCV infection with an increased viral load and increased aminotransferases should be anticipated during tapering. Slower tapering, addition of another immunosuppressive agent, and use of antiviral therapy are all strategies undergoing evaluation. </p><p>Slow steroid tapering was supported by a prospective multicenter study in HCV-infected liver transplantation recipients that compared rapid steroid tapering and withdrawal (within three months of transplantation) with slow tapering and withdrawal (over two years). Rapid tapering was significantly more likely to be associated with the development of advanced fibrosis, suggesting that abrupt changes in glucocorticoid dosing, including boluses and rapid discontinuation, may negatively impact the natural history of chronic hepatitis C post-transplantation.</p><p>Steroid-free immunosuppression is possible. It has the theoretical advantage of avoiding a steroid-related increase in viral replication with a subsequent flare during steroid withdrawal. The actual risk of steroid use in the setting of transplantation is incompletely understood. Studies have used a variety of designs and immunosuppression regimens, and rejection itself has a role in virus-induced cirrhosis with effects on long-term graft and patient survival.</p><p>Randomized trials have had variable results, as illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One randomized trial described outcomes of a glucocorticoid-free regimen involving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=daclizumab-withdrawn-from-market-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">daclizumab</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil (MMF), which was compared with tacrolimus and glucocorticoids, or tacrolimus, glucocorticoids, and MMF in 295 HCV RNA-positive liver transplantation recipients. After two years of follow-up, there were no differences in acute rejection, patient or graft survival, or the rate of HCV recurrence among the treatment arms. Thus, the study supports the feasibility of steroid-free maintenance immunosuppression in HCV-infected patients, but its benefit on HCV recurrence was not apparent, at least in the short term. A second trial addressed rejection and recurrent HCV in 89 patients assigned either to dual therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basiliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">basiliximab</a> or to triple therapy with cyclosporine, basiliximab, and a steroid. Recurrent HCV infection was seen in 97 percent of patients in both groups, and viral loads at 6, 12, and 24 months were not statistically different. Protocol biopsies at 6, 12, and 24 months showed similar rates of rejection (17 to 21 percent). Portal inflammation and fibrosis scores were higher in the steroid group at two years, although only portal inflammation reached statistical significance.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A second trial with 103 patients examined <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> monotherapy versus triple therapy (tacrolimus, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, and tapering <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a>) who were followed for a median of 96 months. In that study, Ishak stage <span class=\"nowrap\">4/6</span> fibrosis was reached in more patients in the monotherapy group compared with the triple therapy group (35 versus 22 percent).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A third trial with 75 patients compared <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> plus a glucocorticoid with tacrolimus plus MMF. Outcomes of interest included biopsy-proven acute rejection resistant to two rounds of steroid pulse therapy, histologic recurrence of HCV, hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence, retransplantation, and death. Event-free survival rates at one, three, and five years were similar between the <span class=\"nowrap\">tacrolimus/glucocorticoid</span> group and the <span class=\"nowrap\">tacrolimus/MMF</span> group (38 versus 25 percent, 12 versus 18 percent, and 6 versus 15 percent, respectively).</p><p/><p>A 2009 meta-analysis included 21 randomized controlled trials with 2590 patients. In that analysis, patients who did not receive steroids appeared to benefit with regard to overall acute rejection (if the steroid was replaced with an alternative agent), severe acute rejection, development of de novo diabetes mellitus, cytomegalovirus infection, cholesterol levels, and the number of patients who received the allocated treatment. In patients with HCV, the steroid-free protocols were associated with lower rates of HCV recurrence, acute graft hepatitis, and treatment failure.</p><p>In addition to potential benefits in patients with HCV, steroid-free regimens may also improve growth patterns in children.</p><p>While steroid-free immunosuppression is feasible, we remain unconvinced that these regimens confer sufficient value to warrant a change in protocol at any given transplant center for the following reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trials cannot necessarily be compared since steroid dosing and tapering regimens vary widely.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We rarely see rejection using the steroid protocol discussed above. In our experience, shorter tapering protocols have been associated with higher rates of rejection, including steroid-resistant rejection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The steroid-free regimens use expensive drugs that are not always available. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=daclizumab-withdrawn-from-market-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Daclizumab</a> is no longer manufactured. (See <a href=\"#H29\" class=\"local\">'Basiliximab and daclizumab'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aggressive immunosuppression may have late consequences such as post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">CALCINEURIN INHIBITORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The early challenges to successful liver transplantation included surgical technique, organ preservation, and immunosuppression. As surgical technique improved, the need for better immunosuppression became more obvious. A report published in 1980 described one-year survival of only 26 percent. The introduction of the calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> A the following year marked a turning point in liver transplantation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Cyclosporine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Cyclosporine</a>, a peptide derived from the fungus <em>Cylindrocarpon lucidum</em>, is a potent immunosuppressive agent. It inhibits T-cell activation by binding intracellular cyclophilin, thus reducing calcineurin activation. Without calcineurin, the nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) does not translocate to the nucleus, and interleukin (IL)-2 production (along with a number of other genes) is shut down. The result is a markedly diminished T-cell response to class I and class II antigens, and a significant reduction in the rejection cascade.</p><p>The impact of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> was illustrated in an early report in which one- and five-year survival rates with &quot;conventional&quot; immunosuppression (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a>) were 33 and 20 percent, respectively, while the survival rates with cyclosporine plus prednisone were 70 and 63 percent, respectively. Cyclosporine subsequently became first-line therapy, and the first 1000 cases done at the University of Pittsburgh were described in a report in 1988.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Cyclosporine</a> was initially formulated as Sandimmune, a corn oil-based preparation with inconsistent absorption, especially in the absence of bile flow. Accurate dosing was difficult, and serum drug levels varied with meals. In addition, any change in bile flow (eg, with rejection episodes or biliary complications) caused a change in cyclosporine absorption. This is clearly a problem after liver transplantation, so the nonaqueous, microemulsified version (Neoral) has become the preferred formulation.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Cyclosporine</a> can be administered intravenously, although it is usually given orally as a tablet or an oral suspension (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F74498\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74498 \">table 4</a>). The intravenous dose is approximately 30 percent of the oral dose because of improved bioavailability, and because it is given as a continuous infusion. All of the comments below regarding oral administration are based on the Neoral formulation of cyclosporine.</p><p>After oral administration, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> is variably absorbed in the jejunum and enters the lymphatic system. Peak blood levels are achieved in two to four hours, and the drug is widely distributed with highest concentrations in adipose, pancreatic, adrenal, renal, and hepatic tissues. The average half-life is 15 hours but ranges widely (10 to 40 hours). Cyclosporine is cleared in the bile after extensive metabolism in the liver by CYP3A4. The metabolites have little immunosuppressive activity. CYP3A4 activity (and, therefore, blood cyclosporine levels) depends upon genetic and environmental factors including gene polymorphisms, graft function, hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication, and certain foods and drugs (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F110436\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef110436 \">table 1</a>).</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Cyclosporine</a> levels should be monitored frequently in the peritransplant period (typically daily), with decreasing frequency as graft function stabilizes and rejection becomes less of a threat. Patients who are stable can be monitored monthly, but levels should be checked more frequently if they develop an acute illness or start taking a potentially interfering drug. Several drugs commonly affect CNI levels. The goal therapeutic level of cyclosporine is usually 200 to 250 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> in the first three months after transplantation, but is typically tapered to 80 to 120 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> by 12 months.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Cyclosporine</a> levels should be monitored closely, and patients should be monitored for renal toxicity, hypertension, hyperkalemia, and hypomagnesemia. Potassium-sparing diuretics and potentially nephrotoxic drugs should be avoided if possible. Neurological toxicity may include altered mental status, polyneuropathy, dysarthria, myoclonus, seizures, hallucinations, and cortical blindness. Other common problems include hyperlipidemia, gingival hyperplasia, and hirsutism.

A year later, the same group described use of FK506 as salvage therapy in patients who had failed <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>. Within approximately five years, tacrolimus would overtake cyclosporine as the mainstay in liver transplantation.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Tacrolimus</a> (Prograf) is a macrolide compound originally isolated from <em>Streptomyces tsukubaensis</em>. It inhibits IL-2 and interferon-gamma production and is 100 times more potent than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>. Oral bioavailability is variable (5 to 67 percent), and an oral dose of 0.15 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> results in a peak concentration of 0.4 to 3.7 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span>. Like cyclosporine, tacrolimus is metabolized in the liver via CYP3A4 and is not removed by dialysis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Cyclosporine versus tacrolimus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>By the mid-1990s, most centers agreed that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> was associated with superior graft and patient survival. A criticism of the early studies was their use of oil-based <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, raising the question of bioavailability versus efficacy. A landmark study greatly influenced thinking on the subject. The authors compared the efficacy of tacrolimus versus microemulsified cyclosporine in 606 patients undergoing first orthotopic liver transplant using a composite primary endpoint of death, retransplantation, or &quot;treatment failure for immunological reasons (TFIR).&quot; The study was an open-label, randomized design, and all patients received concomitant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>. TFIR was defined as biopsy-proven rejection requiring a change from protocol immunosuppression including more than one cycle of increased steroid or any increased immunosuppression, including antilymphocyte preparation or investigational drug. The justification for using TFIR as an endpoint was to avoid the distorting effect of tacrolimus rescue in patients who were failing cyclosporine therapy.

In addition, more patients in the tacrolimus group survived without an episode of significant rejection.</p><p>The results of the study were updated with a two-year extension of the randomization protocol. <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Tacrolimus</a> remained superior for the composite endpoint (RR 0.79; 95% CI 0.60-0.95), although the individual endpoints of freedom from death or retransplantation were no longer statistically significant. Significantly more patients randomized to tacrolimus were alive with their original graft and on their assigned medication compared with the <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> group (62 versus 42 percent). Six patients were switched from tacrolimus to cyclosporine, while 17 were switched from cyclosporine to tacrolimus (five for graft rejection not meeting endpoint criteria).</p><p>Multiple subsequent studies have been performed; the superiority of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> over <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> was confirmed in a meta-analysis of 16 randomized clinical trials. Tacrolimus was superior when analyzed for survival, graft loss, acute rejection, and steroid-resistant rejection in the first year (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F77871\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77871 \">table 5</a>). The incidence of lymphoproliferative disease was similar for the two groups, and de novo diabetes mellitus was more common in the tacrolimus group. More patients stopped cyclosporine than tacrolimus. The authors estimated that treating 100 patients with tacrolimus versus cyclosporine would avoid rejection, steroid-resistant rejection, graft loss, and death in nine, seven, five, and two patients, respectively, but that four additional patients would develop diabetes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Tacrolimus dosing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Tacrolimus</a> dosing should be individualized. We usually start with a low dose (0.5 to 1 mg every 12 hours) on postoperative day 1, and aim for a level of 7 to 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> by the end of the first week. We use lower dosing, often with the addition of an auxiliary agent like <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil (MMF) or a monoclonal antibody in patients with preoperative renal impairment. It is important to attain adequate tacrolimus levels quickly. In a study of 493 liver transplantation recipients who were treated with tacrolimus as their primary immunosuppression, patients with trough tacrolimus levels &gt;7 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> at the time of a protocol liver biopsy (mean 6 days after transplantation) had lower rates of moderate or severe rejection compared with those who had lower levels (24 versus 41 percent). In addition, patients with mean levels between 7 and 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> within 15 days after liver transplantation had lower rates of graft loss during follow-up compared with patients who had trough levels &lt;7 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> or 10 to 15 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> (relative risks of 2.32 and 2.17, respectively). These findings suggest that in the early post-transplantation period, a tacrolimus level between 7 and 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> is associated with improved outcomes. However, it must be kept in mind that because the study was not a randomized trial, it is at risk for bias and confounding.</p><p>A level of 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> is usually satisfactory after six months, and maintenance at a level of 4 to 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/mL</span> is common beyond one year. We aim for higher levels in patients who are transplanted for autoimmune liver diseases, including primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and primary sclerosing cholangitis. Patients transplanted for alcoholic liver disease or hemochromatosis usually tolerate low levels of CNIs after their initial recovery. With improved survival, our goal is to use as little immunosuppression as possible to minimize the known long-term complications of these drugs, including renal insufficiency and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Calcineurin inhibitors and renal failure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CNI-induced renal failure is a serious problem after orthotopic liver transplant (OLT). The problem has been exacerbated by the switch to a MELD-based organ allocation system, which is weighted towards higher serum creatinine. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=model-for-end-stage-liver-disease-meld\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Model for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>A number of strategies, including switching to mammalian (mechanistic) target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors or using alternative supplemental immunosuppressive agents, have been tried. A retrospective analysis of patients who received either dual therapy with a CNI and a steroid (n = 3884) or triple therapy with a CNI, steroid, and MMF (n = 4946 patients) found that triple therapy was associated with a 6 percent lower adjusted risk of progressive renal disease as well as lower risk of death. Progressive renal disease was defined as a 25 percent decline in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) based on the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) study formula. The authors hypothesized that MMF improved renal function by lowering CNI dosing and via a direct nephroprotective effect.</p><p>A prospective, multicenter trial compared standard dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> to low dose and delayed tacrolimus with the primary endpoint of a change in eGFR (Cockroft-Gault formula) at 52 weeks.

Biopsy-proven acute rejection rates were 28, 29, and 19 percent, respectively. Patient and graft survival were similar among the groups. This study suggests that the kidney is particularly vulnerable to injury in the immediate post-OLT period. Delayed CNI dosing reduced, but did not eliminate, renal injury.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">Calcineurin inhibitors and HCV</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The selection of a specific calcineurin inhibitor in liver transplant recipients with HCV remains unclear. A theoretical advantage of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> is that it inhibits HCV replication in vitro. Whether this translates into a clinical benefit has not been established since studies have produced disparate results as illustrated by the following examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A prospective, multicenter trial in HCV liver transplant recipients compared <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> over 12 months from the time of transplant.

These studies were all of at least one-year duration and included data on mortality, graft loss, and acute rejection, but were limited in other endpoints (eg, fibrosis) related to HCV. There were no significant differences in patient mortality, graft survival, or biopsy-proven rejection. Fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis, a severe form of recurrent HCV, was found in only five patients in the tacrolimus arm and two in the cyclosporine arm. Similar results were noted in a second meta-analysis that included nine studies.</p><p/><p>The mixed data described above have left the choice of CNI open-ended, but <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> is now used less frequently in liver transplant recipients. Careful monitoring of CNI levels may be more important than the actual drug selected. HCV replication decreases CNI metabolism, resulting in higher drug levels despite dose reductions. The higher levels may be due to downregulation of CYP3A4, resulting in impaired clearance of the drug. As a result, careful monitoring of CNI levels in HCV transplant recipients is warranted.</p><p>Conversely, when direct acting antiviral agents are used to treat recurrent hepatitis, we have noticed that CNI levels tend to decline (sometimes precipitously). The cause is most likely enhanced drug metabolism in uninfected hepatocytes. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h2\">Summary on the role of calcineurin inhibitors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Cyclosporine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> are potent immunosuppressive agents. Their availability has allowed us to shift our focus from acute cellular rejection and short-term post-transplant survival to long-term management of complications. They have similar adverse effects including nephrotoxicity, neurotoxicity, and electrolyte abnormalities, and both can be monitored with drug levels.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Tacrolimus</a> is superior in terms of preventing acute rejection, steroid-resistant rejection, graft loss, and postoperative death. These findings have made tacrolimus first line therapy in most liver transplant centers despite its higher association with post-transplant diabetes mellitus. Diabetes is a significant concern since it will probably contribute to the progressive renal failure that may be seen in long-term survivors.</p><p>Current thinking is that significant immunosuppression is needed in the immediate post-transplant period. Beyond this period, the complications of excessive immunosuppression outweigh the ever decreasing risk of organ rejection. With careful monitoring, low doses of immunosuppression are usually well tolerated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">INHIBITORS OF MAMMALIAN (MECHANISTIC) TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN (MTOR)</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H18\"><span class=\"h2\">Sirolimus</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Sirolimus</a> (Rapamune), a macrolide antibiotic produced by <em>Streptomyces hygroscopicus</em>, is a potent immunosuppressive agent approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for renal transplantation in 1999. It is structurally similar to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> and binds the same target (FK-binding protein) but does not inhibit calcineurin. Instead, it blocks the transduction signal from the IL-2 receptor, thus inhibiting T- and B-cell proliferation. Its advantage over the calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) is its freedom from nephrotoxicity and neurotoxicity. However, side effects of sirolimus have relegated it to the status of an important second-line drug. (See <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Side effects'</a> below.)</p><p>The effectiveness of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a> was illustrated in an early report of its use in 15 patients undergoing liver transplantation. Sirolimus was used as a single agent or as part of dual (sirolimus and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>) or triple therapy (sirolimus, cyclosporine, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisolone</a>). Rejection was seen more commonly with monotherapy, rarely with dual therapy, and not at all with triple therapy. In addition, all patients were on sirolimus monotherapy by three months. Only 3 of the 15 patients discontinued sirolimus: one for hyperlipidemia, one for taste perversion, and one for <em>Pneumocystis</em> pneumonia.</p><p>Although <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a> binds its target (FK-binding protein) with higher affinity than <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a>, the two drugs act synergistically, rather than competitively, to prevent rejection. This led to speculation that a low-dose combination strategy might reduce the incidence of tacrolimus-associated problems. In a study of 56 patients on this combination, patient and graft survival at 23 months were 93 and 91 percent, respectively. One case of hepatic artery thrombosis was observed in this series.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Sirolimus</a> may be especially useful as a substitute in cases of CNI-intolerance (primarily renal failure and neurotoxicity). However, its benefits in renal failure remain unsettled. While retrospective analyses did not show improved renal function in patients switched to sirolimus, a small randomized controlled trial showed improvement. In the randomized trial, transplant recipients with underlying renal disease were switched to sirolimus at least six months after liver transplant. The glomerular filtration rate improved within three months. However, long-term outcomes were not reported, and two patients in the sirolimus arm developed acute rejection.</p><p>A retrospective analysis showed no benefit for renal function when patients with chronic renal insufficiency were switched from CNIs to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a>. This study suggests that renal dysfunction from CNIs becomes irreversible at some point, and highlights the importance of CNI optimization. Similarly, another study showed that early conversion (less than 90 days) to sirolimus was associated with improved renal function, while late conversion was of limited benefit.</p><p>A systematic review that included 11 studies found a small (3.4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min),</span> nonsignificant increase in glomerular filtration rate after one year of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a> use in patients who received sirolimus as primary immunosuppression due to renal insufficiency or who were switched to sirolimus from another regimen due to nephrotoxicity. However, sirolimus use was associated with higher rates of infection, rash, ulcers, and discontinuation of therapy. Sirolimus was not associated with an increased risk of graft failure or death, though the data reporting for these outcomes were incomplete.</p><p>Larger trials with longer follow-up are needed to settle the issue and to determine whether the potential improvement in renal function outweighs a possible increased risk of rejection.</p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Sirolimus</a> has also been proposed as a better choice for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma because of its antiproliferative activity. This benefit has yet to be proven in prospective trials. Finally, although not supported by publications, many transplant centers find that sirolimus is inadequate as monotherapy and routinely add a second agent when switching from a CNI for any reason.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Side effects</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Side effects of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a> reported in the postoperative period include hepatic artery thrombosis, delayed wound healing, and incisional hernias, while chronic use has been associated with hyperlipidemia, bone marrow suppression, mouth ulcers, skin rashes, albuminuria, and pneumonia. These risks are difficult to quantify because the incidence (and even the presence) of side effects varies widely by report. In 2008, the FDA updated the labeling of sirolimus to include a <a href=\"http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2008/021083s033,021110s043lbl.pdf&amp;token=LL+A9P3M8b0NgwWmydN7jGLsQuekKkzNnShefAtDiAP3XsgFsxfwgAe9cl1+cGtrB54SsLWYIyrBNj5USTuf0g1HDIdf+weQHrJaepLN8v8gFGMDnOLsA5RqejrKNvj7&amp;TOPIC_ID=4586\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">boxed warning</a> stating that the use of sirolimus was associated with excess mortality, graft loss, and hepatic artery thrombosis following liver transplantation, and that its use de novo in liver transplantation recipients was not recommended.</p><p>As an example, one report showed that <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a> was more likely to cause hyperlipidemia when administered with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a> than with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> (30 versus 6 percent for hypercholesterolemia, 33 versus 3 percent for hypertriglyceridemia).

Cells depleted of GMP cannot synthesize guanine triphosphate (GTP) or deoxy guanine triphosphate (d-GTP) and therefore cannot replicate. Most mammalian cells are able to maintain GMP levels through the purine salvage pathway. However, lymphocytes lack a key enzyme of the guanine salvage pathway (hypoxanthine-guanine phosphoribosyltransferase), and cannot overcome the MPA-induced block. As a result, MPA selectively inhibits the proliferation of both B and T lymphocytes.</p><p>Reports on the use of MMF in liver transplantation began to appear in the late 1990s. MMF does not cause neurotoxicity or nephrotoxicity, and is widely used as a calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)- or steroid-sparing agent. The most common side effects are bone marrow suppression and gastrointestinal complaints, including abdominal pain, ileus, nausea, vomiting, and oral ulceration. These symptoms are usually dose-related and improve with temporary or permanent dose reduction. Usual dosing is 1 g twice daily. Patients may tolerate the drug better if it is initially dosed at 500 mg twice daily or 500 mg four times daily. Myfortic (mycophenolic acid) is formulated as 360 mg tablets and is typically given as two tablets (720 mg) orally every 12 hours. Food may interfere with absorption of the drugs, so they should be taken one hour before or two hours after meals.</p><p>The role of MMF is similar to that of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a> in that it is used to reduce or discontinue CNI dosing in order to treat side effects. Studies suggest MMF monotherapy may be effective in certain situations long after liver transplantation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A randomized trial assigned 150 patients who had received a liver transplantation and were maintained on a CNI to either continued therapy with a CNI or to MMF monotherapy. The mean time between liver transplantation and study enrollment was 4.9 years for patients assigned to continued CNI therapy, and 5.7 years for those assigned to MMF. After five years of follow-up, there were no significant differences between those who continued on a CNI and those who were switched to MMF with regard to chronic rejection or patient survival (0 verus 0 percent and 94 verus 90 percent, respectively). There was a trend toward lower acute rejection rates in the CNI group (3 versus 11 percent, p = 0.055). All patients with acute rejection were successfully treated with steroid-pulse therapy. Among patients with renal insufficiency, renal function improved in those switched to MMF. There were no significant differences between the groups with regard to malignancy rates or to adverse cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, or neurologic events.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a prospective open-label study, 19 patients at the University of Washington were switched from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> to MMF with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cyclosporine</a>, which was then tapered. After five years, seven patients remained off cyclosporine, and six patients were on MMF monotherapy. Serum creatinine in the seven patients off cyclosporine decreased significantly (from 2.2 to 1.9 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL),</span> while creatinine clearance increased significantly (from 38 to 47 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min)</span>. Control of arterial hypertension also improved. MMF appeared to be well tolerated, although six patients required dose reductions.</p><p/><p>The added immunosuppression of MMF may also allow for the early discontinuation or avoidance of steroids. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoids and HCV'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H65730794\"><span class=\"h2\">Azathioprine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Azathioprine</a> is a prodrug of 6-mercaptopurine, which is an antimetabolite that inhibits purine synthesis. By preventing the de novo synthesis of purines, and thus interfering with RNA and DNA synthesis, azathioprine inhibits the replication of T and B cells. It is typically given at a dose of 1.5 to 2.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span>. Side effects include bone marrow suppression, nausea, vomiting, pancreatitis, hepatotoxicity, and neoplasia. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pharmacology-and-side-effects-of-azathioprine-when-used-in-rheumatic-diseases#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pharmacology and side effects of azathioprine when used in rheumatic diseases&quot;, section on 'Adverse effects'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h1\">ANTIBODY THERAPY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because T and B cells express specific antigens on their cell surfaces, antibodies to these markers can be used to deplete populations of cells. The initial concept of lymphoid depletion by thoracic duct fistula gave way to the more elegant method of antithymocyte globulin preparations, now refined to include humanized antibodies and monoclonal antibodies against specific cell surface proteins such as the interleukin (IL)-2 receptor.</p><p>These agents are not used routinely in liver transplantation, but have an important role in treating steroid-resistant rejection and as calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)-sparing agents in the immediate post-transplant period. Antibody therapy may also permit steroid free immunosuppression regimens if needed. We generally use antibody preparations in the rare case of steroid-resistant rejection and in situations where we wish to minimize CNI dosing, such as in patients with pretransplant renal failure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-acute-cellular-rejection-of-the-liver-allograft#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of acute cellular rejection of the liver allograft&quot;, section on 'Glucocorticoid-resistant rejection'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H26\"><span class=\"h2\">Polyclonal antibodies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Antithymocyte globulin (ATG, thymoglobulin) and antilymphocyte globulin (ALG) are prepared by immunizing animals against mixed populations of thymocytes. The resulting preparations have antibodies to multiple T-cell antigens including CD2, CD3, CD4, and CD8. They are administered via a central line and result in profound lymphopenia by complement-mediated cell lysis and uptake of opsonized cells. Repopulation occurs within 3 to 10 days.</p><p>Polyclonal antibodies have been used for induction of immunosuppression or treatment of steroid-resistant rejection. A review of the Scientific Registry of Transplant Recipient (SRTR) data between 1993 and 2003 showed that antibodies were used commonly in kidney, <span class=\"nowrap\">kidney/pancreas,</span> and intestinal transplants, but uncommonly (&lt;20 percent) in liver transplantation. The authors also noted a shift from muromonab-CD3 and horse ATG to rabbit ATG and anti-IL-2 receptor antagonists. (See <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Muromonab-CD3 (OKT3)'</a> below.)</p><p>More recently, a large series examined the efficacy of rabbit ATG following liver transplantation. The series included 500 patients who received a single dose of solumedrol followed by ATG induction. Patients also received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mycophenolate-mofetil-cellcept-and-enteric-coated-mycophenolate-sodium-myfortic-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mycophenolate</a> mofetil and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sirolimus</a>. The tacrolimus or sirolimus was weaned after three months. After one year, patient and graft survival rates were 93 and 90 percent, respectively. Rejection occurred in 114 patients (23 percent) and 33 patients required glucocorticoids (7 percent).</p><p>Complications with these agents include fever, chills, rash, anemia, thrombocytopenia, serum sickness, and nephritis. Although our personal preference is to use monoclonal antibodies when necessary, some reports suggest that polyclonal antibodies are still in use in pediatric and adult patients undergoing liver transplantation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h2\">Monoclonal antibodies</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H28\"><span class=\"h3\">Muromonab-CD3 (OKT3)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>OKT3 (Orthoclone OKT3) was the first monoclonal antibody approved for use in solid organ transplantation. It is directed against the CD3-antigen complex on mature T cells. Binding this receptor causes internalization of the receptor followed by opsonization and removal of T cells from the circulation. It also blocks killer T-cell activity in the graft.</p><p>OKT3 was an early agent in managing steroid-resistant rejection. An illustrative trial included 28 patients with steroid-resistant rejection who were randomly assigned to further steroid treatment versus OKT3. In the steroid group, 3 out of 13 patients responded promptly to further <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methylprednisolone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methylprednisolone</a> and the remaining 10 patients were switched to OKT3 rescue after failing to respond to steroids. Of these 10 patients, nine responded to OKT3, and seven were well at 1- to 17-months follow-up. In the OKT3 group, 11 of 15 responded within 72 hours. Two patients with an inadequate response to OKT3 were rescued with steroids, one was retransplanted, and one died of sepsis following a biliary fistula.</p><p>The standard dose of OKT3 is 5 mg intravenous (IV) daily for 10 to 14 days. The initial two to three doses typically cause a cytokine release syndrome characterized by fever, chills, headache, chest pain, tachycardia, dyspnea, wheezing, nausea, and vomiting. Onset is usually within an hour of the infusion, and symptoms usually resolve in four to six hours. A slower infusion rate along with pretreatment with 1 g <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydrocortisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydrocortisone</a> (first dose only), 650 mg <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>, and 25 mg <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diphenhydramine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">diphenhydramine</a> has been recommended, but there is no agreement on a standard pretreatment protocol. Pulmonary edema should be excluded with a chest radiograph prior to infusion, and symptoms should be treated aggressively with diuretics. Asymptomatic meningitis usually responds to 100 mg hydrocortisone prior to each infusion.</p><p>Successful OKT treatment is associated with a rapid decline in CD3-positive T cells from approximately 60 to less than 5 percent. Failure of this decline or a fall followed by a rapid rise indicates the appearance of blocking antibodies. A review of the literature suggested close monitoring of the absolute neutrophil count (ANC). The authors recommended that patients whose ANC did not decline below 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/mL</span> be treated with a double dose of OKT3 to overwhelm the developing antibodies.</p><p>The efficacy of OKT3 is tempered by concern about complications, mainly worse outcomes in patients with recurrent hepatitis C and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD). The occurrence of PTLD may be higher in patients who are transplanted for HCV, although probably not as high as the 7 percent reported in one small series (57 patients with HCV, 127 without HCV). In the five patients with PTLD, four were transplanted for HCV, and all five had received OKT3 induction.</p><p>Two large single-center series showed remarkably similar incidences of PTLD: 41 out of 1421 patients (3 percent) in a series from Dallas and 37 out of 1421 patients (3 percent) in a series from the Mayo Clinic. The Dallas group showed no relationship to OKT3 use or severity of rejection, but the Mayo study showed a significant correlation with OKT3 (HR = 3.6), high dose steroids (HR = 4.5), or either (HR = 3.6).</p><p>Concern about the danger of PTLD, especially in the setting of HCV infection, was reflected in a survey of North American transplant centers conducted in 1998 and repeated in 2003; a general trend toward reduced use of OKT3 in HCV-infected patients was observed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H29\"><span class=\"h3\">Basiliximab and daclizumab</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=basiliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Basiliximab</a> (Simulect) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=daclizumab-withdrawn-from-market-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">daclizumab</a> (Zenapax) are humanized monoclonal antibodies against the IL-2 receptor. Blockade of the IL-2 receptor prevents T-cell proliferation. The chimeric structure makes both preparations less immunogenic than OKT3, and they have longer half-lives and are better tolerated. Basiliximab, for example, has an elimination half-life of 4.1&plusmn;2.1 days, and complete saturation of interleukin-2 receptor alpha-chain was maintained as long as serum concentrations exceeded 0.1 <span class=\"nowrap\">microgram/mL</span>. The mean duration of receptor saturation was 23 <span class=\"nowrap\">+/-</span> 7 days after transplantation (range of 13 to 41 days). The half-life may be decreased by the presence of bleeding or ascites.</p><p>Similar efficacy has been demonstrated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=daclizumab-withdrawn-from-market-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">daclizumab</a> dosed at 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> on post-orthotopic liver transplant (OLT) days 1 and 3, and 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> on day 8. CD25 suppression was confirmed through day 30, and maximal effects were noted with a daclizumab concentration of at least 5 <span class=\"nowrap\">micrograms/mL</span>. Similarly, a nonrandomized study of daclizumab 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> before engraftment and 1 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> on day 5 post-OLT resulted in a much lower rejection rate in the first six months (18 versus 40 percent), marked improvement in renal function, and no increase in cytomegalovirus (CMV) or infectious complications when compared with a control group treated with standard immunosuppression. Daclizumab was removed from the market in 2009 for commercial reasons; no clinical issues were identified, and we continue to believe that daclizumab is an excellent drug.</p><p>Antibodies can be used to reduce CNI use in patients with pre-OLT renal disease or to minimize steroid use. In one report with median follow-up of 22 months, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=basiliximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">basiliximab</a> controlled steroid-resistant rejection after OLT in five out of seven children.</p><p>Few controlled trials have compared contemporary immunosuppressive regimens involving these agents. One randomized multicenter study compared <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tacrolimus</a> plus steroids (T+S; 347 patients) to a steroid-free tacrolimus plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=daclizumab-withdrawn-from-market-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">daclizumab</a> group (T+D; 351 patients). The incidence of biopsy-confirmed glucocorticoid-resistant acute rejection was higher in the T+S group (6 versus 3 percent), although graft and patient survival were comparable. The overall adverse event profiles were similar, but the incidences of diabetes mellitus (15 versus 6 percent) and CMV infection (12 versus 5 percent) were significantly higher in the T+S group. Mean cholesterol levels increased by 16 percent in the T+S group, but were unchanged in the T+D group.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H30\"><span class=\"h1\">EXPERIMENTAL AGENTS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31\"><span class=\"h2\">Belatacept (LEA29Y)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span><a href=\"topic.htm?path=belatacept-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">Belatacept</a> is a high affinity fusion protein that binds <span class=\"nowrap\">CD80/86</span> on antigen-presenting cells (APCs).

The drug is given as a monthly infusion and may permit immunosuppression without nephrotoxicity. Several reports confirm its effectiveness in renal transplantation, but an increased rate of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (especially involving the central nervous system) has confined its use to Epstein-Barr virus-positive recipients.

It is approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of chronic B-cell lymphocytic leukemia, but it has also been used for immunosuppression following solid organ transplantation. In liver transplantation, alemtuzumab has been proposed as a method to decrease steroid and calcineurin inhibitor use.

Intravenous administration of calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) is associated with a higher risk of nephrotoxicity and should be avoided if possible. In addition, clinicians should be careful to check for potential drug interactions with medications used around the time of surgery (eg, antimicrobials or antifungals). The patient's transplant hepatologist should be consulted prior to making any changes to the immunosuppression regimen. (See <a href=\"#H1560423\" class=\"local\">'Drug interactions'</a> above.)</p><p>In patients receiving glucocorticoids, additional perioperative glucocorticoid coverage should be considered for patients likely to have suppression of their hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (eg, those on long-term, higher dose glucocorticoids).

However, because of the risk of graft rejection and because it is not yet clear which patients are good candidates for stopping immunosuppression, additional studies are needed before recommending attempts at stopping immunosuppression. We have seen a number of fatal rejections in patients who stopped immunosuppression without medical supervision, including patients many years post-orthotopic liver transplant. We therefore never recommend stopping all immunosuppression.</p><p>Discontinuing immunosuppression was examined in a study of 24 patients without active viral hepatitis or autoimmune disease who had side effects from immunosuppression or who were at high risk for developing de novo malignancy. The patients underwent gradual reduction of their immunosuppression. Patients who had normal liver function tests following withdrawal of immunosuppression were considered to be tolerant. After a median of 14 months, 15 patients (63 percent) were tolerant. The remaining nine patients could not have their immunosuppression completely withdrawn because of abnormal liver tests. In these patients, immunosuppression was increased with normalization of liver function in seven patients. The remaining two patients underwent liver biopsy. One had mild chronic rejection, and one had acute rejection that was treated with glucocorticoids. A longer median interval between transplantation and inclusion in the study was associated with tolerance (156 months for patients who developed immunotolerance versus 71 months for those who did not). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Organ rejection is a multistep process that includes alloantigen recognition, lymphocyte activation, clonal expansion, and graft inflammation.
