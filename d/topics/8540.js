In individuals with T1DM, the counterregulatory hormone response often becomes blunted over time, so that the glucagon response is impaired and the epinephrine surge may be attenuated; this increases the risk of persistent hypoglycemia. Impairment of the epinephrine response occurs in 30 percent or more of children and adolescents whose diabetes is well controlled [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].

Behavioral changes also occur and are probably a consequence of adrenergic and neuroglycopenic responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Clinicians should inquire about symptoms of hypoglycemia during the routine care of a child with T1DM (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F97226\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef97226 \">table 1</a>). </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adrenergic symptoms &ndash; Tremor, pallor, rapid heart rate, palpitations, and diaphoresis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Neuroglycopenic symptoms &ndash; Fatigue, lethargy, headaches, behavior changes, drowsiness, unconsciousness, seizures, or coma. The severity of the neuroglycopenic symptoms increases with the severity of hypoglycemia and resultant central nervous system energy deprivation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Behavioral symptoms &ndash; Behavioral symptoms include irritability, agitation, erratic behavior, quietness or tantrums, and are most common in younger children.</p><p/><p>&quot;Hypoglycemia unawareness&quot; is a condition characterized by a lack of warning symptoms of hypoglycemia because of blunting of the autonomic epinephrine response (see <a href=\"#H1570477263\" class=\"local\">'Definition and pathophysiology'</a> above). This is more commonly seen in children with long duration of diabetes and increases the risk of severe <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> recurrent hypoglycemia. Any episode of hypoglycemia can lower the glucose threshold at which adrenergic discharge and symptoms occur, increasing the risk for subsequent severe hypoglycemia. Prevention of hypoglycemia for a few weeks can restore hypoglycemia awareness. </p><p>In children, nocturnal hypoglycemia is common, with reported incidences on any given night of up to 47 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/7,8\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,8</a>]. Symptoms can be subtle and include nightmares, restless sleep, and upon awakening, headache, confusion, or behavior changes. Decreased release of counterregulatory hormones during sleep may contribute to nocturnal hypoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1570474896\"><span class=\"h1\">CLASSIFICATION OF SEVERITY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The severity of hypoglycemia is classified by symptoms and the response needed for successful treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/1,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,10</a>]. Although these symptom patterns are common, children and their parents show poor ability to detect either high or low blood glucose levels based on symptoms alone. Therefore, regular and confirmatory blood glucose monitoring is important. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of type 1 diabetes mellitus in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Blood glucose monitoring'</a> and <a href=\"#H1570474938\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mild symptoms &ndash; Mild symptoms of hypoglycemia include adrenergic and mild neuroglycopenic manifestations (ie, headaches and behavior changes). Older children can recognize these symptoms and, without the assistance of a second person, can adequately treat themselves with oral intake of a rapidly absorbed carbohydrate. However, infants and very young children are unable to communicate symptoms of hypoglycemia to caregivers, and may not have the same adrenergic signs as older children. Thus, caregivers need to be trained to recognize and treat nonspecific symptoms associated with hypoglycemia in this age group. These symptoms include poor feeding, lethargy, jitteriness, and hypotonia. These symptoms may appear over a range of blood glucose concentrations.

Aiming for very tight glycemic control can further increase the risk of hypoglycemia in this age group. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of type 1 diabetes mellitus in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Age-based care'</a>.)</p><p>In a large multicenter registry, severe hypoglycemia occurred in 9.6 percent of children 2 to &lt;6 years of age, as compared with 5.2 percent of those 6 to &lt;13 years, and 6.3 percent of those 13 to &lt;18 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. In a second observational study, the incidence of severe hypoglycemia decreased with age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In girls &lt;7 years of age, 7 to 12 years of age, and &ge;13 years of age, the frequency of hypoglycemia was 24, 19, and 14 episodes per 100 patient years, respectively. Frequent recurrences of hypoglycemia occurred in a minority of patients, with 20 percent of patients accounting for 80 percent of episodes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1570474914\"><span class=\"h2\">Targets for glycemic control</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the past, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) set higher targets for glycated hemoglobin (A1C) for young children as compared with adolescents and adults because of concerns that more stringent targets might increase the risk for hypoglycemic episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. However, clinical experience with modern management methods suggest that more stringent A1C targets improve glycemic control without significantly increasing the risk for severe hypoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. Therefore, the ADA and International Society for Pediatric and Adolescent Diabetes (ISPAD) now recommend a general target A1C of &lt;7.5 percent for all pediatric age groups, while also recognizing that targets should be tailored to the individual patient.

In general, intensive insulin therapy has the advantage of improved glycemic control, and probably also reduces the risk for hypoglycemia when appropriately administered. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents#H11299132\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of type 1 diabetes mellitus in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Value of an intensive regimen'</a>.) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Conventional regimens</strong> &ndash; Conventional insulin regimens used a fixed daily injection schedule using intermediate-, rapid-, and short-acting insulins. The incidence of hypoglycemia in children treated with a conventional regimen ranges between 20 and 60 episodes per 100 patient years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/12,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,16,17</a>]. Certain characteristics of the insulin regimen are associated with hypoglycemia risk: </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Patients using a fixed conventional insulin regimen are at risk for hypoglycemic events because the regimen includes an intermediate-acting insulin such as neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin, which peaks several hours after administration. Hypoglycemia can occur if adequate glucose is not available at the time of peak insulin effect. As an example, if NPH is given at dinner or bedtime, nocturnal hypoglycemia may occur between 12 AM to 4 AM, when NPH effect peaks (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61880\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61880 \">table 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F59453\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59453 \">figure 1</a>). The risk is increased at night because sleep impairs the counterregulatory hormone responses to hypoglycemia. Similarly, a missed morning snack or delayed lunch may result in hypoglycemia as a consequence of the morning NPH insulin reaching its peak without concomitant food intake. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Snacks between meals and bedtime snacks containing complex carbohydrates (with fat to delay absorption) reduce the frequency and severity of hypoglycemic episodes in children receiving conventional insulin regimens.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Intensive regimens</strong> &ndash; In general, an insulin replacement regimen that delivers a basal insulin dose with intermittent boluses to cover food intake is associated with a lower risk of hypoglycemia than the conventional insulin regimens described above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/18-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-27</a>]. The risk for hypoglycemia has been examined for specific types of intensive insulin therapies:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Multiple daily injections &ndash; Intensive insulin therapy can be delivered by multiple daily injections (MDI). Most regimens use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=insulin-glargine-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">insulin glargine</a>, a long-acting insulin analog, to deliver insulin at a consistent basal rate without a peak effect (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F61880\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef61880 \">table 2</a>). Boluses of a rapid-acting insulin such as lispro or aspart are given before meals and snacks. Observational studies have shown that this approach reduces the incidence of severe hypoglycemic episodes in all age groups, including children &lt;6 years of age as compared with conventional fixed insulin regimens. These data are discussed in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-type-1-diabetes-mellitus-in-children-and-adolescents#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of type 1 diabetes mellitus in children and adolescents&quot;, section on 'Multiple daily injections'</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Insulin pump &ndash; Insulin pump therapy is an alternate form of intensive insulin therapy, in which the insulin pump provides a continuous subcutaneous infusion of insulin delivered at a basal rate with boluses administered with meals and snacks. Controlled trials of insulin pump therapy in this age group generally suggest that it is similar to or somewhat better than MDI in achieving glycemic control and avoiding hypoglycemic episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>]. These data are discussed separately.

This is a consequence of a &quot;stacking effect&quot; because another bolus of insulin is administered before the effect of a previous bolus has cleared. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Continuous glucose monitoring &ndash; Devices (glucose sensors) that continuously monitor blood glucose have been used to enhance insulin dosing for patients using an insulin pump; this is known as sensor-augmented pump therapy. Preliminary trials suggest that this approach may reduce the risk of hypoglycemia compared with standard insulin pump therapy. The use of real time sensor glucose values for insulin adjustments has now been demonstrated to be safe in adolescents with poorly controlled T1DM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].

This is referred to as the overnight predictive low-glucose suspend (PLGS) system. In studies in which the system was programmed to suspend insulin delivery at a threshold glucose of &le;70 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> or when the algorithm predicted a decrease in glucose levels to &lt;80 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> in the next 30 minutes, the PLGS system was effective in reducing nocturnal hypoglycemia by 50 to 54 percent in children 4 to 14 years old, and by 80 percent in individuals 15 to 45 years old [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. Insulin was suspended for up to 120 minutes at a time and up to 180 minutes overnight.

Hyperglycemia can also occur during acute illnesses because of peripheral insulin resistance. Frequent blood glucose monitoring is mandatory for insulin dose adjustment based upon the blood glucose measurements. In many cases, the insulin dose may need to be reduced, but it should never be omitted entirely because hyperglycemia and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) can develop if basal insulin is not given.

Children who are on a fixed conventional insulin regimen are particularly vulnerable if the schedule and carbohydrate content of meals are not consistent because insulin doses will not match glycemic needs.

These simple carbohydrates rapidly raise blood glucose concentration. </p><p>The simple carbohydrates should be followed by consumption of a snack that contains a mixed food source in order to sustain blood glucose levels, such as a peanut butter sandwich, or a bagel with cheese or other fat and protein. Blood glucose should be checked again in 15 to 20 minutes to confirm that glucose values have normalized and to determine whether further intervention is necessary.

One hypothesis is that these effects are caused by severe or repeated episodes of hypoglycemia, which may have deleterious effects on brain development and learning, particularly in young children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/47-50\" class=\"abstract_t\">47-50</a>]. Therefore, avoidance of these episodes remains an important goal of diabetes management, especially in young children. However, current studies provide some reassurance that moderate episodes of hypoglycemia may not be associated with long-term cognitive sequelae in adolescents and adults using modern methods of diabetes management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/10,51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,51,52</a>]. As an example, in a large group of adults and adolescents enrolled in the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT), neither tight glucose control (intensive therapy) nor recurrent severe hypoglycemia were associated with cognitive deficits after an average of 6.5 years of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Long-term follow-up of the DCCT cohort after 18 years of therapy still revealed no association between cognitive function and frequency of episodes of hypoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>].</p><p>On the other hand, severe hypoglycemia clearly has short-term effects on cognitive function. Single acute episodes of hypoglycemia can transiently reduce mental efficiency, including attention and memory [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/55,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,56</a>], alter findings on the electroencephalogram, and increase regional cerebral blood flow [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].

Stroke-like hemiparesis can occur and persist for up to 24 hours after a severe episode. Hypoglycemia can affect critical activities, such as driving or performance in standardized school examinations and reduce efficiency on mathematical tasks, even in patients with mild hypoglycemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/60,61\" class=\"abstract_t\">60,61</a>].

Moreover, prolonged severe hypoglycemia is responsible for 5 to 10 percent of deaths in patients with T1DM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p>Thus, although early onset of T1DM may be associated with an increased risk for neuropsychological dysfunction and structural changes in the brain, it is not clear that these effects are mediated by chronic or acute severe episodes of hypoglycemia. Indeed, some studies suggest that chronic <strong>hyper</strong>glycemia may be responsible for cognitive dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/14,49,62,63\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,49,62,63</a>]; children with a history of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) have been reported to have lower rates of accurate memory on structured tasks than those without a history of DKA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/hypoglycemia-in-children-and-adolescents-with-type-1-diabetes-mellitus/abstract/64,65\" class=\"abstract_t\">64,65</a>].
