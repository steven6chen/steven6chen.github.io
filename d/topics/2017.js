Although the overall incidence is low (about one in 10,000 to 20,000 live births [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-atresia/abstract/2-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-7</a>]), BA is the most common cause of neonatal jaundice for which surgery is indicated and the most common indication for liver transplantation in children. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2535778\"><span class=\"h1\">TYPES OF BILIARY ATRESIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infants with BA can be grouped into three categories:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Biliary atresia without any other anomalies or malformations</strong> &ndash; This pattern is sometimes referred to as perinatal BA, and occurs in 70 to 85 percent of infants with BA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-atresia/abstract/1,8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,8,9</a>]. Typically, these children are born without jaundice, but within the first two months of life, jaundice develops and stools become progressively acholic. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Biliary atresia in association with laterality malformations</strong> &ndash; This pattern is also known as Biliary Atresia Splenic Malformation (BASM) or &quot;embryonal&quot; biliary atresia, and occurs 10 to 15 percent of infants with BA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-atresia/abstract/8-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8-11</a>]. The laterality malformations include situs inversus, asplenia or polysplenia, malrotation, interrupted inferior vena cava, and cardiac anomalies. Data suggest that children with BASM have poorer outcomes compared with those with perinatal BA, possibly due to the associated cardiac abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-atresia/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heterotaxy-isomerism-of-the-atrial-appendages-anatomy-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H309393917\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Heterotaxy (isomerism of the atrial appendages): Anatomy, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Liver'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Biliary atresia in association with other congenital malformations</strong> &ndash; This occurs in the remaining 5 to 10 percent of BA cases; associated congenital malformations include intestinal atresia, imperforate anus, kidney anomalies, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> heart malformations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-atresia/abstract/9,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,13,14</a>]. </p><p/><p>Regardless of the type of BA, in each case, the histology and cholangiogram are characteristic: the histology typically shows inflammation, portal tract fibrosis, cholestasis, and bile duct proliferation; the cholangiogram demonstrates loss of patency of the extrahepatic bile ducts. </p><p>Because of the cholangiographic findings, BA was previously termed &quot;extrahepatic biliary atresia,&quot; to distinguish it from &quot;intrahepatic biliary atresia,&quot; which was a histopathologic grouping of disorders in which the intrahepatic bile ducts are primarily affected. However, disorders primarily affecting the intrahepatic bile ducts are now categorized by the genetic, metabolic or infectious cause, rather than by the histologic finding. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-cholestasis-in-neonates-and-young-infants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of cholestasis in neonates and young infants&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19842386\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cause of BA is unknown, although several mechanisms have been implicated, as outlined below. In some patients, several of these mechanisms may contribute to the development of BA. Conversely, BA may be the common phenotype that can be caused by a variety of injuries to the biliary system occurring in the perinatal period. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19842393\"><span class=\"h2\">Viral etiologies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Clustering of cases of BA in time and space suggest a possible viral etiology. As an example, an analysis of 249 cases of BA over a 16-year period in New York State demonstrated seasonal patterns of incidence that varied by region in the state; in New York City, the risk of BA was highest for infants born during the Spring months, whereas outside of New York City infants born in the Fall months had a higher risk [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-atresia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. To date, a specific virus has not been implicated; investigations have failed to identify associations with several specific viral infections including cytomegalovirus, reovirus, and group C rotavirus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-atresia/abstract/16-19\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-19</a>]. However, one study reported that infants positive for cytomegalovirus (CMV) immunoglobulin M (IgM) have reduced clearance of jaundice following Kasai hepatoportoenterostomy (HPE), suggesting that such infants are a distinct prognostic subgroup [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-atresia/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19842400\"><span class=\"h2\">Toxic etiologies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clustering of cases of BA is also consistent with the possibility of a toxin-mediated inflammatory response. The strongest evidence for this hypothesis comes from three reported outbreaks of BA in lambs in Australia in 1964, 1988, and 2007 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-atresia/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. In each outbreak, in a time of drought ewes that gave birth to affected lambs had grazed on lands that had previously been flooded. A significant number of offspring were thin, jaundiced, had acholic stools, and eventually died, and autopsy revealed a diagnosis of BA. The hypothesized mechanism is that the pregnant ewes ingested a toxin when grazing on lands previously submerged. A novel isoflavonoid toxin was isolated from the Dysphania plant, which was harvested in Australia at the site of a recent outbreak. This toxin caused severe damage to the extrahepatic biliary tree in a zebrafish model, and also loss of cilia in neonatal mouse cholangiocytes. This evidence suggests that an environmental toxin may be implicated in some cases of BA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-atresia/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19842407\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic etiologies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Genetic factors may play a causative role in the small subgroup of patients with BASM malformations, as suggested by the following observations: </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Mutations in the <em>CFC1</em> gene, which encodes cryptic protein and is involved in determining laterality during fetal development, have been associated with BASM syndrome. A heterozygous mutation in <em>CFC1</em> was found in five out of ten infants with BASM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-atresia/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. The frequency of this mutation in infants with BASM is twice that found in a population of healthy individuals. Thus, <em>CFC1</em> mutations may predispose to BASM but are not sufficient to cause the disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A transgenic mouse with a recessive deletion of the inversin gene provides an animal model for BASM, displaying situs inversus and extrahepatic biliary obstruction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-atresia/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A heterozygous deletion of <em>FOXA2</em> has been reported in a family with heterotaxy, panhypopituitarism, and biliary atresia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-atresia/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>With advances in next-generation sequencing technology, additional candidate genes may be identified in this patient population.</p><p/><p>Other than these subgroups of patients with BASM, genetic factors may not play a direct causative role in the development of most cases of BA; this is suggested by the observation that monozygotic twins usually have a discordant phenotype. Nonetheless, genetics may still play a role in disease susceptibility. Association studies have identified a few genomic loci with increased susceptibility to BA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-atresia/abstract/26-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">26-28</a>]. In addition, mutations in the human Jagged1 gene, which are responsible for Alagille syndrome, have been found in a few cases of biliary atresia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-atresia/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. The Jagged1 gene encodes a ligand in the Notch signaling pathway, which is critical in the determination of cell fate during development and may also alter production of inflammatory cytokines. Epigenetic factors have also been postulated as important factors impacting biliary development and the pathogenesis of BA. Both microRNA and DNA methylation have been studied in animal models and humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-atresia/abstract/30,31\" class=\"abstract_t\">30,31</a>].

In a study from Japan that included more than 300,000 newborn infants, stool color cards completed by the parents had a sensitivity of 76.5 percent and specificity of 99.9 percent, respectively, for identifying infants with biliary atresia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-atresia/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most infants have dark urine because of bilirubin excretion into the urine. This often is not recognized by parents, who may not realize that infant urine should not stain a diaper yellow. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the jaundice has gone unnoticed and the child's disease has progressed, there may be a firm, enlarged liver and splenomegaly. </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9952381\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory studies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When laboratory studies are performed in infants after they come to attention because of one of the above symptoms, they reveal elevations in direct <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> conjugated bilirubin and mild or moderate elevations in serum aminotransferases, with a disproportionately increased GGTP. If coagulopathy is present at diagnosis, it is most likely due to vitamin K deficiency. </p><p>If laboratory studies are performed shortly after birth (before the infant becomes symptomatic), mild elevations of conjugated bilirubin are seen. As an example, one study reported mild elevations in conjugated bilirubin (&gt;0.3 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> or direct bilirubin (&gt;0.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL)</span> at 24 to 48 hours of life in each of 34 infants who were later diagnosed with BA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-atresia/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. The mean serum direct bilirubin level was 1.4 &plusmn; 0.43 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL,</span> as compared with 0.19 &plusmn; 0.075 in control infants. The total bilirubin was not elevated at that time and conjugated bilirubin did not exceed 20 percent of the total bilirubin level. </p><p>These observations suggest that infants with mildly elevated conjugated or direct bilirubin levels in the perinatal period should be followed closely and evaluated for the possibility of BA. Furthermore, they raise the possibility that measurements of conjugated or direct bilirubin during the first few days of life could be used as a screening tool for BA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-atresia/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. In a pilot study of such an approach, 11,636 infants were screened for persistent elevations in conjugated or direct bilirubin during the birth hospitalization, resulting in early identification of two infants with biliary atresia, and one with alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-atresia/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. Further studies are needed to determine the sensitivity and cost-effectiveness of this measure and its potential effect on patient outcome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19842428\"><span class=\"h1\">EVALUATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infants with suspected BA should be evaluated as rapidly as possible because the success of the surgical intervention (hepatoportoenterostomy, the Kasai procedure) diminishes progressively with older age at surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-atresia/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H7032591\" class=\"local\">'Predictors of the need for transplantation'</a> below.)</p><p>The evaluation process involves a series of serologic, laboratory, urine, and imaging tests. The order of diagnostic tests is prioritized based on testing for treatable diseases first, such as biliary obstruction, infections, and some metabolic diseases. Because the timing of surgery is crucial for infants with BA, the evaluation should be completed as quickly as possible, and it is sometimes appropriate to proceed with surgical exploration, even if all of the test results have not returned. In our practice, we typically proceed with each of the steps below if the infant is less than six weeks of age. For those patients six weeks and older, we still try to complete a full evaluation as rapidly as possible (eg, three to four days). Our rationale is that some diseases, such as Alagille Syndrome or alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency, can mimic many of the findings of BA. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4120617139\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory testing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evaluation of a young infant with cholestasis includes blood tests to assess hepatic function and rule out metabolic disease and other etiologies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F111409\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef111409 \">table 1</a>). Further detail about the laboratory evaluation of an infant with cholestasis is given in a separate topic review. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-evaluation-of-cholestasis-in-neonates-and-young-infants#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to evaluation of cholestasis in neonates and young infants&quot;, section on 'Laboratory studies'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19845734\"><span class=\"h2\">Abdominal ultrasound</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Evaluation of biliary anatomy begins with an ultrasound. The main utility of the ultrasound is to exclude other anatomic causes of cholestasis (ie, choledochal cyst) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-cholestasis-in-neonates-and-young-infants#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of cholestasis in neonates and young infants&quot;, section on 'Biliary cysts'</a>). In infants with BA, the gallbladder is usually either absent or irregular in shape. When a detailed ultrasonographic protocol is used, additional features can be identified to support the diagnosis of biliary atresia, including abnormal gallbladder size and shape, the &quot;triangular cord&quot; sign, gallbladder contractility, and absence of the common bile duct [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-atresia/abstract/42-46\" class=\"abstract_t\">42-46</a>]. The triangular cord sign is a triangular echogenic density seen just above the porta hepatis on US scan. Its presence is highly suggestive of biliary atresia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-atresia/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19845741\"><span class=\"h2\">Hepatobiliary scintigraphy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patency of the extrahepatic biliary tree can be further assessed by hepatobiliary scintigraphy. Although some centers may use <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenobarbital-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">phenobarbital</a> to enhance radioisotope excretion, we do not use phenobarbital because it will delay diagnosis and does not obviate the need for liver biopsy. Failure of tracer excretion suggests BA, but does not exclude other diseases. If there is strong suspicion for BA, such as in a patient with acholic stools, excretion of tracer is unlikely to occur and it is acceptable to proceed directly to liver biopsy.</p><p>Conversely, if scintigraphy demonstrates definite excretion of the tracer from the liver to the small bowel, patency is established, and BA is very unlikely. In this case, an intraoperative cholangiogram is not necessary. However, if excretion is noted on a scan that is performed when the infant is very young (ie, less than six weeks old), and cholestasis persists, the scan should be repeated one to two weeks later because the disease process may progress during the neonatal period. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19845787\"><span class=\"h2\">Liver biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We perform a liver biopsy in virtually all infants with suspected biliary atresia for two reasons. One purpose is to identify histologic changes consistent with obstruction that warrant surgical exploration. The other is to differentiate BA from other causes of intrahepatic cholestasis, which would not need surgical exploration. </p><p>Biopsy findings that indicate another etiology include bile duct paucity (Alagille syndrome), PAS positive diastase resistant granules (consistent with alpha-one antitrypsin deficiency), loss of MDR3 staining (suggestive of PFIC3), or giant cell hepatitis without proliferation of ducts. Characteristic histologic features of BA include expanded portal tracts with bile duct proliferation, portal tract edema, fibrosis and inflammation, and canalicular and bile duct bile plugs. The earliest histological changes associated with BA may be relatively nonspecific, and biopsies done too early may result in a false negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-atresia/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. At times it is necessary to repeat a liver biopsy at an older age (eg, two to three weeks later). </p><p>Histologic findings alone cannot help to distinguish BA from other causes of obstruction, such as choledochal cyst or external compression. Therefore, any evidence of obstruction mandates imaging studies (ie, ultrasonography, if not already done), and a definitive cholangiogram. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15007525\"><span class=\"h2\">Cholangiogram</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the above steps in the evaluation support the diagnosis of BA, the infant should be taken to the operating room. The first step is an intraoperative cholangiogram, which is the gold standard in the diagnosis of BA. It is essential that patency be investigated both proximally into the liver and distally into the bowel to determine whether BA is present. If the intraoperative cholangiogram demonstrates biliary obstruction (ie, if the contrast does not fill the biliary tree or reach the intestine), the surgeon should perform a hepatoportoenterostomy (Kasai HPE) at that time. In some cases, the cholangiogram cannot be performed because the gallbladder and biliary tree are atretic; in this case the surgeon makes the diagnostic decision based on visual inspection of the biliary tree.</p><p>An alternative yet valid approach used at some centers is to perform a percutaneous gallbladder cholangiogram or an ERCP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-atresia/abstract/49-51\" class=\"abstract_t\">49-51</a>]. These procedures are less invasive than intraoperative cholangiogram, but performance of these procedures in infants requires special expertise and equipment. Moreover, if BA is confirmed, the infant will still need to undergo an operation for treatment. The percutaneous gallbladder cholangiogram can only be performed in an infant with an identified gallbladder; the procedure is performed by an interventional radiologist. Alternatively, an endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) can be used to demonstrate biliary patency in an infant. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ercp-for-biliary-disease-in-children#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;ERCP for biliary disease in children&quot;, section on 'Neonatal cholestasis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4133264285\"><span class=\"h1\">DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The possibility of BA is suggested by the clinical presentation of neonatal conjugated hyperbilirubinemia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> acholic stools. The suspicion of BA is strengthened by results of a variety of tests (typically ultrasound, hepatobiliary scan, and liver biopsy). The definitive diagnosis is made by intraoperative cholangiogram. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1043802001\"><span class=\"h2\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In term infants, biliary atresia and neonatal hepatitis account for a majority of cases of neonatal cholestasis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F79511\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef79511 \">table 2</a>). A variety of genetic disorders account for most of the remainder. In premature infants, cholestasis more often results from <a href=\"topic.htm?path=total-parenteral-nutrition-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">total parenteral nutrition</a> (TPN) or sepsis. The range of causes and an approach to distinguishing among them are discussed separately.

This operation is undertaken in the attempt to restore bile flow from the liver to the proximal small bowel (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F67547\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67547 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-atresia/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>]. For this procedure, a roux-en-Y loop of bowel is created by the surgeon and directly anastomosed to the hilum of the liver, following excision of the biliary remnant and portal fibrous plate. &#160;</p><p>If the HPE is successful, the remaining small patent bile ducts will drain into the roux limb and jaundice will start to resolve in the weeks following surgery. Even if bile flow is established and cholestasis improves, many patients will have slowly progressive liver disease despite undergoing the Kasai HPE procedure, and the majority of patients with BA will ultimately require liver transplantation. At least 50 percent of patients who undergo HPE will require liver transplantation by two years of age as a result of primary failure of the HPE <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> growth failure. The patient's age at the time of HPE can predict native liver survival at later time points. As an example, among those patients who undergo HPE &le;30 days of life, the chance of native liver survival at four years of age is nearly 50 percent, whereas among those who underwent HPE between 31 and 90 days of life, the chance of native liver survival at four years of age is 36 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-atresia/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H19844244\" class=\"local\">'Prognosis'</a> below.)</p><p>If the HPE is unsuccessful, bile drainage is not achieved, and the child remains jaundiced. If there is persistent jaundice or elevated serum bilirubin three months after the procedure, the patient should be referred for liver transplant evaluation. (See <a href=\"#H19844768\" class=\"local\">'Liver transplantation'</a> below and <a href=\"#H7032591\" class=\"local\">'Predictors of the need for transplantation'</a> below.)</p><p>Revision of a non-functioning HPE generally is not recommended. This is because a revisional procedure is unlikely to be effective if the original HPE did not achieve bile drainage, and because the revisional procedure is likely to cause adhesions that increase the technical difficulty of a subsequent transplant procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-atresia/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. However, in patients in whom the initial HPE was successful, revisional HPE may be appropriate if the patient abruptly develops jaundice, or experiences recurrent episodes of cholangitis but has no other evidence of chronic liver disease. In one report of 24 patients who underwent revisional HPE for these indications, 75 percent achieved bile drainage and 46 percent survived with their native liver (mean follow-up 92 months) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-atresia/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. </p><p>Thus, the vast majority of individuals with BA will eventually require liver transplantation. Nonetheless, the Kasai HPE obviates the need for liver transplantation in a substantial minority and significantly delays the liver transplantation for many others. If bile drainage is achieved, it is likely that transplantation will not be needed for years or decades. Patients who undergo HPE have survival rates with native liver of 35 to 50 percent at four years of age; this compares favorably with historical series from before the Kasai procedure was introduced in 1968, which reported a 10 percent survival rate at age three years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-atresia/abstract/56,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">56,57</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H19844768\" class=\"local\">'Liver transplantation'</a> below.)</p><p>Pre-emptive transplant (ie, transplant without prior HPE) is avoided because of the&nbsp;advantages of transplanting older, larger patients and because of the potential for improved transplantation therapies in the future. At one time pre-emptive transplantation was used to avoid the difficulties of performing surgery on a patient with a prior HPE. With modern transplantation techniques, there is no surgical advantage to pre-emptive transplantation.

This is standard practice in BA, although its clinical utility has not been definitively established. UDCA is a hydrophilic bile acid; when given by mouth it shifts the balance of bile acids towards hydrophilic forms. This is thought to stabilize membranes and the reduce generation of free radicals, thus protecting mitochondria from damage. </p><p>The recommended dose of UDCA in BA ranges from 15 to 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day,</span> and should not exceed 30 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg/day</span>.

In several large randomized double blind placebo-controlled trials in patients with PBC, UDCA decreased plasma levels of aminotransferases, improved liver histology and quality of life, and decreased risk of death and need for liver transplantation (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=trials-of-ursodeoxycholic-acid-for-the-treatment-of-primary-biliary-cholangitis-primary-biliary-cirrhosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Trials of ursodeoxycholic acid for the treatment of primary biliary cholangitis (primary biliary cirrhosis)&quot;</a>).

Because of malabsorption and metabolic alterations, the total caloric needs in infants with BA are approximately 150 percent of the recommended energy intake for healthy infants and children (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=failure-to-thrive-undernutrition-in-children-younger-than-two-years-management#H444759485\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Failure to thrive (undernutrition) in children younger than two years: Management&quot;, section on 'Energy requirements for catch-up growth'</a>).

These strategies are similar to those used for infants with other causes of growth failure, except that they should be implemented proactively because of the high rates of growth failure in patients with BA. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=failure-to-thrive-undernutrition-in-children-younger-than-two-years-management#H444759485\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Failure to thrive (undernutrition) in children younger than two years: Management&quot;, section on 'Energy requirements for catch-up growth'</a>.) </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For infants, formulas are concentrated or expressed breast milk is fortified to provide additional energy. After Kasai HPE, the feed is typically designed to provide 24 kcal per ounce.

Gastrostomy tubes are not recommended because many patients develop portal hypertension, leading to gastric varices and the propensity to develop varices around the gastrostomy tube site. Candidates for nasogastric feeds are identified by poor weight gain <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> poor linear growth. Proactive management is recommended because the malnutrition may worsen the overall prognosis, with or without liver transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-atresia/abstract/62\" class=\"abstract_t\">62</a>].

Once jaundice resolves and vitamins are replete, children can be transitioned to standard multivitamins. Nevertheless, routine monitoring of vitamin levels should continue (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51569\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51569 \">table 3</a>). </p><p>Deficiencies of fat-soluble vitamins are common in patients with BA. In a series of 29 patients with BA, serologic deficiencies of vitamins A and E and radiographic evidence of vitamin D deficiency were reported despite establishment of bile flow by hepatoportoenterostomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-atresia/abstract/67\" class=\"abstract_t\">67</a>]. Vitamin deficiencies occur despite recommended supplementation and are particularly common among patients with residual cholestasis after Kasai HPE (defined in this study as serum total bilirubin &ge;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [34 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L])</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-atresia/abstract/68\" class=\"abstract_t\">68</a>].

Therefore, vitamin levels should be monitored frequently (ie, several times in the first year), starting at the first month after HPE, in order to adjust supplements appropriately for deficiencies or toxicities (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51569\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51569 \">table 3</a>). </p><p>Infants with biliary atresia and prolonged jaundice may be deficient in vitamin K.

The incidence of cholangitis in these patients is between 40 and 90 percent, with the majority of patients experiencing at least one episode prior to two years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-atresia/abstract/57,70\" class=\"abstract_t\">57,70</a>]. These patients are at risk for cholangitis because of the abnormal anatomy and bacterial stasis in the region of the roux limb. Clinicians should have a high level of suspicion for cholangitis in children presenting with fever without a clear source of infection, especially if the fever is accompanied by acholic stools, irritability, and laboratory abnormalities. By contrast, patients with an unsuccessful Kasai (ie, in which bile drainage is not achieved) have a low risk for ascending cholangitis but are still at risk for other infections and sepsis.</p><p>Because cholangitis can be life threatening and may impact long- and short-term outcomes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-atresia/abstract/70,71\" class=\"abstract_t\">70,71</a>], most clinicians prescribe prophylactic antibiotics in the first year of life. Small nonrandomized trials suggest that the benefits of antibiotic prophylaxis outweigh the risks of antibiotic resistance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-atresia/abstract/72,73\" class=\"abstract_t\">72,73</a>]. As an example, in one series infants treated with prophylactic antibiotics had half the rate of cholangitis as compared with infants in a historical control group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-atresia/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>].

There may be evidence to suggest that treatment with probiotics can afford a similar prophylactic effect as antibiotics, but further studies are needed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-atresia/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].</p><p>Recurrent cholangitis may predict the need for liver transplantation as it can lead to progressive cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-atresia/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>]; however, one episode of cholangitis does not predict early transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-atresia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19844713\"><span class=\"h3\">Portal hypertension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The chronic hepatobiliary inflammation characteristic of BA leads to progressive biliary cirrhosis. Biliary cirrhosis causes portal hypertension, which can lead to variceal bleeding and ascites. Development of splenomegaly or declining platelet counts after Kasai HPE suggest the possibility of evolving portal hypertension.</p><p>In a registry study of 163 children with BA in North America who had not undergone liver transplantation (average age 9.2 years), half had definite portal hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-atresia/abstract/75\" class=\"abstract_t\">75</a>]. Among those with portal hypertension, 53 percent had a history of variceal bleeding, 17 percent had ascites, and 34 percent had reduced hepatic synthetic function (PT &gt;15 seconds or albumin &lt;3 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL)</span>. Recurrent variceal bleeding and refractory ascites are indications for liver transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-atresia/abstract/76,77\" class=\"abstract_t\">76,77</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H19844768\" class=\"local\">'Liver transplantation'</a> below.) &#160;</p><p>If portal hypertension leads to variceal bleeding, this complication is often controlled with sclerotherapy or banding. After the first variceal bleed, sclerotherapy or band ligation is instituted on a repeat basis with the ultimate goal of complete variceal obliteration. Some centers perform surveillance endoscopy to gauge the size and status of developing varices in patients who demonstrate clinical and ultrasonographic signs of portal hypertension following the Kasai procedure. In a series of 47 children with BA managed with endoscopic surveillance, varices developed in about half of the children, at a mean of 19 months (range 4 to 165 months) after successful Kasai HPE [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-atresia/abstract/78\" class=\"abstract_t\">78</a>]. Other centers begin routine surveillance endoscopies only after the patient has experienced the first variceal bleed. A consensus statement on the management of portal hypertension in children suggests that primary prophylaxis of esophageal varices is not indicated except in extenuating circumstances, such as when the child is not in reasonable proximity to emergency care [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-atresia/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. </p><p>If ascites develops and is severe enough to compromise respiratory function, it is usually treated with paracentesis followed by chronic administration of diuretics, beta-blockers, salt <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> water dietary restriction, or a combination of these interventions. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19844768\"><span class=\"h1\">LIVER TRANSPLANTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of individuals with BA eventually require liver transplantation; indeed BA is the most common indication for liver transplantation in infants and children.

Because the outcomes of liver transplantation improve for infants with weights &gt;10 kg, as compared to smaller infants, transplantation of infants with persistent cholestasis may be postponed if growth can be achieved and the infants are otherwise stable. Supplemental nasogastric tube feedings are often necessary to attain adequate growth. The cholestasis may cause chronic pruritus, which often responds to medical therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pruritus-associated-with-cholestasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pruritus associated with cholestasis&quot;</a>.) </p><p>For those children who require liver transplantation, prognosis is generally good. In the United States, the one-year patient- and liver-graft survival rates for pediatric patients undergoing primary liver transplant for BA are 92.1 and 83.6 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-atresia/abstract/81\" class=\"abstract_t\">81</a>]. In international series, long-term survival is approximately 70 to 80 percent at both 5 and 10 years, and these rates continue to improve in more recent case series<strong> </strong>[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-atresia/abstract/53,83-86\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,83-86</a>]. </p><p>BA patients can receive whole or segmental deceased donor grafts, as well as segments from a living donor. The liver transplant surgery in BA patients is complicated by presence of intra-abdominal adhesions attributed to previous HPE. Postoperative outcomes appear to be less favorable in the subset of BA patients with BASM, due to the enhanced difficulty associated with liver dissection and vascular reconstruction in these patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-atresia/abstract/85\" class=\"abstract_t\">85</a>]. Poor nutrition is associated with increased mortality either while awaiting transplantation or after the procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-atresia/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>]. Thus, vigorous nutritional support, including nasogastric feeds, is essential in the pre- and postoperative care of these patients.

Twenty-one percent of the long-term survivors had normal liver biochemical tests and no evidence of cirrhosis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Among 34 patients with BA who underwent Kasai HPE between 1994 and 2011, survival with the native liver was 87.6 percent at 5 years, 76.9 percent at 10 years, and 48.5 percent at 15 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-atresia/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. This represents substantial improvement in outcomes compared with earlier series, possibly due to earlier identification of affected infants due to a national screening program using stool color cards. (See <a href=\"#H9952373\" class=\"local\">'Signs and symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p>In addition to complications from portal hypertension and late-onset cholangitis, the risk of developing cancer in the native liver remains an important concern. Careful monitoring and treatment of these late complications is essential. Pregnancy in female survivors of BA is not without risk, and the pregnancy must be monitored to ensure the health and safety of the mother and child. </p><p>Given the improvements in early identification of infants with BA, and advances in medical therapy after Kasai HPE, including prophylaxis against cholangitis and improvements in nutrition and bile flow, it is reasonable to expect that long-term survival from current cases will exceed that of these older series. Experimental areas of therapy such as anti-fibrotic or antiinflammatory agents may improve outcomes in the future.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7032591\"><span class=\"h2\">Predictors of the need for transplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Although performance of the Kasai HPE clearly improves survival overall, the long-term prognosis is difficult to predict. The three most important prognostic factors for surgical outcome are younger age at the time of HPE, the expertise of the surgeon and care center at which the procedure is performed, and the decrease in serum bilirubin in the first few months after HPE. </p><p>Many case series have documented better outcomes when HPE is performed before 60 days of age and poorer outcomes after 90 days of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-atresia/abstract/41,83,91,92\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,83,91,92</a>]. As an example, in a series of 349 infants diagnosed and treated for biliary atresia in Canada, older age at time of HPE was associated with a progressive decrease in patient survival with the native liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-atresia/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. Among infants who underwent HPE at &le;30 days, 31 to 90 days, and &ge;90 days, the survival with the native liver at four years of age was 49, 36, and 23 percent, respectively. In Taiwan, after implementation of a protocol using universal screening for infant stool color increased the rate of accomplishing HPE before 60 days of life from 50 to 66 percent, improvements in several clinically important outcomes were seen: the rate of jaundice-free survival with the native liver at three years of age improved from 32 to 57 percent, and the rate of overall survival at five years of age improved from 56 to 89 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-atresia/abstract/98\" class=\"abstract_t\">98</a>]. However, the time at which early is early enough and late is too late is controversial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-atresia/abstract/99\" class=\"abstract_t\">99</a>]. </p><p>Surgical success is dependent on the expertise of the center and surgeon. Although controversial, it appears that a center that performs at least five Kasai procedures per year has a better success rate, as measured by 5- or 10-year long-term survival with the native liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-atresia/abstract/84,91,100\" class=\"abstract_t\">84,91,100</a>]. Another surgical factor is anatomic pattern of biliary atresia identified at time of Kasai hepatoportoenterostomy. Children born without atresia at the porta hepatis (Ohi classification 1) have the lowest risk of death or transplantation by two years of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-atresia/abstract/101\" class=\"abstract_t\">101</a>].</p><p>Among all variables, serum bilirubin post HPE appears to be the most predictive biomarker of outcome. Data suggest that the serum total bilirubin level measured three months after Kasai HPE is predictive of native liver survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-atresia/abstract/8,102\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,102</a>]. In a prospective cohort, among patients with total bilirubin &lt;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> three months post-Kasai HPE, two-year survival without transplantation was 86 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-atresia/abstract/102\" class=\"abstract_t\">102</a>]. Among those with total bilirubin &ge;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> three months post-Kasai HPE, survival without transplantation was only 20 percent. Infants with elevated bilirubin were also more likely to develop poor weight gain, hypoalbuminemia, and coagulopathy. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2597504829\"><span class=\"h1\">SOCIETY GUIDELINE LINKS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Links to society and government-sponsored guidelines from selected countries and regions around the world are provided separately.

Those with laterality anomalies have a somewhat worse prognosis. (See <a href=\"#H19842378\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The causes of BA are not well established and are probably multifactorial; genetic factors may play a permissive role in some cases, but infectious, toxic, or immunologic mechanisms are probably involved. (See <a href=\"#H19842386\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most infants with BA are born at full term, have a normal birth weight, and initially thrive and seem healthy. Scleral icterus <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> generalized jaundice typically develop by eight weeks of age. Infants may also have acholic (very pale colored) stools (see &quot;<a href=\"http://www.perinatalservicesbc.ca/NR/rdonlyres/B8EF81F6-CAA6-4F7B-90CA-C66079E8A87B/0/StoolColourCard_English.pdf&amp;token=l+NkM5ROVENhG8MFLQI8wRvHFVa6UzDEVEsTyqIi+MgalmuKykO/PgSiWFtN0f/HQpvftsURG7q3bblLXpr0FEr0nN3Qmwj22TccTFXU6iWN+yQZEKVgat8G0W8C+2faDhuNr1j2RusmsEh1WU6yTw==&amp;TOPIC_ID=14369\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">stool color card</a>&quot; for examples), dark urine, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> a firm liver and splenomegaly. Laboratory testing reveals elevation in serum conjugated bilirubin (&gt;2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [34 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L])</span> and mild or moderate elevations in serum aminotransferases with a disproportionately increased GGTP. (See <a href=\"#H19842421\" class=\"local\">'Clinical features'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of BA is made with a series of imaging and laboratory tests and liver biopsy to exclude other causes of cholestasis. Infants should be evaluated as rapidly as possible because the success of the surgical intervention diminishes progressively with older age at surgery. Because timing is crucial, some infants (eg, those who are eight weeks or older or with a high clinical suspicion of BA) may not require each diagnostic step. (See <a href=\"#H19842428\" class=\"local\">'Evaluation'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The definitive diagnosis of BA is made by a cholangiogram. This is typically performed intraoperatively; if the diagnosis of BA is confirmed, the surgeon performs a hepatoportoenterostomy (HPE, also known as a Kasai procedure) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F67547\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67547 \">figure 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H15007525\" class=\"local\">'Cholangiogram'</a> above and <a href=\"#H4133264285\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend that all infants with BA undergo a Kasai HPE (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). This surgery should be performed as soon as the diagnosis of BA can be made and preferably before 60 days of age. This is because younger age at the time of the Kasai HPE is associated with better outcomes (ie, higher likelihood of resolution of cholestasis and longer survival with the native liver). (See <a href=\"#H19843985\" class=\"local\">'Kasai procedure'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7032591\" class=\"local\">'Predictors of the need for transplantation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We suggest that infants and children be treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ursodeoxycholic-acid-ursodiol-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">ursodeoxycholic acid</a> (UDCA) after Kasai HPE (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). We do <strong>not</strong> recommend treatment with glucocorticoids (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). (See <a href=\"#H19844509\" class=\"local\">'Choleretics'</a> above and <a href=\"#H2134435436\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoids (unproven benefit)'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infants with BA who are jaundiced are at risk for fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies and should be treated with supplements of fat-soluble vitamins and monitored for fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F51569\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef51569 \">table 3</a>). In addition, they should be given high calorie formula or other nutritional supplements as required to sustain normal rates of growth. If weight gain is below normal despite these measures, nasogastric feeds should be administered to optimize growth. Vigorous nutritional support is also indicated for non-cholestatic infants with BA. (See <a href=\"#H19844523\" class=\"local\">'Nutrition'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After Kasai HPE infants and children are at risk for ascending cholangitis. Some data have shown that repeated episodes of cholangitis can hasten the progression of liver disease. To reduce this risk, we suggest treating all patients with prophylactic antibiotics in the first year of life (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H19844706\" class=\"local\">'Ascending cholangitis'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>After Kasai HPE, if there is persistent jaundice three months later then the patient should be referred for liver transplant evaluation. Other indications for early liver transplantation include failure to thrive despite vigorous nutritional rehabilitation. (See <a href=\"#H19844768\" class=\"local\">'Liver transplantation'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the current era, at least 60 to 80 percent of patients with BA will eventually require liver transplantation. Indications for liver transplantation include complications of portal hypertension (recurrent variceal bleeding or intractable ascites), growth failure, and progressive liver dysfunction. (See <a href=\"#H19844768\" class=\"local\">'Liver transplantation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A minority of patients with BA treated with Kasai HPE survive to 20 years or more without liver transplantation. However, many of these patients have chronic liver disease with cirrhosis and portal hypertension. (See <a href=\"#H7032584\" class=\"local\">'Survival without transplantation'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/biliary-atresia/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Haber BA, Russo P.
