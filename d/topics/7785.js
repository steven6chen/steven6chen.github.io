This goal proved more challenging than originally foreseen, and important obstacles remain; these obstacles include poor access to children in remaining endemic areas due to insecurity and co-circulation of oral poliovirus vaccine-derived polioviruses (cVDPV). Nonetheless, great progress has been made: the incidence of paralytic polio worldwide has been reduced by more than 1000-fold, two of the three naturally occurring (wild-type) poliovirus serotypes no longer circulate, and type 1 poliovirus disease is now confined to only two countries, Pakistan and Afghanistan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-poliomyelitis-eradication/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The Global Poliomyelitis Eradication Initiative (GPEI) expects to interrupt transmission of all wild-type and cVDPV viruses by 2019, introduce inactivated <a href=\"topic.htm?path=poliovirus-vaccine-inactivated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">poliovirus vaccine</a> (IPV) into the routine infant immunization schedule in all countries, and phase out OPV use in a staged manner to reduce the risk of vaccine-associated paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) and new cVDPV outbreaks following complete interruption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-poliomyelitis-eradication/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>Issues related to polio eradication are reviewed here. Issues related to polio infection and routine polio vaccination are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=polio-and-infectious-diseases-of-the-anterior-horn\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Polio and infectious diseases of the anterior horn&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=poliovirus-vaccination\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Poliovirus vaccination&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17939848\"><span class=\"h1\">GLOBAL ERADICATION PARTNERSHIP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Global Polio Eradication Initiative partnership was launched in 1988 and is led by five organizations: the World Health Organization, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the United Nations Children's Fund, Rotary International, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. The partnership includes many governmental and nongovernmental donors as well as the ministries of health of all affected nations who plan and carry out the program's initiatives, at an overall cost that exceeds $1 billion per year.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17939855\"><span class=\"h1\">ERADICATION STRATEGIES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The global eradication program is based on four strategies: routine infant immunization, supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) in at-risk middle- and low-income countries, surveillance for acute flaccid paralysis (AFP), and mop-up campaigns [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-poliomyelitis-eradication/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Until 2005, trivalent oral polio vaccine (tOPV) was used exclusively for routine immunization and in SIAs due to low cost, ease of administration by non-medical workers, and induction of mucosal immunity that reduces person-to-person and community poliovirus transmission. With the elimination of wild-type 2 poliovirus circulation in 1999, monovalent type 1 and type 3 vaccines (mOPV1 and mOPV3) and bivalent type 1 and 3 (bOPV) vaccine replaced tOPV for many SIAs conducted after 2005 due to superior immunogenicity against poliovirus types 1 and 3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-poliomyelitis-eradication/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Dose for dose, inactivated <a href=\"topic.htm?path=poliovirus-vaccine-inactivated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">poliovirus vaccine</a> (IPV) results in higher seroconversion rates than OPV in low-income settings, where the burden of enteric pathogens and tropical enteropathy reduces the efficacy of OPV [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-poliomyelitis-eradication/abstract/7-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">7-9</a>]. However, IPV costs approximately 10 times more than OPV to produce, requires injection, and induces little or no intestinal immunity than OPV. For these reasons, IPV was not included in the program until 2015, in anticipation of replacing tOPV with bOPV in 2016.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17939862\"><span class=\"h2\">Routine immunization</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Since the 1970s, most low- and middle-income countries have used tOPV in their national childhood immunization programs following the World Health Organization (WHO) Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) recommended schedule that specifies doses at birth and at 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-poliomyelitis-eradication/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Most high-income countries administer IPV in combination with other childhood vaccines, and some (mostly middle-income) countries have deployed a mixed IPV-OPV schedule.</p><p>The WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on immunization recommended introduction of one or more IPV doses into the EPI schedule in advance of the global, synchronized switch from tOPV to bOPV in April 2016 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-poliomyelitis-eradication/abstract/4,6\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,6</a>]. In most low-income countries, one dose of IPV is now given at 14 weeks of age in addition to bOPV at birth and 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age.</p><p>In China, the switch to bOPV and administration of IPV at two months of age in a mixed IPV-OPV schedule resulted in virtual elimination of VAPP [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-poliomyelitis-eradication/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17939869\"><span class=\"h2\">Supplemental immunization activities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Routine tOPV immunization rates in many regions fall well below the threshold required to interrupt poliovirus transmission through herd immunity; therefore, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) relies on SIAs to raise population immunity to polio. SIAs (also known as National Immunization Days and Sub-National Immunization Days) deliver OPV via periodic, highly organized campaigns conducted door to door or at fixed sites within population centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-poliomyelitis-eradication/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Typically, a campaign is conducted over a few days and targets all persons of a specified age range (usually &lt;5 years) without regard to prior OPV immunization history. Since 2005, most SIAs have deployed mOPV and, more recently, bOPV. Until 2015, the GPEI conducted multiple bOPV and tOPV campaigns in 30 countries in Africa and Asia. The use of tOPV was discontinued in April 2016.</p><p>SIA quality is assessed through independent SIA monitoring within each country and by lot quality assurance surveillance (LQAS) protocols developed specifically for this purpose. SIAs are credited with interrupting poliovirus transmission throughout the developing world, and programmatic successes in Africa and Asia are associated with improvements in SIA quality.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17939876\"><span class=\"h2\">Surveillance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surveillance for poliomyelitis cases consists of detection of acute flaccid paralysis cases in children and adolescents &le;15 years of age that are compatible with poliomyelitis. Stool collected from AFP cases and close contacts within 14 days of onset are tested by cell culture in a regional Global Polio Laboratory Network laboratory for the presence of polioviruses and other enteroviruses. Poliovirus isolates are forwarded to reference laboratories for differentiation from oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=poliovirus-vaccine-inactivated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">poliovirus vaccine</a> strains and further characterization. Only a small fraction of AFP cases are confirmed as polio cases by laboratory testing. In addition, the polio immunization status of every AFP case is recorded as an additional measure of population immunity.</p><p>Environmental surveillance for circulating wild-type and vaccine-derived polioviruses by periodic sampling of sewage effluents in high-risk areas supplements AFP surveillance. The value of environmental surveillance was demonstrated in Israel, where wild-type 1 poliovirus circulation was detected in the absence of poliomyelitis cases in 2013 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-poliomyelitis-eradication/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. As fewer polio cases are detected by AFP surveillance, environmental surveillance activities are expanding in high-risk areas in Africa and Asia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17939883\"><span class=\"h2\">Mop-up activities</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Mop-up campaigns are door-to-door SIAs that are carried out in focal areas where the virus is known or suspected to still be circulating. Priority areas include those where polio cases have been found over the previous three years and where access to healthcare is difficult. Other criteria include high population density, high population mobility, poor sanitation, and low routine immunization coverage.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17939897\"><span class=\"h1\">CHALLENGES TO ERADICATION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17939904\"><span class=\"h2\">Operational challenges</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Polio eradication has encountered numerous challenges, including variable commitment from national authorities, religious and cultural opposition, inadequate funding, poor campaign quality, surveillance gaps, and slow response to outbreaks [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-poliomyelitis-eradication/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In addition, extremist groups perpetrating violence against oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=poliovirus-vaccine-inactivated-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">poliovirus vaccine</a> (OPV) campaign workers in the remaining endemic areas deny access to hundreds of thousands of unvaccinated children.</p><p>In response, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) has extensively improved supplementary immunization activity (SIA) planning, conduct, and monitoring, enhanced acute flaccid paralysis (AFP) surveillance, and initiated environmental surveillance in high-risk areas. The program now integrates polio vaccination with routine immunization and other key health interventions, engaged government, traditional, and religious leaders at all levels, aggressively supported social mobilization teams to improve communication and advocacy locally, and introduced innovations designed to improve polio vaccine delivery, such as global positioning system mapping and creation of immunization stations at transit points during population movements.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17939911\"><span class=\"h2\">Scientific challenges</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Two scientific challenges have fundamentally altered the strategies and goals of the GPEI. The first is the recognition of <strong>reduced effectiveness of OPV</strong> in locations with a high burden of enteric pathogens that can result in seroconversion rates of less than 20 percent per dose of trivalent OPV in some locations. This leaves many children who have received multiple doses still susceptible to polio [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-poliomyelitis-eradication/abstract/7,13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">7,13,14</a>]. The elimination of naturally occurring type 2 polioviruses allowed for a partial solution to this problem: deployment of monovalent type 1 vaccine and bivalent types 1 and 3 vaccine in SIAs, which induces improved immune responses to type 1 and type 3 polioviruses by removing the interfering type 2 OPV viruses from the formulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-poliomyelitis-eradication/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. The monovalent and bivalent formulations were instrumental in control of polio in India.</p><p>The second challenge was revealed when an outbreak of poliomyelitis caused by a strain derived from type 1 OPV vaccine occurred on the island of Hispaniola in 2000 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-poliomyelitis-eradication/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. The availability of viral genetic sequencing subsequently uncovered other <strong>circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus (cVDPV)</strong> outbreaks including extensive transmission of a type 2 VDPV virus in Egypt in the 1980s and periodic outbreaks caused by all three OPV types in multiple locations with low population that permit ongoing person-to-person transmission [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-poliomyelitis-eradication/abstract/16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">16,17</a>]. By definition, VDPV viruses diverge by &ge;1.0 percent in the VP1 coding region compared with the parent OPV strains (&ge;0.6 percent for type 2), signifying ongoing transmission for &ge;6 to 12 months. Since 2005, approximately 80 percent of cases occurring during cVDPV outbreaks have been caused by type 2 OPV virus. The recognition of cVDPVs dictates that all OPV use will need to cease to achieve full polio eradication.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1627579162\"><span class=\"h1\">PROGRESS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Between 1988 and 2013, the annual global incidence of poliomyelitis fell by &gt;99.9 percent (from more than 350,000 cases to fewer than 1000 cases). In February 2014, India was certified by the World Health Organization to have eradicated polio, a monumental achievement by a country that once harbored 85 percent of the global polio burden. Nigeria, the last country in Africa with endemic polio, experienced a two-year absence of reported cases between July 2014 and August 2016, when four cases emerged in the setting of poor access and mass migration due to armed conflict, and none thereafter as of September 2017. Worldwide, 37 cases were reported in 2016 and, as of September 2017, 11 cases were confirmed to have occurred, all in Pakistan and Afghanistan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-poliomyelitis-eradication/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>All naturally occurring polio cases since 2012 have been caused by wild-type poliovirus type 1. In 2015, there were 32 acute flaccid paralysis cases caused by circulating vaccine-derived poliovirus in 7 countries.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17939918\"><span class=\"h1\">ENDGAME STRATEGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Planning for success, the Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) roadmap calls for the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cessation of circulating wild-type poliovirus by mid-2018</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Planned discontinuation of all OPV once polio eradication is certified by the World Health Organization (WHO) approximately three years after the last reported case</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Eventual transfer of (legacy) assets of the GPEI to support other critical global health priorities such as immunization system strengthening, introduction of new vaccines, and control of malaria, measles, and neglected tropical diseases</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H233894547\"><span class=\"h2\">Transition to inactivated vaccine</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Because of an uncertain risk of cVDPV reemergence from residual oral poliovirus type 2 circulation and from immunodeficient, long-term VDPV excretors, inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) has been added to the recommended Expanded Program on Immunization (EPI) schedule for current OPV-using countries. Beginning in 2015, all countries using OPV added &ge;1 IPV dose to the infant immunization schedule at &ge;14 weeks of age at the recommendation of the WHO Strategic Advisory Group of Experts (SAGE) on immunization [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-poliomyelitis-eradication/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. This recommendation is based on IPV availability and affordability, and reduction in the risk of disease among vaccinated children in the event of type 2 cVDPV exposure. This strategy enhances immunity to types 1 and 3 in two ways: by improving the immunogenicity of OPV with the removal of type 2 vaccine virus and by enhancing immunity in children who receive bivalent OPV and IPV during routine infant immunization. Trials in India and Latin America confirm very high type 1 and type 3 seroconversion rates (&gt;98 percent) and acceptable seroconversion to type 2 (68 to 73 percent) in infants given bivalent OPV at 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age plus one IPV dose at 14 weeks of age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-poliomyelitis-eradication/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>].</p><p>Conventional wisdom associates intestinal mucosal immunity, which reduces poliovirus excretion and person-to-person transmission, to OPV alone. However, studies in India have shown that IPV administered to children previously given OPV boosts both humoral neutralizing antibody and intestinal mucosal immunity as measured by bivalent OPV challenge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-poliomyelitis-eradication/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>].</p><p>Although virtually all high-income and many middle-income countries have eliminated polio with IPV alone, it is questionable whether similar success can be achieved in locations challenged by crowding and poor sanitation. Experience in Israel with prolonged detection of type 1 polioviruses in sewage effluents has generated substantial concern that IPV-induced intestinal immunity may not prevent silent transmission in developing countries despite high immunization rates and that infection could spread extensively before the first clinical case is detected [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-poliomyelitis-eradication/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>].</p><p>Eventually, all countries will rely on IPV alone to prevent poliovirus after total OPV withdrawal now anticipated to occur by 2021 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/global-poliomyelitis-eradication/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In April 2017, SAGE recommended that countries currently using bOPV plan to replace all OPV with 2 IPV doses at 14 weeks and approximately 9 months of age. Furthermore, SAGE recommended that IPV continue to be included in routine immunization schedules for a minimum of 10 years following certification of eradication. How long IPV vaccination will continue thereafter will be based on projected risk of recurrent polio, cost, and feasibility. The availability of affordable standalone IPV and IPV-containing combination vaccines will continue to guide the IPV market during this period.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17939925\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Global Polio Eradication Initiative (GPEI) partnership is led by five organizations: the World Health Organization, the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the United Nations Children's Fund, Rotary International, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
