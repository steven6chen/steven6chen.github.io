Muscle weakness due to dysfunction of the neuromuscular junction (myasthenia) may be an acquired disorder. The vast majority of patients who develop myasthenia in adolescence or adulthood have autoantibodies that play a pathogenetically important role by attacking the acetylcholine receptor (AChR), fixing complement, and reducing the number of AChRs over time. These autoantibodies are thought to originate in hyperplastic germinal centers in the thymus where myoid cells expressing AChR are clustered. Such antibody-mediated disease is referred to as myasthenia gravis.</p><p>Similar weakness can also result from mutation of components of the neuromuscular junction, resulting in a group of disorders collectively referred to as &quot;congenital myasthenia.&quot; This type of myasthenia is often appreciated at birth. Congenital myasthenia and weakness in newborns that is due to transplacental passage of antibodies from a pregnant woman with myasthenia gravis are presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=neuromuscular-junction-disorders-in-newborns-and-infants\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Neuromuscular junction disorders in newborns and infants&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The pathogenesis of myasthenia gravis is discussed in this topic review. Other aspects of this disorder are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-myasthenia-gravis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of myasthenia gravis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-myasthenia-gravis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of myasthenia gravis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-myasthenia-gravis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of myasthenia gravis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Myasthenia gravis is a condition that fulfills all the major criteria for a disorder mediated by autoantibodies against the acetylcholine receptor (AChR) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The autoantibodies are present in 80 to 90 percent of affected patients</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The autoantibodies react with a specific antigen, the acetylcholine receptor</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The condition can be passively transferred by the autoantibodies to an animal model, producing a similar clinical condition</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Repeated injection of the human antigen in other species produces a model disease</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reduction in autoantibody levels is associated with clinical improvement</p><p/><p>There are several observations indicating that the AChR antibody is directly responsible for the clinical symptoms. As an example, a decrease in the number of active acetylcholine receptors has been demonstrated to occur as a consequence of AChR antibody binding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This may be due to autoantibody binding alone early in the disorder, but destruction of receptors eventually occurs via a complement-mediated process [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>However, the linkage between AChR antibodies and myasthenia gravis is not absolute. The plasma concentration of AChR antibodies does not correlate well with the severity of the disease, although in individual patients, changing autoantibody levels can be used to monitor treatment efficacy. Furthermore, 10 to 20 percent of patients with myasthenia gravis have no detectable levels of autoantibodies against the AChR. A proportion of these patients (40 to 70 percent) have antibodies directed against the muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase (MuSK). Accumulating evidence suggests that autoantibodies directed against MuSK and perhaps other postsynaptic neuromuscular junction components have a pathogenic role in the development of myasthenia gravis. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'MuSK antibodies'</a> below and <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Seronegative myasthenia'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Acetylcholine receptor antibody subtypes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Individual patients have a mix of immunologically different antibodies to the acetylcholine receptor. In addition, there is little similarity between patients with regard to AChR antibody subtypes. This is partly due to the heterogeneity of the receptor. The receptor of skeletal muscle consists of five different subunits, which associate to form a transmembrane ion channel [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Individual variation can occur among patients and among muscles in the same patient. In addition, antibodies to the same receptor in a patient with myasthenia gravis can vary in their light-chain and subclass types [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. This heterogeneity has important implications for treatment, since it means that the B lymphocytes producing the AChR antibodies are also heterogeneous.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">MuSK antibodies</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some patients with myasthenia gravis who are seronegative for AChR antibodies have antibodies directed against another target on the surface of the muscle membrane, the muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase (MuSK) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. MuSK autoantibodies have been found in 40 to 70 percent of Caucasian patients with AChR-seronegative myasthenia gravis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/8,10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,10,11</a>], and a report from Japan showed a similar rate of MuSK positivity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The prevalence of MuSK antibody positive myasthenia may be lower among Asians; a study from Taiwan found MuSK autoantibodies in only 4 percent of Chinese patients with AChR-seronegative myasthenia gravis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Earlier reports found no MuSK autoantibodies in patients with myasthenia who were seropositive for AChR antibody [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/8,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,10</a>]. However, using a recombinant human MuSK protein radioimmunoprecipitation assay, MuSK autoantibodies were detected in 10.5 percent of patients with AChR antibody positive myasthenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].</p><p>MuSK antibody positive myasthenia may have a different cause and pathologic mechanism than AChR-antibody positive disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. In contrast to AChR antibody-positive myasthenia gravis, in which complement fixing IgG1 and IgG3 subclasses predominate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>], MuSK antibodies are mainly IgG4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], the IgG subtype that does not activate complement. However, there is evidence that IgG1 subclass antibodies are also present at a low concentration and are capable of activating complement when bound to MuSK [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. This may account for some of the pathology associated with MuSK antibodies.</p><p>The MuSK protein is a transmembrane component of the postsynaptic neuromuscular junction. During neuromuscular junction formation, the MuSK complex mediates the clustering of AChRs that is induced by a nerve-derived proteoglycan called agrin, which binds to lipoprotein-related protein 4 (LRP4), leading to the activation of MuSK [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Activated MuSK interacts with the cytoplasmic adaptor protein Dok7 and initiates intracellular signalling systems that recruit AChR binding proteins including rapsyn to promote clustering of AChRs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/16-18\" class=\"abstract_t\">16-18</a>]. In addition, the collagen Q tail of acetylcholinesterase binds to perlecan and MuSK, thereby anchoring acetylcholinesterase to the neuromuscular junction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F50624\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50624 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. MuSK is also expressed in the mature neuromuscular junction and is likely important for its maintenance. Thus, it is biologically plausible that MuSK autoantibodies could produce myasthenia. However, the role of anti-MuSK antibodies in the pathogenesis of myasthenia gravis is not fully understood. The following reports illustrate the range of findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Autoantibodies to the extracellular domain of MuSK strongly inhibit MuSK function in cultured myotubes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In animal models, active immunization with various purified extracellular MuSK domains is associated with the development of MuSK autoantibodies, myasthenic weakness, electromyographic evidence of a postsynaptic neuromuscular junction disorder, reduced AChR clustering, and other morphologic disruptions of the neuromuscular junction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">21,22</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Passive transfer of IgG from patients with MuSK-antibody positive and AChR-antibody negative myasthenia gravis into mice reduced the density of the postsynaptic AChR and disrupted the neuromuscular junction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In one patient with AChR antibody negative myasthenia and a high titer of MuSK autoantibodies, no evidence supporting MuSK antibodies as the cause of myasthenic symptoms was found despite comprehensive immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, and electrophysiologic methods [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Nevertheless, the amplitudes of miniature end plate potentials were reduced compared with normal values on in vitro electrophysiologic study of muscle biopsy from this patient.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A report that examined muscle biopsies from 10 patients who had MuSK antibodies with AChR antibody negative myasthenia gravis found that MuSK antibodies were not associated with loss of AChR at the end plate, complement deposition, or morphologic damage on muscle biopsy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A third study demonstrated reduced amplitude of miniature end plate potentials using in-vitro electrophysiologic study of a muscle biopsy specimen from a patient with MuSK myasthenia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Histologic examination revealed some areas of partially denervated endplates and other areas with some degenerating postsynaptic folds.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Human IgG purified from patients with MuSK-antibody positive myasthenia interferes with the binding of the collagen Q subunit of acetylcholinesterase to MuSK receptors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. Other experimental studies have shown that AChR clustering is perturbed in the absence of collagen Q [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>], suggesting that a similar mechanism is important in the pathogenesis of MuSK antibody related myasthenia gravis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>].</p><p/><p>There are important differences between MuSK and AChR antibody positive myasthenia gravis in clinical features, including symptom complex and response to pharmacologic treatment with acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, glucocorticoids, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. These are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-myasthenia-gravis#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of myasthenia gravis&quot;, section on 'MuSK antibodies'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Seronegative myasthenia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term seronegative myasthenia gravis (SNMG), also called antibody negative myasthenia gravis, originally referred to patients with myasthenia gravis who had negative standard assays for AChR antibodies. As testing for MuSK antibodies became more prevalent, a subset of patients with myasthenia gravis who had no detectable antibodies directed to AChR or MuSK was observed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]. This group of patients is increasingly referred to as having seronegative myasthenia gravis, although some have used the term double-seronegative to mean the absence of both AChR and MuSK antibodies. Seronegative myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder with most of the same features as seropositive myasthenia gravis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>]. The electrophysiologic findings are identical.</p><p>Standard assays for AChR antibodies may fail to detect some patients with AChR-antibody related MG due to suboptimal sensitivity. However, when tested by a specialized cell-based immunofluorescence assay, up to one-half of patients with seronegative myasthenia gravis by standard assays have clustered AChR antibodies (also called low-affinity AChR antibodies) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/15,33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">15,33,34</a>]. These clustered AChR antibodies bind to high densities of AChRs as found at the neuromuscular junction. They can activate complement and passively transfer disease to mice. However, the assay for clustered AChR antibodies is not widely available, and the role of these antibodies in the pathogenesis of myasthenia gravis requires further confirmation.</p><p>Antibodies to other self-antigens have been detected in various reports of patients with seronegative myasthenia gravis (ie, those who lack both AChR and MuSK antibodies), although their pathogenicity is not established:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antibodies to lipoprotein-related protein 4 (LRP4), the agrin-binding receptor of the MuSK complex (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F50624\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef50624 \">figure 1</a>), have been found in up to 50 percent of patients with seronegative myasthenia gravis, [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/35-37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35-37</a>]. In the two largest studies, autoantibodies to LRP4 were detected in 2 and 9 percent, respectively, of such patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/35,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,37</a>]. These antibodies are primarily of the IgG1 subclass capable of activating complement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. In addition, they inhibit the binding of LRP4 with neural agrin and disrupt agrin-induced AChR clustering in vitro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/35,37\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,37</a>]. Therefore, it is plausible that antibodies to LRP4 are pathogenic in some cases of seronegative myasthenia gravis. However, additional research is needed to confirm this hypothesis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cortactin is a protein that mediates clustering of AChR at the neuromuscular junction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In a retrospective report, cortactin antibodies were found in 24 percent of 38 patients with seronegative myasthenia gravis, 10 percent of 201 patients with AChR antibody-associated myasthenia gravis, and none of 11 patients with MuSK antibody-associated myasthenia gravis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p/><p>Other studies have identified antibodies to various intracellular muscle proteins, including the ryanodine receptor, titin, myosin, alpha actin, actin, rapsyn, and gravin, in both seropositive and seronegative myasthenia gravis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/40-42\" class=\"abstract_t\">40-42</a>]. However, it remains problematic how antibodies against these proteins can produce their effects in intact muscle cells. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'The thymus and the origin of autoimmunity in myasthenia'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Role of T cells</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>T lymphocytes are also important in myasthenia gravis. They are not found in pathologic specimens, suggesting that they do not act as effector cells. They can, however, bind to the acetylcholine receptor and their main role is thought to be stimulation of B cell antibody production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. As with AChR antibodies, T cell binding is heterogeneous, a factor that must be addressed by immunotherapy.</p><p>Anti-T cell receptor antibodies may play a role in immunoregulation in myasthenia. This was illustrated by a study of 40 patients that compared their specific anti-T cell receptor (anti-v-beta-5.1) circulating IgG antibody levels with those of healthy and other disease controls [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/44\" class=\"abstract_t\">44</a>]. While there was an overall increase in the mean antibody titer in those with myasthenia versus controls, there was an inverse correlation between the severity of myasthenia and the antibody titer. Among those with mild, versus moderate or severe disease, elevated titers of anti-v-beta 5.1 antibody were present in 92 and 11 percent of patients, respectively. This finding has suggested the possibility that measures that could increase antibodies to potentially pathogenic T cell receptors might have a role in therapy of myasthenia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">The thymus and the origin of autoimmunity in myasthenia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of patients with AChR antibody positive myasthenia gravis have thymic abnormalities: hyperplasia in 60 to 70 percent and thymoma in 10 to 12 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Furthermore, the disease often improves or disappears after thymectomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. As a result, the thymus has been evaluated as a possible source of antigen to drive this autoimmune disease.</p><p>The thymus contains a small number of &quot;myoid&quot; cells. These cells are distinguished by striations and the presence of AChR on their surface and are the only known cells to express intact AChR outside of muscle. In addition, thymic epithelial cells produce unfolded AChR subunits that are hypothesized to prime helper T cells. These &quot;autoimmunized&quot; T cells then attack the AChR on myoid cells and create infiltrating germinal centers in the hyperplastic thymus where deposition of complement is found associated with the myoid cells. The autoimmunization completes as the antibodies in the germinal centers diversify to recognize intact muscle AChR [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/45,46\" class=\"abstract_t\">45,46</a>]. Thus, all of the elements necessary to produce and promote autoimmunity reside in microenvironments in the hyperplastic thymus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/47\" class=\"abstract_t\">47</a>].</p><p>Antigen presentation by thymic cells via MHC class II molecules may be abnormal in patients with myasthenia. In particular, overexpression of cathepsin V, one of the enzymes responsible for cleaving the invariant chain that occupies the antigen presenting cleft of the MHC type II molecule, has been noted in the thymic tissue of patients with myasthenia and thymoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. Increased production of this enzyme is present in the frankly neoplastic thymic tissue as well as in area of inflamed gland (thymitis). Expression of mRNA and cathepsin V protein are not increased in the thymic tissue of patients with thymomas who do not have myasthenia. Other than the important role of the cathepsins in antigen processing cells, a link between enzyme overexpression and autoantibody production is unclear. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antigen-presenting-cells#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antigen-presenting cells&quot;, section on 'Antigen processing'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antigen-presenting-cells#H11\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antigen-presenting cells&quot;, section on 'Loading of MHC II molecules'</a>.)</p><p>It seems likely that genetic factors also contribute to the pathogenesis of myasthenia gravis. Certain HLA types have been associated with myasthenia, including HLA-B8, DRw3, and DQw2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. MuSK antibody positive myasthenia is associated with haplotypes DR14 and DQ5 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. Although the factors that initiate and maintain the immune response in myasthenia gravis are unknown, there is some evidence that Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) may play a role. One study found active EBV infection in the thymus of all 17 patients with myasthenia gravis and in none of six control patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>]. In addition, patients with myasthenia frequently have other immune-mediated diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, Graves' disease, and thyroiditis, and a family history of autoimmune disorders.</p><p>The role of thymoma in autoimmunity is not as clear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>]. It is unknown why some patients with thymoma develop myasthenia while others do not:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The subtype of thymoma may be important; the development of myasthenia was significantly associated with mixed thymomas, but not with thymomas of the cortical type [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].

Among patients with myasthenia gravis, the presence of antititin antibodies is predictive of a thymic epithelial tumor (sensitivity 69 to 80 percent and specificity 90 to 100 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/53,56\" class=\"abstract_t\">53,56</a>].</p><p/><p>Patients who have late onset myasthenia without thymoma may also have titin or ryanodine receptor antibodies. There is some suggestion that these antibodies may be associated with worse prognosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/55,57\" class=\"abstract_t\">55,57</a>].</p><p>Finally, because AChR antibody levels do not clearly correlate with myasthenia gravis severity, investigators have continued to search for additional factors (eg, other muscle antibodies, secondary cytokines, chemokines) that might positively correlate with the disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]. As examples, the chemokines CXCL13 and CCL21 are overexpressed in hyperplastic thymus from individuals with myasthenia gravis and may play a pathologic role in the recruitment of lymphocytes to the thymus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/58,59\" class=\"abstract_t\">58,59</a>]. As another example, one study exposed cultured human muscle cells to sera from patients with myasthenia gravis of varying severity and observed a direct cytotoxic effect of the sera [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. This cytotoxic effect was not complement dependent, and ryanodine and titin antibodies were not consistently detected in all sera, suggesting the effect may not be autoantibody mediated. However, the cytotoxic effect correlated with disease severity, making this an interesting phenomenon for further investigation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H110405203\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder characterized by weakness and fatigability of skeletal muscles due to dysfunction of the neuromuscular junction. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myasthenia gravis is a condition that fulfills all the major criteria for a disorder mediated by autoantibodies against the acetylcholine receptor (AChR). However, the linkage between AChR antibodies and myasthenia gravis is not absolute; accumulating evidence suggests that autoantibodies directed against muscle-specific receptor tyrosine kinase (MuSK) and perhaps other postsynaptic neuromuscular junction components have a pathogenic role in the development of myasthenia gravis. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Pathogenesis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Individual patients have a mix of immunologically different antibodies to the AChR. This is partly due to the heterogeneity of the receptor. (See <a href=\"#H3\" class=\"local\">'Acetylcholine receptor antibody subtypes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some patients with myasthenia gravis who are seronegative for AChR antibodies have antibodies directed against another target on the surface of the muscle membrane, MuSK. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'MuSK antibodies'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seronegative myasthenia gravis, also called antibody negative myasthenia gravis, refers to the 6 to 12 percent of patients with myasthenia gravis who have negative standard assays for both AChR antibodies and MuSK antibodies. Seronegative myasthenia gravis is an autoimmune disorder with most of the same features as seropositive myasthenia gravis. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Seronegative myasthenia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>T lymphocytes are also important in myasthenia gravis; they can bind to the acetylcholine receptor and their main role is thought to be stimulation of B cell antibody production. (See <a href=\"#H6\" class=\"local\">'Role of T cells'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The majority of patients with AChR antibody positive myasthenia gravis have thymic abnormalities: hyperplasia in 60 to 70 percent and thymoma in 10 to 12 percent. Furthermore, the disease often improves or disappears after thymectomy. As a result, the thymus has been evaluated as a possible source of antigen to drive this autoimmune disease. (See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'The thymus and the origin of autoimmunity in myasthenia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p><strong>ACKNOWLEDGMENT</strong> &mdash; The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Walter Allan, MD, who contributed to earlier versions of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathogenesis-of-myasthenia-gravis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Drachman DB.
