This constellation of laboratory values has been referred to as euthyroid hyperthyroxinemia and hypothyroxinemia, respectively. The free T4 should be normal, but many assays will report slightly abnormal values; for example, the free T4 index and many direct free T4 assays report high values in familial dysalbuminemic hyperthyroxinemia (FDH).</p><p>In the past, these conditions presented a diagnostic challenge, and many of the patients with them were inappropriately treated for thyroid disease. Today, when most clinicians measure serum TSH as a screening test for thyroid function, a normal serum TSH value is usually not followed by measurement of a total serum T4. With the use of sensitive serum TSH assays and automated &quot;direct&quot; free T4 assays, euthyroid hyper- or hypothyroxinemia frequently remains undetected, with no harm to the patient.</p><p>However, the detection of a normal serum TSH concentration associated with a high or low serum T4 concentration, and sometimes free T4 concentration, should immediately alert the clinician to search for one of the causes of euthyroid hyper- or hypothyroxinemia, especially if the patient has no symptoms or signs of either hyper- or hypothyroidism.</p><p>This topic will review these conditions. Individual thyroid function tests are discussed in detail separately.

T4 binding is distributed as follows: TBG, 75 percent; TTR, 15 percent; and albumin, 10 percent. In comparison, T3 is less avidly bound to TBG and TTR.</p><p>Serum total T4 or T3 assays measure both bound and free (unbound) hormone.

Thus, serum TBG (and total T4 and T3) concentrations are increased substantially (25 to 50 percent) in pregnant women [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/euthyroid-hyperthyroxinemia-and-hypothyroxinemia/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], women receiving an oral contraceptive [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/euthyroid-hyperthyroxinemia-and-hypothyroxinemia/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>], postmenopausal women receiving estrogen therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/euthyroid-hyperthyroxinemia-and-hypothyroxinemia/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>], and patients with estrogen-secreting tumors, and serum TBG concentrations are increased slightly (10 to 25 percent) in women receiving <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tamoxifen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tamoxifen</a>&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/euthyroid-hyperthyroxinemia-and-hypothyroxinemia/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>] and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=raloxifene-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">raloxifene</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/euthyroid-hyperthyroxinemia-and-hypothyroxinemia/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hepatitis &ndash; Patients with acute or subacute hepatitis, even those with minimal elevations in serum aminotransferase concentrations, have increased serum TBG concentrations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/euthyroid-hyperthyroxinemia-and-hypothyroxinemia/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drugs &ndash; Several drugs raise serum TBG concentrations, including 5-fluorouracil [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/euthyroid-hyperthyroxinemia-and-hypothyroxinemia/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>], <a href=\"topic.htm?path=perphenazine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">perphenazine</a>, clofibrate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/euthyroid-hyperthyroxinemia-and-hypothyroxinemia/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], heroin, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methadone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methadone</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/euthyroid-hyperthyroxinemia-and-hypothyroxinemia/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute intermittent porphyria &ndash; Acute intermittent porphyria may be associated with increased serum TBG concentrations, via an uncertain mechanism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/euthyroid-hyperthyroxinemia-and-hypothyroxinemia/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The T3-resin uptake test was designed in part to detect abnormalities in serum TBG (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=laboratory-assessment-of-thyroid-function#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Laboratory assessment of thyroid function&quot;, section on 'T3-resin uptake'</a>). This test measures the number of unoccupied T4-binding sites in serum. It is performed by incubating the patient's serum with radiolabeled T3 and subsequently adding a resin (or other binder such as talc or dextran-coated charcoal) to bind any radiolabeled T3 not bound to serum proteins (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F72068\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72068 \">figure 1</a>). In states of TBG excess, more radiolabeled T3 binds to TBG and less to the resin, resulting in a low T3-resin uptake (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F72712\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef72712 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>The value in normal subjects is usually normalized to 1 (range 0.83 to 1.16). The thyroid hormone-binding ratio (THBR) or index (THBI) is the ratio of the patient's T3-resin uptake value to the mean of the values in normal subjects. The serum free T4 index, which has no units, is calculated by multiplying the serum total T4 value by the binding ratio:</p><div class=\"formulaContainer\"><div class=\"formula\"><p> &#160;Serum free T4 index &#160;= &#160;serum total T4 &#160;x &#160;THBR</p></div></div><p>The presence of TBG excess is suggested by a low THBR in a patient with an elevated serum total T4 (or T3) concentration. In a pregnant woman, for example, the serum total T4 concentration might be 14 <span class=\"nowrap\">mcg/dL</span> (180 <span class=\"nowrap\">nmol/L),</span> but the THBR might be 0.68. The serum free T4 index would be normal (9.5 [14 x 0.68]).</p><p>These changes are reversed in patients with TBG deficiency (see <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'TBG deficiency'</a> below). In these patients, little radiolabeled T3 binds to TBG and most binds to the resin. The net effect is that the THBR is high, leading to a normal serum free T4 index even though the serum total T4 concentration is low (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F65021\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65021 \">figure 3</a>).</p><p>In contrast, the T3-resin uptake and therefore the serum free T4 index are high and low, respectively, in hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism.</p><p>The changes in T3-resin uptake in TBG excess and deficiency and in hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism can be summarized as follows.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperthyroidism &ndash; High serum total T4, high T3-resin uptake or THBR, high serum free T4 index</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TBG excess &ndash; High serum total T4, low T3-resin uptake or THBR, normal serum free T4 index</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypothyroidism &ndash; Low serum total T4, low T3-resin uptake or THBR, low serum free T4 index</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>TBG deficiency &ndash; Low serum total T4, high T3-resin uptake or THBR, normal serum free T4 index</p><p/><p>At extremes of TBG excess or deficiency, the serum free T4 index may not be normal. However, the correct diagnosis can be established by demonstrating that the patient has a normal serum TSH concentration. In addition, serum TBG can be measured directly by radioimmunoassay, although this is rarely necessary.</p><p>In theory, direct free T4 assays should not be affected by changes in TBG. In practice, however, many automated free T4 assays perform poorly, especially in pregnancy and nonthyroidal illness, because they are adversely affected by the lower levels of albumin seen in pregnancy and nonthyroidal illness. Even though free T4 index measurements are normal in the second and third trimester, automated free T4 assays frequently give low values, and some kit manufacturers attempt to compensate for the poor performance of their assay by offering adjusted lower normal ranges during the second and third trimester [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/euthyroid-hyperthyroxinemia-and-hypothyroxinemia/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

It is characterized by production of mutant albumin molecules that have a low affinity but high capacity for T4, but not T3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/euthyroid-hyperthyroxinemia-and-hypothyroxinemia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Affected patients have high serum total T4 concentrations but are euthyroid and have normal serum TSH concentrations.</p><p>The increased binding of T4 in FDH results in a misleading T3-resin uptake because the radiolabeled T3 does not bind to the abnormal albumin but does bind normally to the resin and to other serum proteins (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F53941\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53941 \">figure 4</a>). The net effect is a high serum total T4 concentration and a normal THBR, so that the calculated serum free T4 index is high. Before sensitive serum TSH assays were available, these patients were commonly misdiagnosed as having hyperthyroidism and treated accordingly.</p><p>While, in theory, direct free T4 measurements should result in normal free T4 levels in FDH, in reality, most give spuriously high values, especially the analog methods, which are adversely affected by changes in albumin concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/euthyroid-hyperthyroxinemia-and-hypothyroxinemia/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>There is usually no need to pursue the diagnosis of FDH if the patient is clearly euthyroid and has a normal serum TSH concentration. However, the diagnosis can be established by performing a resin (or charcoal) uptake test using radiolabeled T4 rather than radiolabeled T3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/euthyroid-hyperthyroxinemia-and-hypothyroxinemia/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Serum from patients with FDH binds more radiolabeled T4 than does serum from normal subjects, thereby documenting that serum T4 binding is increased. The diagnosis can also be established by electrophoresis of binding proteins in the presence of radiolabeled T4. Alternatively, serum T4 and free T4 index can be measured in the patient's relatives; the inheritance of FDH is autosomal dominant.</p><p>A variant of FDH has been described in at least four Japanese families due to a novel mutation in codon 218 (R218P) of the albumin gene [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/euthyroid-hyperthyroxinemia-and-hypothyroxinemia/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. The clinical presentation differed from the patients described above; serum T4 concentrations were 11- to 17-fold above the upper limit of normal (versus two- to threefold), and serum T3 concentrations were elevated up to twofold above the upper limit of normal in some family members.</p><p>A variant of albumin with 40-fold increased affinity for T3 but only 1.5-fold increased affinity for T4 has been described in a Thai family: familial dysalbuminemic hypertriiodothyroninemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/euthyroid-hyperthyroxinemia-and-hypothyroxinemia/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Abnormal TTR binding of T4</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>This very rare disorder is due to production of an abnormal transthyretin (TTR) that, like the abnormal albumin in patients with FDH, binds T4 but not T3 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/euthyroid-hyperthyroxinemia-and-hypothyroxinemia/abstract/1,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,22</a>]. It can be diagnosed by either electrophoresis or by using anti-TTR antibodies to immunoprecipitate the protein in the presence of radiolabeled T4 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/euthyroid-hyperthyroxinemia-and-hypothyroxinemia/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Anti-T4 immunoglobulins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The presence of anti-T4 immunoglobulins, a rare finding, can cause spuriously high serum T4 concentrations when T4 is measured by radioimmunoassay, or low values in immunometric assays [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/euthyroid-hyperthyroxinemia-and-hypothyroxinemia/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. These immunoglobulins are antibodies that bind T4, but are distinct from antithyroglobulin (and antithyroid peroxidase) antibodies. Nonetheless, virtually all patients with these antibodies have autoimmune thyroid disease. Most patients have been euthyroid because enough serum T4 was unbound to maintain normal function at the tissue level.</p><p>These human anti-T4 antibodies cause spuriously high serum total T4 values in T4 radioimmunoassays because they bind radiolabeled T4, thereby competing with binding of radiolabeled T4 to the rabbit anti-T4 antibodies used in the assays, which then interferes with the competition between labeled and endogenous T4 binding (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ENDO%2F75308\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef75308 \">figure 5</a>). On the other hand, the THBR is normal because most endogenous anti-T4 antibodies do not bind T3.

Most of the fall in serum free T4 and T3 concentrations appears to be artifactual. Serum free T4 is usually measured in diluted serum, and dilution of the anticonvulsant drug diminishes its ability to displace T4 from binding proteins. As a result, some of the free T4 becomes bound during the assay, lowering the measured value [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/euthyroid-hyperthyroxinemia-and-hypothyroxinemia/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>].

The free T4 index may be normal or just slightly abnormal, but in some instances, it will also be increased (eg, familial dysalbuminemic hyperthyroxinemia [FDH]). Many automated direct free T4 measurements give spurious results in patients with these conditions, especially in the presence of quantitative or qualitative changes in serum albumin concentrations. Today, when most clinicians measure serum TSH as a screening test for thyroid function and most labs are using automated &quot;direct&quot; free T4 assays, a normal serum TSH value is usually not followed by measurement of a total serum T4. As a result, euthyroid hyper- or hypothyroxinemia may go undetected, with no harm to the patient.
