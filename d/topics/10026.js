In addition, treatment can cause considerable morbidity, including loss of swallowing and larynx function.</p><p>In an effort to improve cure rates and functional outcomes, chemotherapy has been integrated into various multimodality approaches. These approaches have been applied for both patients with unresectable cancers and those with resectable disease who prefer a non-surgical organ preservation technique.</p><p>Combined modality functional organ preservation approaches that have been studied in patients with locoregionally advanced head and neck cancer in addition to definitive RT alone include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Induction (neoadjuvant) chemotherapy (chemotherapy prior to surgery <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> RT)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Concurrent chemoradiotherapy, in which chemotherapy is administered at the same time as RT.

Even with significant tumor volume reduction, the target volume should be based upon the anatomic compartments that encompass the pretreatment sites of gross disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Induction chemotherapy could treat subclinical distant metastatic disease without delay.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Induction chemotherapy could improve local regional control and organ preservation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The administration of chemotherapy concurrently with RT may sensitize tumor cells to the effects of radiation and thus overcome radiation resistance. Reduction of repopulation between radiation treatment fractions may also contribute to the benefits of concurrent chemotherapy. This could improve locoregional control and organ preservation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methods-to-overcome-radiation-resistance-in-head-and-neck-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Methods to overcome radiation resistance in head and neck cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Induction chemotherapy can provide prognostic information to select chemoradiotherapy treatment intensity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sequential therapy, the combination of induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy, may combine the benefits of both induction chemotherapy and concurrent chemoradiotherapy.</p><p/><p>However, concurrent chemoradiotherapy alone may be preferred since the use of induction chemotherapy prior to RT can be associated with increased toxicity, which may limit patient compliance and delay or prevent the completion of definitive local therapy. Likewise, if induction chemotherapy is ineffective, it will delay definitive local therapy. Furthermore, the use of induction chemotherapy, either alone or followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy, may induce cross-resistance to subsequent RT or chemoradiotherapy.</p><p>Functional organ preservation approaches may not be appropriate and surgery may be preferred when the tumor has already destroyed the organ. This situation occurs most frequently in patients with far advanced laryngeal cancer.

In all trials, patients were randomly assigned to definitive locoregional therapy alone (surgery <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> RT) or definitive locoregional therapy in combination with chemotherapy (induction, concurrent, or adjuvant). The trials included patients with oral cavity, oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal and laryngeal cancers; trials that were limited to patients with primary nasopharyngeal tumors were excluded. The primary endpoint of the MACH-NC meta-analysis was overall survival.</p><p>Results from this meta-analysis include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Concurrent chemotherapy &ndash; Concurrent chemotherapy was assessed in 50 trials that included 9605 patients. Mean follow-up was 5.6 years. Concurrent chemotherapy significantly decreased the risk of death compared with definitive local therapy alone (hazard ratio [HR] 0.81, 95% CI 0.78-0.86); this correlated with a 6.5 percent absolute decrease in mortality at five years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The benefit was due to a decrease in cancer-related deaths, and no increase in non-cancer deaths was observed with concurrent chemotherapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>No statistically significant differences were observed with different RT schedules (once daily versus altered fractionation).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>There was a statistically significant decrease in effect from concurrent chemotherapy with increasing patient age, and no benefit was observed in those over age 70 years.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Induction chemotherapy &ndash; In 31 trials with 5311 patients, there was no statistically significant effect on overall survival from induction chemotherapy compared with surgery <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> RT alone (HR 0.96, 95% CI 0.90-1.02). When results were analyzed based upon the induction chemotherapy regimen, overall survival with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a> (PF) was significantly better than with surgery <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> RT alone (HR 0.90, 95% CI 0.82-0.99), whereas there was no difference for other regimens or single agent chemotherapy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Concurrent chemoradiotherapy versus induction chemotherapy &ndash; Only six trials, involving 861 patients, directly compared concurrent chemoradiotherapy with various induction chemotherapy regimens followed by definitive locoregional therapy. Analysis of these trials did not demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in overall survival with concurrent therapy compared with induction therapy (HR 0.90, p = 0.15). Secondary analyses suggested that concurrent chemoradiotherapy was more effective at preventing locoregional failure, while induction chemotherapy provided a relatively more pronounced effect on distant metastases.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Adjuvant chemotherapy &ndash; In six trials with 2567 patients that assessed the impact of adjuvant chemotherapy, there was no improvement in overall survival compared with definitive local therapy alone (HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.95-1.16).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1049946399\"><span class=\"h2\">Induction plus concurrent chemotherapy versus concurrent chemotherapy alone</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The optimal timing and integration of chemotherapy with RT remains uncertain. Based upon the demonstrated benefit of concurrent chemoradiotherapy over RT alone and the decrease in distant metastases seen with induction chemotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/locally-advanced-squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-head-and-neck-approaches-combining-chemotherapy-and-radiation-therapy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>], sequential induction followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy has been proposed as the optimal way to incorporate chemotherapy with locoregional therapy.</p><p>Multiple clinical trials have studied the question of whether sequential chemoradiotherapy offers a significant benefit compared with concurrent chemoradiotherapy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/locally-advanced-squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-head-and-neck-approaches-combining-chemotherapy-and-radiation-therapy/abstract/4-8\" class=\"abstract_t\">4-8</a>]. These are illustrated by the three largest trials, which are heterogenous in design and treatment and which resulted in different conclusions:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a trial conducted by the Spanish Head and Neck Cancer Cooperative Group, 439 patients with stage III or IV squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck were randomly assigned to concurrent chemoradiotherapy alone (seven weeks of RT plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> on days 1, 22, and 43) or induction chemotherapy with three cycles of one of two regimens (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=docetaxel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">docetaxel</a>, cisplatin, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a> [TPF] or PF), followed by the same concurrent chemoradiotherapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/locally-advanced-squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-head-and-neck-approaches-combining-chemotherapy-and-radiation-therapy/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">There were no statistically significant differences in the progression-free survival, time-to-treatment failure, or overall survival between the three treatment arms. Notably completion of therapy as planned on the two sequential arms would involve 525 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> or 600 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> total <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a>. Perhaps for this and other reasons, approximately half of patients did not complete radiation <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> concurrent chemotherapy as planned, and thus, analysis by intention to treat showed no survival benefit. A secondary analysis restricted to patients who completed treatment per protocol showed a statistically significant benefit in progression-free survival in those patients receiving induction chemotherapy with TPF.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a phase <span class=\"nowrap\">II/III</span> Italian trial, 421 patients with locally advanced (stage III or IV) squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck were randomly assigned to induction chemotherapy with three cycles of TPF followed by chemoradiotherapy, or to immediate chemoradiotherapy, and 414 were fully evaluable [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/locally-advanced-squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-head-and-neck-approaches-combining-chemotherapy-and-radiation-therapy/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Within each group patients were secondarily randomized to concurrent chemotherapy with two cycles of PF or to concurrent <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cetuximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cetuximab</a>. Thus, two groups received concomitant chemoradiotherapy alone, with either PF or cetuximab, and two groups received induction chemotherapy with TPF, followed by concomitant chemoradiotherapy with either PF or cetuximab.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">At a median follow-up of 44.8 months, treatment with induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy significantly improved overall survival compared with concurrent chemoradiotherapy alone (median 54 versus 30 months, three-year survival rate 58 versus 47 percent, HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.56-0.97). Similarly, progression-free survival was also significantly improved with induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy (median 30 versus 19 months, three-year survival rate 47 versus 39 percent, HR 0.72, 95% CI 0. 56-0.93).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Locoregional failure was also lower in the induction chemotherapy arm, but unlike in other studies, distant failure was not reduced with chemoradiotherapy. While not powered to make such conclusions, there was a trend to more benefit when induction chemotherapy was added to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cetuximab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cetuximab</a>. While there may be a biological explanation for this difference, this may reflect inferiority of the cetuximab regimen, which has not yet been directly compared with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cisplatin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">cisplatin</a> in studies that have mature data. Additionally, there was a trend towards more benefit in non-oropharynx sites. It should be noted that by eligibility this was a poor prognosis group with nearly 75 percent of patients having T3 or T4 disease. It was notable that neutropenia was higher during chemoradiotherapy in the induction chemotherapy groups, but non-hematologic toxicity was not increased. Notably, this study was designed in the &quot;pre-human papillomavirus (HPV)&quot; era, and as such, no data are available differentiating benefit in HPV versus non-HPV patients.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the DeCIDE trial, 280 treatment-na&iuml;ve patients with N2 or N3 squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck were randomly assigned to induction with two cycles of TPF followed by chemoradiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/locally-advanced-squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-head-and-neck-approaches-combining-chemotherapy-and-radiation-therapy/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Chemoradiotherapy consisted of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=docetaxel-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">docetaxel</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyurea</a> (given as five &quot;cycles&quot; in combination with RT at 150 cGy twice daily, repeated every other week).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The primary endpoint was overall survival. The original statistical plan was to include 400 patients; this was subsequently amended to 280 patients because of slower than expected accrual, but duration of the study was extended to allow for additional events. With a minimum follow-up of 2.5 years, overall survival was significantly better than originally anticipated, with similar mortality rates in the two arms (28 percent with induction chemotherapy plus chemoradiotherapy versus 31 percent in the chemoradiotherapy alone arm at 3.5 years). There were no statistically significant differences in overall survival, the primary endpoint of the study (hazard ratio 0.91, 95% CI 0.59-1.41), in recurrence-free survival, or disease-free survival.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The goal of this trial was to improve overall survival through a decrease in the incidence of distant metastases and high risk <span class=\"nowrap\">(N2/N3)</span> patients. The incidence of distant metastases was reduced, but the absence of an improvement in survival may have been due to the difference in treatment-related mortality (5 versus 0 percent in the sequential and concurrent treatment groups, respectively).</p><p/><p>The role of induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy (sequential therapy) versus concurrent chemoradiotherapy alone as assessed in these and other trials remains controversial due to the conflicting results. Some of the factors that contribute to the difficulties in interpretation include differences in trial design, intensity and choice of chemotherapy regimens, and differences in patient populations (especially the proportion of HPV-positive patients who may have a better prognosis and thus require less aggressive therapy to maximize tumor control).</p><p>Although the Spanish trial rightly used intention to treat in concluding no benefit, the Italian trial demonstrated higher induction and chemoradiotherapy treatment completion rates than the Spanish trial, and their progression-free survival difference was similar to the per protocol patient analysis in the Italian trial. Finally, in the DeCIDE trial, there was in total seven cycles of systemically active chemotherapy in the induction group (counting the TFHX [<a href=\"topic.htm?path=paclitaxel-conventional-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">paclitaxel</a>, infusional <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fluorouracil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fluorouracil</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=hydroxyurea-hydroxycarbamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">hydroxyurea</a>, and RT]) versus five in the chemoradiotherapy group. This large total amount of chemotherapy in both groups may have dampened the difference and led to high survival numbers in both groups.</p><p>The use of sequential therapy should be an individual <span class=\"nowrap\">clinician/patient</span> decision but generally is reserved for those healthy patients at high risk for both distant and locoregional recurrence. The subgroup of patients that may benefit most are those with bulky N2b or N2c, or N3 nodal stage, and perhaps the T3 and T4 populations as suggested by subgroup analysis of the DeCIDE trial and Italian trial, as well as the established higher risk of incurable distant failure in this patient subset and numerous studies demonstrating the role of induction chemotherapy on reducing the rate of distant metastases.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1049946406\"><span class=\"h2\">Patient selection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Combined approaches using chemotherapy and definitive radiotherapy are used in patients with both resectable and unresectable disease. The definitions of resectable and unresectable disease vary among practitioners and a large fraction of resectable patients can be treated non-surgically in an effort to preserve organ anatomy and function:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients whose disease is considered resectable, concurrent chemoradiotherapy with or without induction chemotherapy may be useful as an approach for functional organ preservation.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the disease is unresectable then the addition of chemotherapy to radiation therapy or (in patients not considered to be candidates for multimodality therapy) radiation therapy alone are the only treatment options. Such treatment may render the patient free of disease and may result in functional organ preservation. In some cases with persistent disease following completion of chemoradiotherapy, salvage surgery can be performed.</p><p/><p>Induction chemotherapy <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> concurrent chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced head and neck cancer is associated with significant toxicity that can result in treatment delays or interruptions. Appropriate patient selection is critical to successfully complete therapy. The patient's performance status, comorbidities, age, and psychosocial support network are important factors that need to be considered prior to proceeding with a combined modality approach.</p><p>Key factors to consider in selecting appropriate treatment for an individual patient include the following:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Most randomized clinical trials limited enrollment to patients with minimal comorbidities and a good performance status (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG] 0 and 1 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F72901\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72901 \">table 1</a>)).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Although the elderly have been successfully treated, the MACH-NC meta-analysis found that older patients are less likely to benefit from the addition of chemotherapy to definitive locoregional treatment and the meta-analysis could not demonstrate a benefit in those over 70 years. In fact there is suggestion that in those over 80, the addition of chemotherapy may be harmful [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/locally-advanced-squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-head-and-neck-approaches-combining-chemotherapy-and-radiation-therapy/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Age alone should not be used as a criterion in selecting treatment approaches; rather comorbidities and performance status should be critically assessed in all patients, especially in the elderly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/locally-advanced-squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-head-and-neck-approaches-combining-chemotherapy-and-radiation-therapy/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

Frequent acute severe (grade 3 and 4) adverse events were hematologic side effects, stomatitis, dysphagia or odynophagia, and nausea or vomiting (47, 43, 35, and 20 percent, respectively). Only 120 of 172 patients (70 percent) treated with this regimen completed all three cycles of cisplatin, although another 40 of the remaining 52 were able to receive two cycles.

In the RTOG 0129 trial, once daily fractionation RT for seven weeks, in combination with three cycles of cisplatin (100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> on days 1, 22, and 43), was compared with accelerated boost RT (42 fractions given over six weeks) with two cycles of cisplatin (100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/m<sup>2</sup></span> on days 1 and 22) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/locally-advanced-squamous-cell-carcinoma-of-the-head-and-neck-approaches-combining-chemotherapy-and-radiation-therapy/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. There was no statistically significant difference in overall survival when patients receiving two cycles of cisplatin with once daily fractionation were compared with those receiving three cycles plus once daily fractionation, although only small number of patients received two cycles. Because this study changed two variables from the standard to the experimental therapy, it is difficult to conclude from the main comparison groups that two cycles are equivalent to three. It may be that the third cycle of cisplatin is needed when a longer course of radiation is used, allowing time for tumor cell repopulation during radiation, and that the shorter accelerated course of radiation may allow deletion of a third cycle. Secondary analysis suggested that patients who only received one cycle of cisplatin rather than two or three did significantly worse: However, these patients tended to be older, have more advanced disease, and a poorer performance status.

Approaches include administering chemotherapy with RT (concurrent chemoradiotherapy), chemotherapy prior to RT (induction chemotherapy), or by combining induction chemotherapy prior to concurrent chemoradiotherapy (sequential therapy). (See <a href=\"#H281026294\" class=\"local\">'Rationale'</a> above and <a href=\"#H281026429\" class=\"local\">'Definitive locoregional therapy alone vs chemotherapy plus definitive locoregional therapy'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Treatment regimens combining chemotherapy and RT for locally advanced head and neck cancer are associated with significant toxicity. Appropriate patient selection is critical to successfully complete therapy. The patient's performance status, comorbidities, age, and psychosocial support network are important factors that need to be considered. (See <a href=\"#H1049946406\" class=\"local\">'Patient selection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with locoregionally advanced head and neck cancer who will be treated with a functional organ preservation approach rather than surgery, we recommend concurrent chemoradiotherapy rather than induction chemotherapy followed by RT alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of induction therapy followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy (sequential chemoradiotherapy) may offer additional advantages over concurrent chemoradiotherapy alone in select situations. Concurrent chemoradiotherapy without induction may be preferable for patients less likely to have distant metastases (N0 and N1 presentations). Sequential therapy may be preferable for select, very good performance status patients with high risk of distant metastases (more extensive lymph node disease including bulky N2b, N2c, and N3) or advanced primary disease (T3 or T4). Induction chemotherapy may provide a long-term survival advantage for larynx cancer patients when compared with concurrent chemoradiotherapy.

This approach significantly improved local control and overall survival compared with PF. It remains unclear, however, if the sequential approach provides a survival advantage over concurrent chemoradiotherapy alone. Decisions should be individualized, but generally, sequential therapy should be reserved for healthy patients with high risk of distant and locoregional failure (especially the combination of bulky N2b, N2C, N3 nodal stage or T3 or greater primary stage).

We recommend once daily fractionation of RT in combination with concurrent chemotherapy rather than a hyperfractionated or accelerated regimen (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). Although alternative RT schedules improve outcomes when administered without concurrent chemotherapy, altered fractionation does not compensate for the lack of concurrent chemotherapy.
