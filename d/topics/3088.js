Ocular misalignment can involve one or both eyes and can occur in any direction; it can be congenital or acquired, latent or manifest, constant or intermittent, and fixed or variable depending upon the position of gaze.

The two medial and two lateral rectus muscles do not contribute significantly to normal vertical ocular alignment and movement.</p><p>The causes of vertical strabismus are reviewed here. The evaluation of strabismus and the causes of horizontal strabismus are discussed separately.

The superior oblique muscle is innervated by cranial nerve IV, the lateral rectus muscle by cranial nerve VI, and all others by cranial nerve III (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F72952\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef72952 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>Understanding strabismus requires knowledge of the two major principles that govern ocular motility [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-vertical-strabismus-in-children/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Agonist muscles in both eyes receive equal innervation to ensure coordinated binocular eye movements.

Tilting the head to the opposite side positions the eyes so that stimulation of the palsied muscle is minimized, resulting in reestablishment of eye alignment, fusion, and binocularity. Torticollis may be the only sign of unilateral trochlear nerve palsy noticed by the parents because affected children rarely complain of diplopia or other visual disturbance.</p><p>Additional signs and symptoms of unilateral trochlear nerve palsy include (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63202\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63202 \">picture 1</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hypertropia of the affected eye in the straight-ahead, or primary, gaze (the superior oblique muscle acts to depress the eye and when it is weak, the muscles that elevate the eye predominate).

Patients who have congenital fourth nerve palsy do not usually require additional evaluation, whereas patients who have acquired fourth nerve palsy may need neuroimaging to detect an underlying process that requires prompt intervention (eg, increased intracranial pressure [ICP], tumors of the brainstem, or intracranial infection). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fourth-cranial-nerve-trochlear-nerve-palsy#H3313885556\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Fourth cranial nerve (trochlear nerve) palsy&quot;, section on 'Causes of isolated fourth nerve palsy'</a>.)</p><p>Clinical features of congenital trochlear nerve palsy include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Torticollis, or head tilt, from an early age, often apparent in old photographs. When an abnormal head posture is compensatory (ie, allows binocular fusion <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> avoids diplopia), it usually resolves or improves with occlusion of either eye.

Surgery may involve tightening of the superior oblique tendon or weakening of the antagonist inferior oblique muscle or other vertically acting extraocular muscles.

Patients with partial oculomotor nerve palsy may have hyperdeviation of the involved eye if the inferior rectus muscle is more involved than are the other extraocular muscles on either eye. However, most patients with oculomotor nerve palsy present with exotropia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> hypotropia along with ipsilateral ptosis.

Causes of hypodeviation include fractures of the orbital floor or wall, thyroid-related ophthalmopathy, Brown syndrome, oculomotor palsy, trochlear nerve palsy (if fixating with the palsied eye), and congenital fibrosis of the extraocular muscles.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Orbital fracture</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Entrapment of the inferior rectus muscle <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> surrounding tissues caused by fractures of the orbital floor results in depression of the involved eye and restriction to elevation of this eye [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-vertical-strabismus-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Fractures of the orbital floor usually are caused by direct blows to the orbit and commonly are called &quot;blowout fractures&quot;. Orbital fractures can also cause hyperdeviations, but much less commonly than they cause hypodeviations.

Diplopia may be present in straight-ahead gaze (primary gaze) or may manifest only when the child looks up or down. In addition, enophthalmos caused by displacement of orbital contents into the maxillary sinus may be present.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical intervention is necessary in patients who have orbital blowout fractures that are associated with strabismus, limited extraocular motility, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> significant enophthalmos. However, unless a clear indication for emergent surgery exists, patients with blowout fractures usually are observed for 7 to 10 days before surgical intervention is performed. The waiting period permits resolution of inflammation and edema, which may result in improvement of duction limitations and strabismus. Many ophthalmologists treat children with oral antibiotics (to cover for sinus flora) and intranasal decongestant sprays during the observation period. They also advise against blowing of the nose. These measures are taken to prevent orbital infection and orbital emphysema by limiting the spread of air and sinus flora into the orbit.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Thyroid-related ophthalmopathy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Thyroid-related ophthalmopathy (or orbitopathy) is a common cause of vertical strabismus in adults but is a rare event in children.

The acute phase is characterized by enlargement of the extraocular muscles caused by lymphocytic infiltration and hydration and commonly results in variable small-angle strabismus and diplopia. Proptosis develops in this phase, which lasts weeks to months. The chronic phase that follows is characterized by worsening proptosis and strabismus caused by further enlargement of the extraocular muscles and eventual fibrosis of the extraocular muscles and surrounding soft tissues. While lid retraction and proptosis are common in children with thyroid orbitopathy, strabismus is uncommon. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-graves-orbitopathy-ophthalmopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of Graves' orbitopathy (ophthalmopathy)&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The inferior rectus and the medial rectus muscles are the extraocular muscles most commonly affected. Thus, most patients with extraocular muscle involvement have hypotropia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> esotropia with limited elevation and abduction. Additional clinical features that are extremely rare in children include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ocular irritation due to dry eye and increased exposure from poor or reduced blinking</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Excessive tearing that often is exacerbated by exposure to cold air, wind, or bright lights</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vague eye or retroorbital discomfort or pain</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Blurring of vision</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Diplopia</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Proptosis</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Loss of vision</p><p/><p>The degree of proptosis (exophthalmos) depends upon the depth of the orbit and the degree of enlargement of the extraocular muscles and orbital fibrous and fatty tissue. The proptosis usually is symmetric but can be asymmetric and may be accompanied by a sensation of pressure behind the eyes. The proptosis may be masked by periorbital edema, which is a common accompaniment. Loss of vision may be caused by corneal exposure from proptosis, poor eyelid closure, or optic neuropathy. Optic neuropathy, the most serious threat to vision, may occur as a result of compression of the optic nerve by the enlarging extraocular muscles and surrounding soft tissues in the orbital apex.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Treatment</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatment of thyroid-related ophthalmopathy is supportive during the acute and evolving chronic phases. Smoking has been associated with more severe disease and patients should be encouraged to stop smoking [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-vertical-strabismus-in-children/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Active or impending optic nerve compression is treated with surgery to decompress the orbit, radiation, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> systemic steroids [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-vertical-strabismus-in-children/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Surgery to correct strabismus can be offered when the ocular alignment has stabilized, although earlier intervention has been advocated for some patients who are severely functionally debilitated by their strabismus early on (eg, with severe anomalous head posture) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-vertical-strabismus-in-children/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].

In this disorder, anomalous interaction between the trochlea and the superior oblique muscle tendon results in restriction of normal movement of the superior oblique tendon through the trochlea [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/causes-of-vertical-strabismus-in-children/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H16\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical features</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Children with Brown syndrome have limited ability to elevate the involved eye, particularly when it is adducted (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F64562\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef64562 \">picture 2</a>). They may complain of discomfort when attempting to elevate the involved eye and may or may not have diplopia in primary (straight-ahead) gaze.</p><p>Brown syndrome may be difficult to diagnose in infants and young children who often do not cooperate with the examination, which requires a specific oblique gaze position (up and in) to detect. As in Duane syndrome and trochlear nerve palsy, torticollis may be the first indication of Brown syndrome. Affected children usually keep their chin up and head tilted toward the unaffected side to maintain single binocular vision. However, if the affected eye is covered, head position may return to normal.

CFEOM1 is an autosomal dominant disorder with a genetic locus that maps to chromosome 12p.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In hyperdeviations, the affected eye is elevated relative to the fellow eye in straight-ahead, or primary, position. Common causes of hyperdeviations in children include trochlear nerve (fourth cranial nerve) palsy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PEDS%2F63202\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef63202 \">picture 1</a>) and oculomotor nerve (third cranial nerve) palsy.
