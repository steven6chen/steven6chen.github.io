The complications with contact lens use are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-contact-lenses\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of contact lenses&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1996690096\"><span class=\"h1\">LENS TYPES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Contact lenses may be categorized by their compositional material, wearing schedule, disposal schedule, permeability, water content, and type of correction (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F104056\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef104056 \">figure 1</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F104057\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef104057 \">figure 2</a>). With many new lens types available, there are alternatives to help most patients achieve comfortable lens wear with clear vision. New types of contact lenses are continually being introduced with the intent to decrease risks of infection, inflammation, and conjunctival trauma while maximizing vision correction and convenience of use [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-contact-lenses/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h2\">Hydrophilic/soft lenses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Soft lenses account for more than 90 percent of prescribed contact lenses in the United States and worldwide (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F104057\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef104057 \">figure 2</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F104056\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef104056 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-contact-lenses/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>].</p><p>Soft lenses are used to correct a variety of refractive errors, including myopia, hyperopia, astigmatism (toric lenses), and presbyopia (multifocal lenses). Not every prescription is available in every material or brand. Certain refractive errors, caused by keratoconus or other corneal distortions, may not be correctable with soft lenses.</p><p>Soft lenses are generally quite comfortable and easier to adapt to than rigid lenses. Patients wearing soft lenses need regular follow-up care and must be compliant with lens care regimens to avoid serious eye problems (see <a href=\"#H785774510\" class=\"local\">'Guidelines for prevention of infectious keratitis'</a> below). Patients who discontinue wearing lenses most commonly complain of lens awareness or dry feeling while wearing lenses. Other reasons include inadequate visual acuity, allergic reactions, and difficulty handling lenses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-contact-lenses/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h3\">Composition</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Soft lenses are made of various plastic polymers that absorb water (hydrophilic). These materials differ in terms of oxygen permeability (expressed in Dk units, where D stands for diffusion and k for solubility), water content (varying between 20 and 70 percent water by weight), surface quality (wettability), ultraviolet absorption, and structural consistency (stiffness or modulus). The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has developed a system for classifying soft lenses (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F52143\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52143 \">table 1</a>).</p><p>All soft lenses absorb water, as well as a variety of other substances: chemicals in contact lens solutions, tear secretions, makeup, and airborne chemicals or vapors. Oily substances from the eyelids or facial creams that come in contact with the lens can coat the lens surface.</p><p>Prior to 1996, the polymer in all soft lenses was primarily 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (HEMA)&ndash;based, which is still used in several current lenses. Polymers with silicone hydrogel (SiHy), which are more highly oxygen permeable, were introduced in 1999 and are now more common in newer types of lenses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-contact-lenses/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Lenses with higher oxygen permeability are generally considered a healthier option [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-contact-lenses/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>], although case control studies did not demonstrate that SiHy lenses decreased the risk of microbial keratitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-contact-lenses/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>] or of nonulcerative contact lens&ndash;related disorders seen in an emergency setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-contact-lenses/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Physical characteristics of different SiHy lenses are detailed in a table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F64969\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef64969 \">table 2</a>). <span class=\"nowrap\">Dk/t</span> is a measure specific to the individual lens, rather than its material, and refers to the oxygen permeability (Dk) of the material normalized for the thickness of the lens (t). The higher the <span class=\"nowrap\">Dk/t</span> value, the more breathable the lens. Patients using higher <span class=\"nowrap\">Dk/t</span> lenses develop less corneal edema during all-day or overnight wear, compared to HEMA-based lenses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-contact-lenses/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Other material characteristics include water content, surface quality (wettability), ultraviolet absorption, and modulus (stiffness). The higher modulus lenses will feel stiffer, and lower modulus lenses floppier, when handled.</p><p>Soft lens materials provide a good medium for microbial growth. Additionally, if patients are not compliant with care techniques, red-eye reactions, discomfort and allergic reactions can occur. Proper disinfection procedures are essential. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Lens care'</a> below.)</p><p>Other sources of eye irritation are lens deposits (chemical or mechanical), foreign bodies trapped under the contact lens, and allergic reactions to preservatives in the care solutions. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-contact-lenses\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of contact lenses&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Length of wear</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The absorption characteristics of soft lenses and their tendency to accumulate surface deposits can affect oxygen permeability and surface quality. Therefore, soft lenses allow only a limited time of safe and healthy usage and should be worn and disposed of on an individually prescribed schedule.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>One day lenses</strong> &ndash; These lenses are designed for one day wear and are dispensed in a large supply (30 or 90 pair). They are ideal for people who want to wear contact lenses intermittently, for those who place convenience as a high priority, and for those who have sensitivity to disinfecting solutions since they do not require use of disinfecting solutions. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Two week disposable</strong> &ndash; These lenses are worn for a maximum of two weeks. Most should be removed each night and cleaned and disinfected, but some have FDA approval for six days and nights of continuous wear.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Monthly disposable</strong> &ndash; Most of these lenses are also worn during the day and removed each night, although some have approval for 30 days of continuous wear.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Quarterly disposable</strong> &ndash; These lenses, designed to be replaced every three months, are generally custom-made lenses for prescriptions for high dioptic power.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Special use soft lenses</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Tinted soft lenses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Soft lenses can be tinted for cosmetic, therapeutic or prosthetic purposes.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cosmetic tints &ndash; Many soft lenses can be made in a variety of colors. The tints may be transparent to enhance natural eye color or can be opaque to dramatically change the color of the iris.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Therapeutic tints &ndash; These special tints are used for highly light-sensitive patients or to enhance color perception in patients with color deficiencies. Though these lenses do not fully compensate for color blindness, they are tinted red and worn to help color-deficient patients identify reds and greens more readily.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Prosthetic tints &ndash; Soft lenses can be tinted or hand-painted to improve cosmesis in patients with scarred corneas or to create an artificial pupil in patients with aniridia, albinism or <span class=\"nowrap\">damaged/distorted</span> pupils.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Bandage lenses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Soft lenses are used as bandage lenses in cases of corneal laceration, corneal exposure injury, and during the healing phase after some ocular surgery such as photorefractive keratectomy (PRK).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Piggyback fitting</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In cases of highly irregular corneal curvature, as in keratoconus, a soft lens is placed on the cornea and a rigid contact lens is placed over it. The soft lens provides a more regular surface for the rigid gas-permeable (RGP) lens to ride upon and also acts to protect the cornea from irritation due to excessive movement of the RGP lens.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">Rigid gas-permeable lenses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Rigid gas-permeable (RGP) contact lenses hold a specific shape although they do have a small amount of flexure. Compared to soft contact lenses, RGP lenses generally provide better visual acuity and are more durable but require longer periods for adaptation. Most wearers can achieve excellent comfort after four to seven days of wear. RGP lenses are generally replaced after two to three years of use.</p><p>Prior to the development of RGP lenses, &quot;hard&quot; lenses were made of a plastic material, polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA). This material provided no oxygen permeability and depended on tear circulation to provide oxygen to the cornea. With the development of RGP lenses, PMMA materials are now rarely used.</p><p>Because of their rigidity, RGP lenses are often used to achieve optimal visual acuity in patients who have not had satisfactory acuity with soft lenses. RGP lenses are also generally better for those who have some degree of &quot;dry eyes.&quot; RGP lenses are also used for overnight corneal reshaping to improve daytime acuity (orthokeratology) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-contact-lenses/abstract/10-12\" class=\"abstract_t\">10-12</a>].</p><p>RGP lenses comprise about 5 to 10 percent of all contact lens fits in the US, including 1 percent for overnight corneal reshaping [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-contact-lenses/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. There are more than 40 different RGP materials used today. As with soft lens materials, each type of RGP lens has unique characteristics in regards to wettability, oxygen transmission, and flexure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-contact-lenses/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Many of these lenses are more gas permeable than soft lenses.</p><p>Most RGP wearers use their lenses during the day. Some lenses are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for one week of continuous wear and at least one brand has approval for 30 days of continuous wear.</p><p>RGP lenses are ordered by the eye care practitioner and made on a custom basis by an RGP lab. Providers can specify various parameters to optimize fit and comfort including diameter, base curve, power, peripheral curves, thickness, edge design, optical zone, as well as material and color.</p><p>Within the last 15 years, computer-guided lathes have been developed that allow manufacture of highly-customized lenses. RGP lenses can be ordered to fit the inter-palpebral opening (7 to 9 mm), the corneal diameter (10.0 to 11.5 mm), the corneoscleral area (12 to 14 mm), or the sclera (15 to 24 mm).</p><p>Custom RGP designs may be the only vision correction option for patients with irregular corneal topography who are not correctable with soft lenses or spectacles. Specialty RGP designs include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Reverse geometry &ndash; steeper curvature peripherally than centrally</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Quadrant specific curves &ndash; different curves in each quadrant of the lens</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Toric/bitoric</span> &ndash; different curves horizontally versus vertically (on front <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> back surface)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aspheric curves &ndash; placed on front or back surface</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multifocal lenses &ndash; eg, aspheric, segmented, concentric</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Corneal reshaping &ndash; reverse geometry lenses of custom or proprietary design to temporarily change the corneal curvature to improve unaided acuity</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H444691125\"><span class=\"h2\">Scleral lenses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Scleral RGP lenses are very large (15 to 24 mm) lenses made to completely vault over the cornea. These lenses are designed to extend beyond the cornea to rest on the sclera, and are comfortable to wear. Because they completely clear the corneal surface, they retain a layer of tears between the lens and the cornea. Scleral lenses are helpful for correcting vision in cases of irregular or distorted corneas, such as keratoconus, post-penetrating Keratoplasty (corneal transplant), post&ndash;refractive surgery or corneal scarring, and for patients with ocular surface disease (severe dry eyes, graft-versus-host disease, Steven-Johnson syndrome, and ocular pemphigoid) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-contact-lenses/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Management and fitting of scleral lenses requires fitters to be specially training to evaluate the unique characteristics and potential complications that can occur with these lenses. In addition, patients wearing scleral lenses require special techniques and solutions for application and removal.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h2\">Hybrid contact lenses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hybrid contact lenses have an RGP central portion fused to a peripheral soft skirt. The first lens of this type (SoftPerm) was made of very low permeability materials and had limited parameters. A newer version of this innovative design <span class=\"nowrap\">(Synergeyes/Duette)</span> is comprised of more permeable materials (both central RGP and peripheral soft) and with various parameters to allow fitting over a large range of unique corneal shapes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-contact-lenses/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. These lenses are worn during the day and disposed of after six months of use.</p><p>The various designs of hybrid lenses can be made to correct for myopia, hyperopia, astigmatism, presbyopia (multifocal design), keratoconus, post-surgical eyes, and other irregular astigmatism cases.</p><p>Advantages of hybrid lenses are excellent acuity, greater comfort compared with RGP lenses, and a wide range of parameters and designs. Disadvantages of hybrid lenses are more difficult application and removal, and higher costs than other lenses.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3571363548\"><span class=\"h2\">Overnight corneal reshaping (OCR)</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Overnight corneal reshaping (OCR) is the process of wearing a specially designed, rigid gas-permeable (RGP) contact lens while asleep to temporarily effect a change in the corneal curvature resulting in clear vision during waking hours without correction. In addition to various specific brand names, this technique is also referred to as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Corneal refractive therapy (CRT)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Overnight corneal reshaping (OCR)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vision shaping treatment (VST)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Orthokeratology (Ortho-K) </p><p/><p>After wearing OCR lenses, the cornea is reshaped via fluid forces exerted under the lens (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F89486\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef89486 \">figure 3</a>). Studies demonstrate the changes affected by OCR are epithelial, not stromal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-contact-lenses/abstract/11,16,17\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,16,17</a>]. It is not a structural &quot;bending&quot; of the cornea, but rather a redistribution and relative <span class=\"nowrap\">thinning/thickening</span> of the epithelial layer. The attached <span class=\"nowrap\">pre/post</span> topography for OCR, demonstrate similarity to post-LASIK topography with central flattening.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1260264522\"><span class=\"h3\">Efficacy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The first approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for corneal refractive therapy (CRT) was granted in 2002 for patients with myopia up to 6.00 D and up to 1.75 D of astigmatism. Patients go through a very short and easy adaptation to the treatment. Most patients report awareness of the lenses while their eyes are open but minimal to no awareness of the lenses while the eyes are closed. Application is similar to traditional rigid gas permeable lenses but removal is usually assisted with a suction device because of the larger diameter (from 10.0 to 11.8 mm).</p><p>Unaided vision improves significantly after the first night of wear. In a crossover study comparing vision-related quality of life (VR-QOL) with OCR versus soft contact lenses worn during the day, approximately 70 percent of the subjects preferred OCR and chose to continue this modality following the study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-contact-lenses/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].<sup> </sup>Another study compared VR-QOL between OCR wearers and subjects who received LASIK and found comparable ratings between the two groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-contact-lenses/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p>OCR has been shown to slow myopic progression [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-contact-lenses/abstract/19-28\" class=\"abstract_t\">19-28</a>]. A study that monitored axial length in children 8 to 16 years of age over a two-year period found that OCR suppressed axial elongation in myopic children, suggesting that this treatment can slow the progression of myopia to a certain extent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-contact-lenses/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3750831807\"><span class=\"h3\">Reversibility and safety</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>An important aspect of OCR is reversibility. If patients elect to discontinue use of OCR lenses for any reason, corneal topography and refraction will return to pretreatment levels within 5 to 10 days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-contact-lenses/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>].</p><p>Serious complications are rare but include microbial keratitis and corneal ulcers in patients using orthokeratology lenses. The overall incidence of microbial keratitis has been reported as 7.7 per 10,000 patient-years of wear [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-contact-lenses/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>]. Case reports, many outside the US, indicate that most adverse events were due to patient <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> prescriber noncompliance, deviation from use of FDA approved products, and the absence of certification training of the respective practitioners. In the US, lens materials must be FDA-approved for overnight wear. the FDA requires certification training for practitioners before the manufacturers can ship the devices to them.</p><p>In a retrospective study of 300 children and adults over a 4.5-year period, there were three minor adverse events that required medical treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-contact-lenses/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]. They involved central epithelial defects from debris being trapped under the lens, and there was no loss of best-corrected visual acuity on follow-up after treatment. The potential for complications is small and can be minimized if 1) patients are compliant with lens care, cleaning and disinfecting procedures, 2) providers and patients are diligent in performing proper follow-up visits, 3) adequate lubricants are used, and 4) lenses are replaced on a regular basis.</p><p>Ongoing study is essential to establish safety, risks, long-term effects, and the efficacy in the retardation of myopia progression.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H922378239\"><span class=\"h3\">Candidates for OCR</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Myopes with less than 6.00 D of spherical correction and less than 1.50 D of astigmatism</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Current contact lens wearers reporting discomfort (dryness and itching)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>LASIK non-candidates</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Children who are progressive myopes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-contact-lenses/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Post-LASIK patients who are under-corrected</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1673133500\"><span class=\"h2\">Multifocal lenses</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Each of the lens types described above is available in multifocal designs in various materials to correct for both distance and near vision needs simultaneously [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-contact-lenses/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4104821081\"><span class=\"h2\">Future developments</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Investigation is ongoing to develop new designs, materials, and applications for contact lenses.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Drug delivery systems &ndash; Lenses impregnated with drugs for slow sustained release are being evaluated for anti-infective, anti- inflammatory, and pressure-lowering indications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-contact-lenses/abstract/17,37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,37,38</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Newer coatings &ndash; Different coatings are under investigation to make lenses more wettable, more resistant to bacterial adhesion and to minimize mucous or protein deposits [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-contact-lenses/abstract/39,40\" class=\"abstract_t\">39,40</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2597045926\"><span class=\"h1\">CONTACT LENS FITTING AND FOLLOW-UP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Contact lens fitting should be done by experienced clinicians who may be optometrists or ophthalmologists.

After resolution of minor irritations, future episodes may be prevented by changing the replacement schedule, reducing wearing time, or a change in the lens type or disinfection regimen.</p><p>Consultation with the eye care provider should be arranged promptly if patients experience blurred vision, pain, or photophobia. More serious conditions associated with contact lenses include corneal ulcers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-contact-lenses/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], corneal abrasions, and infectious keratitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-contact-lenses\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of contact lenses&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Solutions are used to clean and disinfect contact lenses. Reports of serious infections have been related to contaminated lens cases and inadequate patient disinfectant technique [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-contact-lenses/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-fusarium-infection#H773301007\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of Fusarium infection&quot;, section on 'Keratitis'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=free-living-amebas-and-prototheca#H13571795\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Free-living amebas and Prototheca&quot;, section on 'Keratitis'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H785774510\"><span class=\"h2\">Guidelines for prevention of infectious keratitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Following national and international reports of Acanthamoeba keratitis and Fusarium keratitis, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) reviewed proper care of contact lenses. Citing the risk of eye infections and corneal ulcers, with the potential to cause blindness, the FDA has issued recommendations and guidelines for the safe use of contact lenses and associated care products [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-contact-lenses/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>]. These recommendations follow:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Replace your contact lens storage case every three to six months.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Always wash your hands before handling contact lenses to reduce the chance of getting an infection.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Remove the lenses immediately and consult your eye care professional if your eyes become red, irritated, or your vision changes.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Always follow the directions of your eye care professional and all labeling instruction for proper use of contact lenses and lens care products.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use contact lens products and solutions recommended by your eye care professional.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not use contact lens solutions that have gone beyond the expiration or discard date.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rub and rinse your contact lenses as directed by your eye care professional.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clean and disinfect your lenses properly following all labeling instructions provided with your lens care products.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not &quot;top-off&quot; the solutions in your case. Always discard all of the left over contact lens solution after each use. Never reuse any lens solution.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Never use non-sterile water (distilled water, tap water or any homemade saline solution). Exposure of contact lenses to water has been associated with Acanthamoeba keratitis, a corneal infection that is resistant to treatment and cure.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not put your lenses in your mouth to wet them. Saliva is not a sterile solution.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clean, rinse, and air-dry your lens case each time lenses are removed. You may want to flip over your lens case while air drying so excess solution may drain out of the case. Contact lens cases can be a source of bacterial growth.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Do not transfer contact lens solutions into smaller travel size containers. This can affect the sterility of the solution which can lead to an eye infection. Transferring solutions into smaller size containers may also leave consumers open to accidentally using a solution not intended for the eyes.</p><p/><p>A synopsis of these recommendations is presented in a table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F77651\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77651 \">table 3</a>).

MPS are intended to be &quot;all-in-one&quot; solutions that are used to rinse, clean, disinfect, and store lenses during their overnight soaking. Success with MPS depends on patient compliance with directions, particularly in regard to sufficient rinsing or, preferably, using a rub technique to achieve adequate disinfection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/overview-of-contact-lenses/abstract/44,45\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,45</a>]. Individual patient tolerance is variable, and some find that multipurpose solutions provoke an allergic or toxic reaction when exposed to the eye. Available multipurpose solutions in the US are shown in a table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F59505\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59505 \">table 4</a>). Generic versions are also available at various retailers.</p><p>While MPS offer several conveniences compared to other contact lens solutions (ready availability, one bottle, ease for travel) MPS are also more likely to cause allergic or sensitivity reactions, and corneal staining is more prevalent than with peroxide systems.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H19\"><span class=\"h3\">Peroxide systems</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Peroxide systems have gained in popularity over the last few years. They use hydrogen peroxide to disinfect and passively oxidize surface deposits. These systems require that the peroxide solution be &quot;neutralized&quot; prior to lens use, and different techniques (one or two-step) are used for accomplishing this. Commercially available peroxide systems in the US are shown in a table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F59505\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59505 \">table 4</a>).</p><p>Peroxide disinfection, compared to MPS, provides no direct exposure to preservatives and there is a lower likelihood of sensitivity reactions. Lens cleaning is passive, by oxidation, and there is less risk for noncompliance resulting in infection. However, peroxide systems lack the convenience factors of MPS, are more difficult to travel with, and pose the potential for irritation from accidental exposure to non-neutralized solution.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H21\"><span class=\"h2\">Rigid gas-permeable solutions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Solutions to be used with RGP lenses vary in viscosity, wetting agent, and preservatives. One to three bottles contain solutions designed for <span class=\"nowrap\">wetting/conditioning,</span> disinfecting, and cleaning. Available solutions in the US are shown in a table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F59505\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef59505 \">table 4</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22\"><span class=\"h2\">Lubricating drops</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are numerous brands of drops that are designed to be used with contact lenses as lubricants at frequencies varying from once per day to hourly. These may be labeled as &quot;contact lens drops,&quot; <a href=\"topic.htm?path=artificial-tears-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">artificial tears</a>, or lubricating drops. Available lubricants differ in their viscosity and whether or not they are preserved, and individual patient preference and tolerance will determine which is most acceptable. Compatibility with patient's eyes, individual contact lens brand, and other solutions patients use are also factors.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25\"><span class=\"h2\">Application and removal technique</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Application of all types of lenses involves, with clean hands, placing the prepared lens directly on the center of the cornea while holding the lids and lashes to create an opening large enough to clear the diameter of the lens.</p><p>Removal techniques vary with the lens type:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Soft lenses are removed by pinching the edges of the lens at the four and eight o'clock positions with the thumb and index finger while holding the upper lid out of the way. Instilling a drop of wetting solution or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=artificial-tears-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">artificial tears</a> makes removal easier.</p><p/><p>If the lens is not readily removed, it is possible the lens is in the eye but not on center. The most likely place to find the dislocated lens is under the upper lid (usually folded). To check for this, have the patient look straight down while holding the upper lid up as high as possible. If found, the lens can be pinched out from there. It may be necessary to evert the lid to find a lens that has adhered to the inner surface of the upper lid.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rigid gas-permeable lenses can be removed with a rubbery contact lens removal tool (suction cup) or by manipulating the upper and lower lid simultaneously together against the edges of the lens. If an RGP lens is off-center, it is best to try to manipulate the lens position through the closed lids to a position of easy access, usually the temporal sclera, and then use the suction cup device.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hybrid lenses are removed similar to soft lenses, except that the area of pinching must be smaller, at the edge of the soft portion of the lens. Pinch the soft portion with both fingers at the six o'clock position. With this lens, it is critical that the upper lid be held away from the surface of the lens to allow for removal. Again, lubricating drops inserted in the eye can help remove a lens that is not coming out easily.</p><p/><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H27\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contact lenses may be categorized by their compositional material, wearing schedule, disposal schedule, permeability, water content, and type of correction. (See <a href=\"#H1996690096\" class=\"local\">'Lens types'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Soft lenses can be classified by a number of properties, including oxygen permeability, water content, and structural consistency (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F52143\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef52143 \">table 1</a>). Silicon hydrogel lenses, with increased oxygen permeability, are often considered preferable. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Hydrophilic/soft lenses'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Rigid gas-permeable (RGP) contact lenses hold a specific shape although they do have a small amount of flexure. Compared to soft contact lenses, RGP lenses generally provide better visual acuity and are more durable but require longer periods for adaptation. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Rigid gas-permeable lenses'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Overnight corneal reshaping (OCR) involves wearing special lenses overnight to correct spherical and astigmatic refractive error within specified ranges. OCR should be prescribed and monitored by certified practitioners. Ongoing study is essential to establish safety, risks, long-term effects, and the efficacy of OCR to slow or stop myopia progression. (See <a href=\"#H3571363548\" class=\"local\">'Overnight corneal reshaping (OCR)'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Contact lens fitting is performed by optometrists or ophthalmologists, who also provide follow-up evaluation. (See <a href=\"#H2597045926\" class=\"local\">'Contact lens fitting and follow-up'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multipurpose solutions are the most commonly used solutions in the United States to rinse, clean, disinfect, and store lenses during their overnight soaking. Compared to other solutions, multipurpose solutions are more convenient but more likely to cause allergic or sensitivity reactions. As an alternative, peroxide disinfection systems provides no direct exposure to preservatives, though are somewhat less convenient. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Multipurpose solutions'</a> above and <a href=\"#H19\" class=\"local\">'Peroxide systems'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complications of contact lens wear are common. Serious conditions associated with contact lenses include corneal ulcers, corneal abrasions, and infectious keratitis. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Potential complications'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=complications-of-contact-lenses\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Complications of contact lenses&quot;</a>.)<br/><br/>Infection risk can be minimized by following proper procedures for contact lens care. Proper use of contact lenses and hygienic recommendations were issued in a guideline from the US Food and Drug Administration and are summarized in the Table (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PC%2F77651\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef77651 \">table 3</a>).
