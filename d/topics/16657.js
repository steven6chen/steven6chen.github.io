A surgical resection is the only curative treatment modality for localized colon cancer. The goal of surgical resection of primary colon cancer is complete removal of the tumor, the major vascular pedicles, and the lymphatic drainage basin of the affected colonic segment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-primary-colon-cancer/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. En bloc resection of contiguous structures is indicated if there is attachment or infiltration of the tumor into a potentially resectable organ or structure. Patients with symptoms of complicated disease (eg, obstruction, perforation) may require a staged approach to resection.</p><p>Surgical resection may also be indicated in selected patients with limited, potentially resectable metastatic disease (eg, in the liver or lung).

For others, the diagnosis is made because of symptoms such as occult gastrointestinal bleeding or abdominal pain. Regardless, the evaluation typically consists of the following components (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-colorectal-cancer#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging of colorectal cancer&quot;, section on 'Staging'</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A detailed history and physical examination &ndash; Patients suspected of having a hereditary cancer syndrome based on family history should be referred to a genetics counselor for possible genetic testing, the result of which may impact surgical planning.

Synchronous colon cancer has been reported to be present in 4 percent of patients with sporadic colon cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-primary-colon-cancer/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>], and synchronous adenomatous polyps in 30 to 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-primary-colon-cancer/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. If preoperative colonoscopy is not possible due to complicated disease, a full colonoscopy should be performed intraoperatively or postoperatively. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-colorectal-cancer#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging of colorectal cancer&quot;, section on 'Colonoscopy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><span class=\"nowrap\">Chest/abdomen/pelvis</span> computed tomography (CT) scan &ndash; In the United States, the standard practice at most institutions is that all patients with stage II, III, or IV colon cancer undergo staging CT scans of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis prior to or following resection if not possible beforehand, such as in complicated disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-colorectal-cancer#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging of colorectal cancer&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-diagnosis-and-staging-of-colorectal-cancer#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, diagnosis, and staging of colorectal cancer&quot;, section on 'Clinical staging evaluation'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In general, it is preferable to&nbsp;obtain radiographic staging studies preoperatively, as the scan results will occasionally change&nbsp;surgical planning. Most patients with complicated colon cancer that requires emergency surgery (eg, perforation, obstruction) will have undergone CT of at least the abdomen and pelvis as part of their workup. Under these circumstances, there is no immediate need for other workup such as CT of the chest. Once the emergent situation has been resolved, the remainder of the workup can be completed. (See <a href=\"#H149209808\" class=\"local\">'Complicated disease'</a> below.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H149214212\"><span class=\"h1\">CANDIDATES FOR RESECTION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical resection is the only curative treatment modality for localized colon cancer, and it may also be indicated for selected patients with limited, potentially resectable metastatic disease (eg, in the liver or lung).

(See <a href=\"#H48186681\" class=\"local\">'Synchronous metastatic disease'</a> below and <a href=\"#H149209808\" class=\"local\">'Complicated disease'</a> below and <a href=\"#H48188869\" class=\"local\">'Palliative surgery'</a> below.)</p><p>Although several analyses suggested that resection of the primary tumor in the presence of incurable metastasis may slow disease progression and favorably impact survival, the studies are retrospective and potentially biased. Furthermore, these findings are not universal. Thus, until randomized trial results become available (two such studies are ongoing), the standard of care remains nonoperative management for asymptomatic patients with incurable metastatic colon cancer. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=locoregional-methods-for-management-and-palliation-in-patients-who-present-with-stage-iv-colorectal-cancer#H91702448\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Locoregional methods for management and palliation in patients who present with stage IV colorectal cancer&quot;, section on 'Potential survival benefit of palliative resection'</a>.) </p><p>Increasing age may be accompanied by higher rates of medical comorbidity. Some patients may not be appropriate candidates for resection due to medical comorbidities.

These goals can be achieved using an open or laparoscopic approach, but the specific clinical situation (eg, elective versus emergent colectomy) often dictates the approach. However, the same principles of resection that apply to open surgery for resecting colon cancer must also apply to the laparoscopic approach. (See <a href=\"#H125358035\" class=\"local\">'Resection margins'</a> below and <a href=\"#H125358042\" class=\"local\">'Regional lymphadenectomy'</a> below.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H454566128\"><span class=\"h2\">Open versus laparoscopic colectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Meta-analyses of randomized trials (the largest trial and two of the meta-analyses are described below) demonstrate faster recovery with no detrimental impact on recurrence or survival for laparoscopic compared with open colectomy for the treatment of colon cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-primary-colon-cancer/abstract/6-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">6-15</a>]. Thus, when a surgeon experienced with advanced laparoscopic colectomy techniques is available, we recommend laparoscopic-assisted colectomy rather than open colectomy for patients with uncomplicated localized colon cancers who have not had prior extensive abdominal surgery. For complicated colon cancers, an open approach is frequently necessary. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the largest trial, the United States Intergroup Clinical Outcomes of Surgical Therapy (COST) trial, 872 patients with colonic adenocarcinoma were randomly assigned to open or laparoscopic colectomy by credentialed surgeons who each performed at least 20 laparoscopic resections and underwent videotape analysis of their technique before enrolling patients in the study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-primary-colon-cancer/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>]. Operative time was significantly longer in the laparoscopic group (150 versus 95 minutes), and 21 percent of laparoscopic cases required conversion to an open procedure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-primary-colon-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. On the other hand, the laparoscopic group had modestly but significantly shorter durations of hospital stay (five versus six days) and parenteral analgesic use (three versus four days). There were no significant differences in intraoperative or postoperative complications, perioperative mortality rates, readmission or reoperation rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-primary-colon-cancer/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>], or rates of surgical wound recurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-primary-colon-cancer/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. At a median follow-up of seven years, there were no significant differences in the five-year disease-free survival (69 versus 68 percent in the laparoscopic and open colectomy groups, respectively) or overall survival (76 versus 75 percent). </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Long-term outcomes from laparoscopic versus open colon resection have been addressed in two meta-analyses of randomized trials, most of which enrolled exclusively or predominantly patients with colon cancer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-primary-colon-cancer/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. One analyzed results from seven published randomized trials, while the other focused upon four trials with the endpoint of survival that enrolled more than 150 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-primary-colon-cancer/abstract/9-12,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-12,16</a>]. Both concluded that laparoscopic colectomy provides oncologic outcomes, including number of lymph nodes harvested, disease recurrence, and overall survival, that are comparable to those achieved with an open approach. In the larger of the two meta-analyses (n = 1536), three-year disease-free survival rates for laparoscopic versus open colectomy were 75.8 and 75.3 percent, respectively (95% CI of the difference, -5 to 4 percent); three-year overall survival rates were also similar (82.2 versus 83.5 percent; 95% CI -3 to 5 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-primary-colon-cancer/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Of the seven trials reporting this outcome, only 3 of 826 patients randomized to laparoscopic surgery developed an incisional recurrence, compared with 1 of 801 patients undergoing open surgery [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-primary-colon-cancer/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition, patients who undergo laparoscopic colectomy for node-positive cancer may be more likely to initiate adjuvant chemotherapy. In a study of 12,849 patients who underwent colectomy for stage III colon cancer, adjuvant chemotherapy was given more frequently to patients receiving the laparoscopic approach as compared with open colectomy (72 percent versus 67 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-primary-colon-cancer/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Adjuvant chemotherapy is typically initiated only after recovery from surgery; laparoscopy may be associated with a decrease in complications and therefore a faster postoperative recovery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-therapy-for-resected-stage-iii-node-positive-colon-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant therapy for resected stage III (node-positive) colon cancer&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p>Techniques for open and laparoscopic colon resection are reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-colon-resection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of colon resection&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=right-and-extended-right-colectomy-open-technique\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Right and extended right colectomy: Open technique&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=left-colectomy-open-technique\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Left colectomy: Open technique&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H125358035\"><span class=\"h2\">Resection margins</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Proximal and distal resection margins should be at least 5 to 7 cm from the tumor [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-primary-colon-cancer/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. These margins should allow for an adequate resection of the appropriate segment of the bowel with its vascular supply and associated lymphatics. For patients undergoing right hemicolectomy, the length of ileum resected does not influence local recurrence rates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-primary-colon-cancer/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H125358679\" class=\"local\">'Cecum or right colon'</a> below.) </p><p>Radial margin positivity is rare with colon cancer resections. A retrospective study of 984 patients who underwent colon cancer resections identified 52 patients (5.3 percent) with an involved radial margin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-primary-colon-cancer/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. A positive radial margin conferred both a worse overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] 3.39, 95% CI 2.41-4.77) and a worse disease-specific survival (HR 2.03, 95% CI 1.43-2.89). In addition, in a subgroup analysis of the 16 patients who had no baseline metastasis at presentation, a positive radial margin was associated with a significantly increased risk of distant disease recurrence (38 versus 13 percent) as well as a nonstatistically significant increase in local recurrences (6.3 versus 1.3 percent). The subgroup analysis needs to be interpreted with caution due to the small number of patients and events. </p><p>Thus, patients who are suspected of having a positive radial margin either preoperatively or intraoperatively should undergo extended surgery including en bloc resection of adjacent organs to achieve a negative margin. (See <a href=\"#H125358938\" class=\"local\">'Locally advanced cancer'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H125358042\"><span class=\"h2\">Regional lymphadenectomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Regional lymphadenectomy provides prognostic information and guides postoperative management, such as chemotherapy administration. </p><p>The tumor-bearing colon should be removed en bloc with the associated mesentery to the origin of the named primary feeding vessel without any defect in the mesentery. Such a resection will include the regional mesenteric lymph nodes along the course of major mesenteric vessels and along the vascular arcades (intermediate and central nodes) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F58219\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58219 \">figure 1</a>), as well as those adjacent to the colon along its mesocolic border (pericolonic nodes) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-primary-colon-cancer/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The extent of such a regional lymphadenectomy is sometimes referred to as a D2 excision, particularly in the Japanese literature. An example of this type of resection is given in the figure (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=SURG%2F53859%7ESURG%2F65664\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53859 graphicRef65664 \">figure 2A-B</a>) and contrasted with the resection used for benign disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-colon-resection#H644995072\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of colon resection&quot;, section on 'Benign versus malignant disease'</a>.)</p><p>Some surgeons perform an extended lymphadenectomy beyond the primary feeding vessel and associated central lymph node basin; such practice is variably referred to in the literature as &quot;high ligation,&quot; &quot;central vascular ligation,&quot; &quot;complete mesocolic excision,&quot; or &quot;D3 excision.&quot; As an example, in a retrospective study from a national database of patients with stage I to III colon cancer, those who underwent complete mesocolic excision in one hospital had better four-year disease-free survival compared with those who underwent colon resection with conventional lymphadenectomy at three other hospitals. However, the five-year overall survival was not different between the groups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-primary-colon-cancer/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p>However, routine performance of extended lymphadenectomy beyond the primary feeding vessel and associated central lymph node basin without any clinical justification (eg, clinically positive nodes) is not the standard of care. Metastasis to central lymph nodes occurs in 1 to 8 percent of patients with colon cancer and is most commonly seen with T3 or T4 tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-primary-colon-cancer/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. Metastasis to central lymph nodes but not more peripheral nodes (ie, &quot;skip metastasis&quot;) occurs in less than 2 percent of cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-primary-colon-cancer/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. </p><p>There is a direct correlation between the number of lymph nodes evaluated per patient after surgical resection and survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-primary-colon-cancer/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. Examination of fewer than 12 lymph nodes is a high-risk feature for stage II colon cancer, which increases the risk of recurrence to that of stage IIIA disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-primary-colon-cancer/abstract/27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">27,28</a>]. As such, consensus guidelines recommend that at least 12 lymph nodes be assessed for adequate staging [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-primary-colon-cancer/abstract/18,29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,29-31</a>]. Adjuvant chemotherapy may be offered to those who have fewer than 12 lymph nodes examined, even if they have no demonstrable metastatic disease in the examined nodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-primary-colon-cancer/abstract/32,33\" class=\"abstract_t\">32,33</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-chemotherapy-for-resected-stage-ii-colon-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant chemotherapy for resected stage II colon cancer&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H149213033\"><span class=\"h3\">Role of sentinel node mapping</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The sentinel lymph node (SLN) concept is based upon the observation that tumor cells migrating from a primary tumor metastasize to one or a few lymph nodes (LNs) before involving other LNs. Injection of vital blue dye <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> radiolabeled colloid around the area of the tumor permits identification of an SLN in the majority of patients, and its status accurately predicts the status of the remaining regional LNs. The concept of SLN biopsy as a less morbid alternative to complete regional lymph node dissection has gained traction in patients with breast cancer and melanoma, but its utility for other tumor types has yet to be demonstrated. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-sentinel-lymph-node-biopsy-in-breast-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of sentinel lymph node biopsy in breast cancer&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-treatment-of-regional-lymph-nodes-in-melanoma#H8\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and treatment of regional lymph nodes in melanoma&quot;, section on 'Sentinel lymph node biopsy'</a>.) </p><p>SLN mapping is not considered a standard approach to nodal staging in colon cancer and does not replace standard lymphadenectomy. A meta-analysis and a systematic review reported that SLN mapping for colon cancer had a sensitivity of 78 to 93 percent and a false negative rate of 4 percent (range 0 to 15 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-primary-colon-cancer/abstract/34,35\" class=\"abstract_t\">34,35</a>]. </p><p>When LNs retrieved by SLN mapping are studied by immunohistochemistry <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> molecular techniques (&quot;ultra-staging&quot;), upstaging was reported in 11 to 29 percent of patients with otherwise node-negative colon cancer (by standard hematoxylin and eosin [H&amp;E] staining) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-primary-colon-cancer/abstract/36-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">36-38</a>]. However, there is uncertainty surrounding the prognostic significance of these micrometastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-primary-colon-cancer/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The newest 2017 (eighth edition) revision of the Tumor, Node, Metastasis (TNM) staging classification defines micrometastases of 0.2 to 2 mm as N1 disease, and those &lt;0.2 mm (including isolated tumor cells) as N0(i+) disease. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathology-and-prognostic-determinants-of-colorectal-cancer#H672792512\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathology and prognostic determinants of colorectal cancer&quot;, section on 'Nodal micrometastases'</a>.) </p><p>The Cancer and Leukemia Group B 80001 trial examined both sentinel and nonsentinel lymph nodes of colon cancer by standard histopathology and immunohistochemistry. By either criterion, examination of the sentinel nodes alone failed to accurately predict the presence of either conventionally defined nodal metastases or micrometastases in the nodal basin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-primary-colon-cancer/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H149209539\"><span class=\"h1\">COLON RESECTION</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H149213832\"><span class=\"h2\">Carcinoma in a polyp</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The majority of colorectal cancers arise from polyps (adenomas). The malignant potential of an adenoma depends on its size, histology, and degree of dysplasia. It is believed that the transformation from normal mucosa to adenoma, dysplasia, and then to invasive cancer takes many years.

However, resection or primary anastomosis may not be possible in all clinical settings because of extensive local disease involving adjacent structures, or serious comorbid illnesses. In these situations, a diverting end colostomy with creation of a mucous fistula is the procedure of choice, especially in patients with distal colonic tumors. The mucous fistula decompresses the secretions from the distally obstructed segment of bowel. An end colostomy rather than a loop colostomy is preferred because it is easier to manage with fewer complications.

However, if the patient has a competent ileocecal valve, there is potential for distention of the bypassed segment and eventual closed loop obstruction due to the accumulation of secretions in the bypassed colon. In these cases, the cecum can be tacked to the abdominal wall with seromuscular sutures, and surgical clips can be placed in the abdominal wall to mark the area where a potential percutaneous drain can be placed at a later time if necessary.</p><p>Regardless of the method of surgical palliation, the laparoscopic approach to colorectal resection is preferred to minimize the risk of postoperative complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-primary-colon-cancer/abstract/82\" class=\"abstract_t\">82</a>]. While there are no data from randomized trials or prospective studies regarding the optimal approach (open versus laparoscopic) for surgical palliation, we believe the data from trials of colectomy for colon resection for colorectal cancer in the nonpalliative setting are directly applicable here.

Curative intent is defined as histologically negative margins of resection and no evidence of synchronous unresectable distant disease. </p><p>Locoregional recurrences are classified into four categories: anastomotic, <span class=\"nowrap\">mesenteric/nodal,</span> retroperitoneal, and peritoneal [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-primary-colon-cancer/abstract/86\" class=\"abstract_t\">86</a>].

Because of its greater sensitivity for distant metastatic disease, a positron emission tomography (PET) scan is indicated if staging CT scans are negative [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-primary-colon-cancer/abstract/87\" class=\"abstract_t\">87</a>].

Approximately 30 percent of patients with isolated recurrent locoregional colon cancer will qualify and derive long-term benefit from aggressive surgical resection of the recurrent disease. The most important prognostic factor is the ability to achieve an R0 resection (microscopic negative margins). In a systematic review, patients who underwent an R0 resection had a three-year overall survival of 58 percent (95% CI 39 to 76 percent) and five-year overall survival of 52 percent (95% CI 32 to 72 percent). By contrast, the five-year survival for patients who underwent R1 resection (microscopic positive margins) and R2 resection (macroscopic positive margins) was 11 and 0 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/surgical-resection-of-primary-colon-cancer/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>].

Surgical resection is the only curative treatment modality for localized colon cancer. The goal of surgical resection is complete removal of the tumor, the major vascular pedicles, and the lymphatic drainage basin of the affected colonic segment. (See <a href=\"#H125357644\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above and <a href=\"#H149214212\" class=\"local\">'Candidates for resection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preoperative evaluation for patients diagnosed with colon cancer typically includes history and physical examination, baseline serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level, <span class=\"nowrap\">chest/abdomen/pelvis</span> computed tomography (CT) scan, and colonoscopy.

Endoscopic management (eg, polypectomy) is sufficient for pedunculated or sessile malignant polyps that can be removed in one piece and have none of the high-risk features. Polyps with high-risk features require radical resection because of an increased incidence of residual cancer <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> lymphatic spread. (See <a href=\"#H149213832\" class=\"local\">'Carcinoma in a polyp'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-primary-colon-cancer#H17949127\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of primary colon cancer&quot;, section on 'Management of carcinoma in a polyp'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with uncomplicated localized colon cancers who have not had prior extensive abdominal surgery, we recommend laparoscopic-assisted colectomy rather than open colectomy (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). In experienced hands, appropriately selected patients have comparable oncologic outcomes, perioperative morbidity and mortality, and faster recovery with laparoscopic as compared with open surgery. (See <a href=\"#H454566128\" class=\"local\">'Open versus laparoscopic colectomy'</a> above.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Regardless of whether a laparoscopic or open colectomy is performed, the tumor-bearing colon should be removed with a proximal and a distal margin of at least 5 to 7 cm. The colonic segment should be removed en bloc with the associated mesentery to the origin of the named primary feeding vessel without any defect in the mesentery. The surgical specimen should contain at least 12 lymph nodes. If fewer than 12 lymph nodes are identified in the resected specimen, adjuvant chemotherapy may be required even without demonstrable metastatic disease in the examined nodes. (See <a href=\"#H125358035\" class=\"local\">'Resection margins'</a> above and <a href=\"#H125358042\" class=\"local\">'Regional lymphadenectomy'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=adjuvant-chemotherapy-for-resected-stage-ii-colon-cancer\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Adjuvant chemotherapy for resected stage II colon cancer&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with locally advanced (eg, T4) tumors that involve contiguous organs or structures, we perform an en bloc multivisceral resection as needed to obtain negative resection margins of the involved structures. The plane of adherence between the colonic tumor and the adjacent organ(s) should not be disrupted because a substantial portion of these adhesions are malignant and transection of tumor could further impair prognosis. (See <a href=\"#H125358938\" class=\"local\">'Locally advanced cancer'</a> above and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-management-of-primary-colon-cancer#H17949004\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the management of primary colon cancer&quot;, section on 'Locally advanced primary lesions'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with complications related to a resectable primary tumor (eg, bleeding, perforation, or obstruction), the decision to proceed with surgery needs to be individualized depending on the presenting symptoms and signs as well as the medical condition of the patient.
