DM2 is caused by an expansion of a CCTG tetranucleotide repeat located in intron 1 of the ZNF9 (CNBP) gene. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Myotonic dystrophy: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Genetics'</a>.)</p><p>The diagnosis of myotonic dystrophy can usually be made clinically in a patient with the characteristic presentation and a positive family history. Genetic testing for an expanded CTG repeat in the DMPK gene is the gold standard for confirming the diagnosis of DM1. Testing for the CCTG repeat in the ZNF9 (CNBP) gene is appropriate if DM1 testing is negative.

However, the age of onset, presentation, and severity and progression of symptoms vary according to DM phenotype. There are congenital, childhood, classic (adult-onset), and mild forms of DM1, whereas only an adult onset form of DM2 is recognized. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H1951197145\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Myotonic dystrophy: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Phenotypes'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H2630427080\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Myotonic dystrophy: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Clinical features'</a>.)</p><p>Certain aspects of management differ according to phenotype, as outlined in the sections that follow.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2624714493\"><span class=\"h2\">Congenital DM1</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infants with congenital myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) often present with respiratory and feeding difficulties and may require neonatal intensive care and ventilatory support. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H423148898\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Myotonic dystrophy: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Congenital DM1'</a>.)</p><p>Respiratory involvement is the leading cause of death in the neonatal period. Need for support longer than four weeks usually indicates a poor prognosis for survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/1,2\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,2</a>]. Nasal continuous positive airway pressure (N-CPAP) can facilitate weaning infants with DM1 from endotracheal mechanical ventilation and minimize morbidity associated with prolonged intubation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Because feeding difficulties are common during the first two years of life, children with congenital DM1 are at increased risk for aspiration and may benefit from feeding evaluation. Gastrostomy tube insertion is often necessary during the first six months of life to maintain nutrition and prevent aspiration pneumonia.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3512475463\"><span class=\"h2\">Childhood DM1</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The childhood (juvenile) form of DM1 typically presents before the age of 10 years with cognitive and behavioral problems. Over time, affected children develop muscle symptoms and disability that is similar to severe adult-onset classic DM1. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H3074915823\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Myotonic dystrophy: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Childhood DM1'</a>.)</p><p>Cognitive and psychosocial assessments are important aspects of management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Special education, psychotherapy, social support, and vocational skills training can help to improve function, although there are no high-quality trials evaluating these approaches. In some cases, pharmacotherapy for issues such as attention deficit disorder, anxiety, or mood disorders may be beneficial.</p><p>Management of childhood DM1 is otherwise similar to that of classic (adult-onset) DM1, including routine surveillance for and treatment of the multiple neurologic and systemic manifestations, such as progressive muscle weakness, cardiac abnormalities, dysphagia, respiratory involvement, and sleep disorders (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F101401\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101401 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1495153568\"><span class=\"h2\">Classic DM1</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The classic form of DM1 becomes symptomatic during the second to fourth decade of life. Major clinical manifestations include (but are not limited to) skeletal and respiratory muscle weakness, myotonia, cataracts, cardiac arrhythmias, and excessive daytime sleepiness. Multidisciplinary surveillance and management of these and other issues is optimal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F101401\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101401 \">table 1</a>); specific issues are outlined below. (See <a href=\"#H3382880566\" class=\"local\">'Specific management issues'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H768194175\"><span class=\"h2\">Mild DM1</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The mild form of DM1 is characterized by mild weakness, myotonia, and cataracts. Onset is usually after age 40 years. Though generally not debilitating, surveillance for cataracts and potentially serious manifestations of DM1, such as cardiac conduction abnormalities, is advisable.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H716164758\"><span class=\"h2\">DM2</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The onset of DM2 ranges from the second to the seventh decades, and the condition often presents with myotonia, weakness, or cataracts. In most cases, proximal muscle weakness predominates, particularly involving the hip girdle muscles. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H1273747966\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Myotonic dystrophy: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'DM2'</a>.)</p><p>Although DM2 generally is less severe than classic DM1, it can progress to disability and is associated with an increased risk of cardiac conduction disease and other serious complications. Therefore, management is similar to that of classic DM1 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F101401\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101401 \">table 1</a>). </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3382880566\"><span class=\"h1\">SPECIFIC MANAGEMENT ISSUES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no disease-modifying therapy available for the treatment of myotonic dystrophy. Thus, treatment is symptomatic. The systemic (non-neuromuscular) manifestations of myotonic dystrophy are the most treatable aspects of the disease. A number of tests and evaluations are useful in the surveillance and management of patients with DM1 and DM2 (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F101401\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101401 \">table 1</a>). Because the disease is multifaceted and variable, its management requires an interdisciplinary approach among health professionals, and involves many different skills and services from community resources [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>Recommendations regarding management are based more on consensus and clinical experience than on evidence from randomized controlled trials.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Muscle involvement</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The natural history of DM1 is that of gradual progression in weakness. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H5\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Myotonic dystrophy: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Skeletal muscle weakness'</a>.)</p><p>The management of physical disability depends on the distribution and severity of muscle weakness and is best provided by a multidisciplinary team including neurologists, physiatrists, and occupational and physical therapists.</p><p>Initially, molded ankle-foot orthoses are helpful in preventing foot-drop and enhancing gait stability. Over time, patients may find that a walker is necessary to navigate distances with confidence and safety, and in the later stages of the illness, a wheelchair may be required, especially for longer distances outside of the home. Accordingly, the sequential and often combined use of ankle-foot orthoses, walkers, and wheelchairs in concert with multidisciplinary interventions (addressing the compromised vision, fatigue, and visuospatial deficits of patients with DM1) are important in maintaining health and safety in these patients.</p><p>Neck muscle weakness is common in DM1, affecting both flexor and extensor groups, and tends to cause head-drop; this symptom may be ameliorated by a fitted collar. Eye lid crutches or blepharoplasty may be helpful for troublesome ptosis encountered in DM1.</p><p>In DM2, progression and severity of weakness are less pronounced that in DM1. When necessary, the assistive devices described for DM1 are likely to be helpful.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Exercise training</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Moderate-intensity strength training for myotonic dystrophy (DM1) has been assessed in only a few small randomized trials [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. There was no clear evidence of benefit or harm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>A smaller study on the effects of aerobic training in 12 patients with DM1 for 12 weeks on a cycle ergometer noted that patients increased maximal oxygen uptake by 14 percent, and increased maximal workload by 11 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. However 5 of 17 patients who were originally enrolled dropped out of the study because of low compliance and 3 of the 12 who completed the study did not follow the original training schedule. Thus, such approaches to fitness are likely to be most appropriate for a relatively small subset of patients with DM1 who exercise under supervision.</p><p>In the absence of evidence that exercise is effective for improving muscle strength, we suggest that patients with myotonic dystrophy engage in low intensity exercise, to the extent that they are capable and without undue physical stress. We also suggest that exercise include gentle stretching actions at selected joints, such as dorsiflexion at the ankles, extension at the knees, and abduction at the hips, which may attenuate the tendency for tendon shortening and joint contractures. This recommendation is based upon the intuitive sense that stretching and exercise may be systemically beneficial, and upon evidence that low intensity exercise is not harmful.</p><p>Since exercise can precipitate serious arrhythmias, some have suggested exercise testing with electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring as part of the routine evaluation of young patients with myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. We suggest exercise testing with ECG monitoring prior to beginning an exercise training program in patients with cardiac symptoms or an abnormal baseline ECG. In this group of patients, a decision regarding the safety of exercise training should be made by a cardiologist.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1368179436\"><span class=\"h3\">Muscle pain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In DM2, muscle pain can be a persistent and troubling symptom. Muscle pain may also affect some patients with DM1. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Myotonic dystrophy: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Muscle pain'</a>.)</p><p>Pharmacologic agents that may be effective for this problem include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gabapentin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">gabapentin</a>, tricyclic antidepressants, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mexiletine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mexiletine</a>, and low-dose glucocorticoids, such as oral <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prednisone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">prednisone</a> 5 mg on alternate days [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. We begin management with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ibuprofen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ibuprofen</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=naproxen-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">naproxen</a> as needed, along with gabapentin up to 300 mg three times per day.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1164134765\"><span class=\"h3\">Myotonia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Symptoms of myotonia in patients with DM1 can be sufficiently pronounced to prompt treatment. Myotonic symptoms in DM2 are less likely to require therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Myotonic dystrophy: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Muscle pain'</a>.)</p><p>For adults with myotonic symptoms that require treatment (typically in DM1), we suggest initial therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mexiletine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mexiletine</a> 450 mg daily in three divided doses. In children and adolescents, in whom myotonia may occasionally need to be treated, mexiletine (1.5 to 3.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> every 8 to 12 hours) may be used with careful follow-up. Because of the rare pro-arrhythmic effects of mexiletine in those with underlying ventricular arrhythmias, it is best to obtain a cardiology consultation before beginning therapy with mexiletine, particularly for patients with DM1 who have current or remote cardiac symptoms or for those with an abnormal baseline ECG [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Mexiletine is contraindicated in instances of second and third degree heart block. Ataxia, coordination abnormalities, and dizziness are relatively common side effects, and ongoing hematologic, liver function, and cardiac monitoring must be performed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=major-side-effects-of-class-i-antiarrhythmic-drugs\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Major side effects of class I antiarrhythmic drugs&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The clinical experience of treating myotonia has involved a variety of medications, including <a href=\"topic.htm?path=phenytoin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">phenytoin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mexiletine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mexiletine</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procainamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">procainamide</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propafenone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">propafenone</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=flecainide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">flecainide</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=carbamazepine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">carbamazepine</a>, all of which are sodium channel blockers and share the potential to increase weakness while reducing myotonia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. However, there are few high-quality data:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In two small, seven-week, double-blind, randomized controlled trials involving patients with DM1, treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mexiletine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mexiletine</a> (at either 450 mg or 600 mg daily, both given in three divided doses) was superior to placebo for improvement in grip relaxation time [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. Mexiletine was well-tolerated in these trials and was not associated with any serious adverse effects or cardiac conduction abnormalities.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An earlier systematic review published in 2006 found 10 small randomized controlled trials that evaluated the effectiveness of 12 different treatments for myotonia in patients with myotonic dystrophy and other myotonic disorders [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, the quality of the trials was generally poor, and a meta-analysis was not possible.</p><p/><p>Historically, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=quinine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">quinine</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=procainamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">procainamide</a> were used to treat myotonia, but their use is no longer recommended because they exhibit adverse effects on cardiac conduction, to which patients with DM may be especially vulnerable.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H633369788\"><span class=\"h2\">Cardiac disturbances</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Cardiac conduction disturbances and tachyarrhythmias occur in DM1, and to a lesser extent in DM2. In some instances, cardiac arrhythmias may occur as a very early manifestation of the disease. These issues are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Myotonic dystrophy: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Cardiac abnormalities'</a>.)</p><p>In accord with 2017 guidelines from the American Heart Association (AHA), we recommend a careful cardiac history (seeking evidence for palpitations, blackouts, syncope, and dyspnea), examination (ascertainment for bradyarrhythmia, ectopic beats, mitral valve prolapse, and atrial fibrillation), ECG, echocardiography, and ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring at the time of DM diagnosis, regardless of symptoms (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F101401\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101401 \">table 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Patients with a normal left ventricular ejection fraction should be reevaluated yearly by examination, ECG, and ambulatory electrocardiographic monitoring, and every two to four years by echocardiography. Patients with palpitations, dizziness, syncope, non-sinus rhythm, PR interval &gt;240 ms, QRS duration &gt;120 ms, or second- or third-degree atrioventricular block should be evaluated at least annually and considered for invasive electrophysiology study in anticipation of possible pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) placement.</p><p>We typically refer our patients to a cardiologist for ongoing care and follow-up in parallel with neurology clinic visits.</p><p>The indications for pacemaker placement remain controversial, primarily because available data are limited. One of the largest studies was a retrospective analysis of 486 adults from the DM1 Heart Registry who had a PR interval &gt;200 msec or a QRS duration &gt;100 msec or both [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. The study compared 341 patients who were treated with an invasive strategy (electrophysiologic study and permanent pacemaker if the HV interval was &gt;70 msec) with 145 patients who had noninvasive management. In the unadjusted analysis, there was a trend toward longer nine-year survival in the invasive compared with the noninvasive group (77 versus 70 percent), but the difference was not statistically significant (hazard ratio [HR] 0.74, 95% CI 0.47-1.16). However, in several different analyses that adjusted for between-group differences in baseline characteristics, the longer survival associated with the invasive strategy was statistically significant, with adjusted HRs ranging from 0.47 (95% CI 0.26-0.84) to 0.61 (95% CI 0.38-0.99). This finding was mainly due to a significantly lower incidence of sudden death associated with the invasive strategy.</p><p>Guidelines from the AHA note that it is reasonable to consider ICD placement in select patients with neuromuscular disease, particularly those in which arrhythmia may be a predominant feature (including DM1), after thoughtful discussion and decision making, which should be individualized and based on the overall medical status and options for management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=permanent-cardiac-pacing-overview-of-devices-and-indications#H23\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Permanent cardiac pacing: Overview of devices and indications&quot;, section on 'Neuromuscular diseases'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Respiratory function and sleep</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Respiratory complications and sleep-related breathing abnormalities are common in DM1 but are less frequent and severe in DM2. These problems are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=myotonic-dystrophy-etiology-clinical-features-and-diagnosis#H12\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Myotonic dystrophy: Etiology, clinical features, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Respiratory function'</a>.)</p><p>Accordingly, an important aspect of respiratory management in DM1 is to gauge effectiveness of gas exchange by clinical signs (comfort level, respiratory rate, oxygen saturation, auscultation for air entry into the lung bases) and observation for and evidence of diaphragmatic paralysis and pneumonia.</p><p>In adults with DM1, we often follow up the clinical assessment by obtaining forced vital capacity (FVC) measurements (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F101401\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101401 \">table 1</a>), and use the values of serial FVC results in concert with clinical findings to follow respiratory status. In the absence of data upon which to base specific recommendations, we suggest that FVC be measured annually in asymptomatic adult subjects but more regularly in those with dyspnea or previously documented reduction in FVC.</p><p>In patients demonstrated to have alveolar hypoventilation, regular use of incentive spirometry and a cough assist device may help to counteract the tendency for atelectasis and hypercarbia and reduce the risk of pneumonia.</p><p>Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) may coexist with central hypoventilation, especially in those at highest risk due to coexisting obesity. The hypersomnia of DM1 may be aggravated by alveolar hypoventilation and the sleep apnea syndrome but is not entirely reversed by continuous positive airway pressure management [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Thus, it is critical to assess the quality of sleep in patients with DM1, probing for whether there is nocturnal restlessness, unexplained awakenings, and loud snoring punctuated by occasional awakenings and gasping for breath, all of which should suggest the presence of a sleep-related respiratory disorder and lead to further study with a polysomnographic evaluation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F101401\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101401 \">table 1</a>) that will reveal a more specific diagnosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Patients with DM who have sleep apnea may present with only daytime sleepiness and occasionally orthopnea, perhaps due to diaphragm weakness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/19,20\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,20</a>]. Some patients can have central apneas and may benefit from adaptive servo-ventilation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=central-sleep-apnea-treatment#H615714305\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Central sleep apnea: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Patients with hypoventilation-related CSA'</a>.) </p><p>Noninvasive positive airway pressure ventilation (NIPPV) may be helpful in correcting sleep apnea, improving hypoventilation, and assisting diaphragm weakness. Bilevel positive airway pressure ventilation (BiPAP) is better tolerated by patients with weakness of the chest wall and diaphragm who cannot overcome expiratory forces. NIPPV may also be used symptomatically during the day to rest weak respiratory muscles and to improve dyspnea. In rare instances, the progressive loss of respiratory drive and the increasing severity of diaphragm and chest wall muscle weakness creates a situation in which NIPPV no longer provides adequate respiratory support and tracheostomy may be considered.</p><p>Children with childhood (juvenile) myotonic dystrophy may not be able to cooperate for reliable pulmonary function testing. However, most adolescent patients can be tested, and a baseline FVC and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) measurement is suggested for adolescent patients. Periodic testing is not needed for most pediatric patients with DM1, but we suggest annual or biannual pulmonary tests in adolescents with dyspnea or reduced baseline FVC <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> FEV1 values.

Using age-matched general population mortality rates as a comparator, the standardized mortality ratio (a ratio of observed to expected deaths) for those with myotonic dystrophy was significantly increased to 7.3 (95% CI 5.8-9.1).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In another longitudinal study of 408 patients with DM1 who were followed for a mean of 5.7 years, there were 81 deaths (20 percent), and the mean age at death was 54 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. The most common cause of death, affecting 32 of 81 patients (40 percent), was progressive neuromuscular respiratory failure. Twenty-seven patients (33 percent) died suddenly. Independent risk factors for sudden death were severe conduction system abnormality on baseline ECG (relative risk [RR] 3.3, 95% CI 1.24-8.78) and a clinical diagnosis of atrial tachyarrhythmia (RR 5.18, 95% CI 2.28-11.77). Independent risk factors for death from progressive neuromuscular respiratory failure were patient age, severe proximal muscle weakness, heart failure, and atrial tachyarrhythmia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac conduction disturbances can progress rapidly and are associated with mortality in DM. In a cohort of 30 patients with DM1 who were followed over a 17-year period, the baseline ECG sum of the PR interval plus QRS duration of &ge;320 msec was the best predictor of mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. All survivors had a PR plus QRS time of &lt;320 msec. However, among the 15 patients who died, the cause was respiratory in 10 and cardiac in 3. In another study of 70 patients with DM1, independent positive predictors of PR and QRS prolongation during long-term follow-up were paroxysmal atrial flutter or fibrillation, older age and larger CTG repeat expansions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/myotonic-dystrophy-treatment-and-prognosis/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p/><p>A separate issue that contributes to reduced life expectancy and increased morbidity is a tendency for medical care to be fragmented or deficient for DM1 patients and families.

The age of onset, presentation, and severity and progression of symptoms vary according to DM phenotype. No disease-modifying therapy is available, and treatment is symptomatic. (See <a href=\"#H3404313784\" class=\"local\">'Management and DM phenotype'</a> above and <a href=\"#H3382880566\" class=\"local\">'Specific management issues'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Depending to some degree upon the phenotype, most patients with DM1 and DM2 may need cardiac evaluations for arrhythmia and cardiomyopathy, forced vital capacity for respiratory muscle weakness, polysomnography for sleep disorders, ophthalmologic examination for cataracts, swallowing assessment for dysphagia, cognitive and psychosocial assessments for intellectual, attentional, and psychiatric disorders, and endocrine testing for diabetes and hypothyroidism (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F101401\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef101401 \">table 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Infants with congenital DM1 often present with respiratory and feeding difficulties and may require neonatal intensive care and ventilatory support. Neonates and children with congenital DM1 are at increased risk for aspiration and may require a feeding evaluation and gastrostomy tube feeding. (See <a href=\"#H2624714493\" class=\"local\">'Congenital DM1'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The childhood (juvenile) form of DM1 typically presents with cognitive and behavioral problems. Cognitive and psychosocial assessments and interventions are important aspects of management, which is otherwise similar to that of classic DM1. (See <a href=\"#H3512475463\" class=\"local\">'Childhood DM1'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>In the classic (adult-onset) form of DM1, clinical manifestations include (but are not limited to) skeletal and respiratory muscle weakness, myotonia, cataracts, cardiac arrhythmias, and excessive daytime sleepiness. Multidisciplinary management is optimal. (See <a href=\"#H1495153568\" class=\"local\">'Classic DM1'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The mild form of DM1 is generally not debilitating, but surveillance for cataracts and potentially serious manifestations of DM1, such as cardiac conduction abnormalities, is advisable. (See <a href=\"#H768194175\" class=\"local\">'Mild DM1'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>DM2 generally is less severe than classic DM1 but can progress to disability and is associated with an increased risk of cardiac conduction disease and other serious complications. Management is similar to that of classic DM1. (See <a href=\"#H716164758\" class=\"local\">'DM2'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Management of physical disability may involve the use of assistive devices. For adolescent and adult patients with DM1 and adults with DM2 who are able to participate, have a normal ECG, and are free from cardiac symptoms, we suggest low-intensity exercise training as tolerated and without undue physical stress (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For patients with cardiac symptoms or an abnormal baseline ECG, we suggest exercise testing with ECG monitoring prior to beginning an exercise training program, since exercise can trigger arrhythmias. In this group of patients, a decision regarding the safety of exercise training should be made by a cardiologist. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Muscle involvement'</a> above and <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Exercise training'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For occasional adult patients who have severe myotonia that interferes with function, we suggest initial therapy with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=mexiletine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">mexiletine</a> 450 or 600 mg daily in three divided doses (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). For children with severe myotonia, we suggest oral mexiletine 1.5 to 3.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/kg</span> every 8 to 12 hours (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Adults and children should have a cardiology evaluation for risk assessment before starting treatment with mexiletine. (See <a href=\"#H1164134765\" class=\"local\">'Myotonia'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For adult patients with DM1 and severe excessive daytime sleepiness, we suggest a trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=modafinil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">modafinil</a> (200 mg twice daily) (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H1421521960\" class=\"local\">'Excessive daytime sleepiness'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Average life expectancy is reduced for patients with congenital DM1, childhood DM1, and classic (adult onset) DM1, whereas average life expectancy is probably normal or near normal for patients with DM2. (See <a href=\"#H74335015\" class=\"local\">'Life expectancy'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li class=\"breakAll\">Harper PS.
