The WHO had targeted allergic rhinitis because of its impact on asthma and mirrors the consensus asthma guidelines.</p><p>Other commonly used terms are &quot;seasonal,&quot; which is allergic rhinitis that occurs at a particular time of the year (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F74234\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74234 \">figure 1</a>) and &quot;perennial,&quot; which describes symptoms to allergens that are present year-round [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-rhinitis-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. This system of classification is preferred by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).</p><p>Patients whose symptoms occur episodically are often more aware of the disability caused by allergic rhinitis, whereas patients with chronic symptoms often adapt to significant impairment over time and may not seek medical care until symptoms become severe [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-rhinitis-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/41,42,49,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">41,42,49,50</a>].

Depending upon the geographic area, pollination periods for certain types of plants are well known (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F74234\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef74234 \">figure 1</a>). Colloquial names sometimes correctly identify the triggering pollen (eg, cedar fever), although in other cases, a plant that is not causing symptoms but is very visible at the same time is implicated by the name (eg, rose fever, which refers to allergic rhinitis caused by grasses that pollinate at the same time that roses bloom or hayfever, which occurs in the fall when hay is being gathered, but is caused by weed pollens or from mold growing in the hay). Symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis are predictable and reproducible from year to year.</p><p>Perennial allergic rhinitis usually reflects allergy to indoor allergens like dust mites, cockroaches, mold spores, or animal dander, although aeroallergens may cause perennial rhinitis in tropical or subtropical climates. Perennial rhinitis due to outdoor allergens is common in subtropical regions with long pollinating seasons and ubiquitous mold and dust mite allergens. Perennial symptoms are also seen with occupational allergen exposure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-rhinitis-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=occupational-rhinitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Occupational rhinitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It is important to understand that allergic rhinitis, whether seasonal or perennial, may be difficult to distinguish clinically from the nonallergic forms of rhinitis, since not all seasonal and perennial symptoms are unique to allergic forms of rhinitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-rhinitis-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>]. As an example, chronic nonallergic rhinitis can be triggered by changes in weather and temperature and may appear to have a seasonal pattern in some patients. Thus, for an accurate diagnosis of allergic rhinitis, diagnostic testing may be required. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Allergen-specific testing'</a> below and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-nonallergic-rhinitis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic nonallergic rhinitis&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7950557\"><span class=\"h3\">Increasing sensitivity over time</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>When a patient is continually exposed to an allergen, persistent nasal mucosal inflammation develops. In such patients, symptoms of rhinitis occur on exposure to lower doses of allergen (priming) and to nonspecific irritants (hyper-reactivity). Clinically, this results in continued and frequently more severe rhinitis symptoms with exposure to low allergen concentrations. This phenomenon of increasing sensitivity over time probably results from a lowering of the threshold for a clinical response. Sequential allergen challenges in patients with allergic rhinitis result in more symptoms and higher levels of histamine and inflammatory cells in nasal washes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-rhinitis-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. Presumably, the induced inflammation recruits additional inflammatory cells and their products into the process, producing increasing symptoms.</p><p>Concomitant with allergen priming, the nose becomes progressively more sensitive to cholinomimetic stimuli, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methacholine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methacholine</a> and histamine, as well as irritant stimuli like cold air [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-rhinitis-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Over time, many patients with allergic rhinitis report heightened sensitivity to irritants (eg, tobacco smoke, particulate pollution), volatile substances, and strong scents and perfumes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-rhinitis-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7950204\"><span class=\"h2\">Physical findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The following physical findings may be present in patients with active allergic rhinitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-rhinitis-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Infraorbital edema and darkening due to subcutaneous venodilation, findings that are sometimes referred to as &quot;allergic shiners&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Accentuated lines or folds below the lower lids (Dennie-Morgan lines), which suggests concomitant allergic conjunctivitis (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=allergic-conjunctivitis-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Allergic conjunctivitis: Clinical manifestations and diagnosis&quot;</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A transverse nasal crease caused by repeated rubbing and pushing the tip of the nose up with the hand (the &quot;allergic salute&quot;)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>&quot;Allergic facies,&quot; which are typically seen in children with early-onset allergic rhinitis, consist of a highly arched palate, open mouth due to mouth breathing, and dental malocclusion (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F66393\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66393 \">picture 1</a>)</p><p/><p>The internal structures of the nose, oropharynx, and ears should be examined:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The nasal mucosa of patients with active allergic rhinitis frequently has a pale bluish hue or pallor along with turbinate edema</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clear rhinorrhea may be visible anteriorly, or if the nasal passages are obstructed, rhinorrhea may be visible dripping down the posterior pharynx</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperplastic lymphoid tissue lining the posterior pharynx, which resembles cobblestones (a finding called &quot;cobblestoning&quot;)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tympanic membranes may retract or serous fluid may accumulate behind tympanic membranes in patients with significant nasal mucosal swelling and eustachian tube dysfunction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-rhinitis-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>]</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7950282\"><span class=\"h2\">Routine laboratory findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Routine laboratories are usually normal.

(See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p>Sensitization to aeroallergens generally precedes the appearance of rhinitis symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-rhinitis-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. Sensitization describes the presence of allergen-specific IgE as measured by skin testing or in vitro tests. However, sensitization is not synonymous with allergy, and a person can be sensitized to an allergen without developing symptoms when exposed to that allergen. Only a subset of sensitized individuals demonstrate clinical allergy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-rhinitis-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/60\" class=\"abstract_t\">60</a>]. The distinction between sensitization and clinical allergy is discussed in more detail elsewhere.

In a study of approximately 600 children, at least two seasons of pollen exposure were required before most children developed allergic symptoms [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-rhinitis-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/61\" class=\"abstract_t\">61</a>].</p><p>After the age of two, the prevalence of allergic rhinitis steadily increases, demonstrating a bimodal peak in the early school and early adult years. In a prospective study of 2024 children, the prevalence of allergic rhinitis increased from 5 percent at the age of four years to 14 percent at age eight years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-rhinitis-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/59\" class=\"abstract_t\">59</a>]. The prevalence then gradually increases, peaking in early adulthood. The condition is usually persistent throughout adulthood, with some improvement in older age [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-rhinitis-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/18,22,62-68\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,22,62-68</a>].</p><p>Allergic rhinitis uncommonly presents for the first time in older adults, unless there is a significant change in exposures (eg, a new pet or a move to a different climate). Thus, in an older adult with new nasal symptoms, other causes of rhinitis should be considered. A change in response to treatment in older adults may indicate the development of vasomotor or atrophic rhinitis.

However, purulent sinusitis without concurrent rhinitis is rare, given that these tissues are anatomically contiguous [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-rhinitis-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/70\" class=\"abstract_t\">70</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Symptoms of bacterial sinusitis include nasal congestion, purulent rhinorrhea or postnasal drip, facial or dental pain, and cough.

In these settings, the diagnosis is clinical and is supported by negative skin tests or improved symptoms upon resolution or treatment of the causative condition. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-hypothyroidism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of hypothyroidism&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-physiologic-respiratory-changes-and-dyspnea#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maternal adaptations to pregnancy: Physiologic respiratory changes and dyspnea&quot;, section on 'Respiratory changes'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Unilateral rhinitis or nasal polyps</strong> &ndash; Unilateral rhinitis or nasal polyps are uncommon in uncomplicated allergic rhinitis. Unilateral rhinitis suggests the possibility of nasal obstruction by a foreign body, tumor, or polyp, and the presence of nasal polyps suggests nonallergic rhinitis with eosinophilia syndrome (NARES), chronic bacterial sinusitis, allergic fungal sinusitis, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> hypersensitivity, cystic fibrosis, or primary ciliary dyskinesia (immotile cilia syndrome). Fiberoptic rhinoscopy may be helpful in this setting. Increasing evidence also suggests that the histology of those with rhinitis with or without nasal polyps are different, with eosinophils or neutrophils predominating in those with or without polyps, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/allergic-rhinitis-clinical-manifestations-epidemiology-and-diagnosis/abstract/91\" class=\"abstract_t\">91</a>]. However, allergic rhinosinusitis and NARES are both conditions characterized by nasal eosinophilia, but most patients with these conditions lack nasal polyps.

These include granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener's) and relapsing polychondritis:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The most common presenting symptoms of granulomatosis with polyangiitis include persistent rhinorrhea, <span class=\"nowrap\">purulent/bloody</span> nasal discharge, oral <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> nasal ulcers, polyarthralgias, myalgias, or sinus pain.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>With relapsing polychondritis, symptoms of stuffiness, crusting, rhinorrhea, and on occasion, epistaxis, may accompany nasal cartilage inflammation, which can also compromise olfaction. Cartilage destruction associated with sustained or recurrent episodes of inflammation can result in a characteristic saddle-nose deformity.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\">Such disorders may therefore present with nasal symptoms, without evidence of systemic disease. These disorders are diagnosed based upon the combination of characteristic histologic and clinical findings.

More insidious effects of the disorder include fatigue, irritability, reduced performance at school and work, and depression. (See <a href=\"#H896753\" class=\"local\">'Introduction and terminology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H897856\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Allergic rhinitis affects 10 to 30 percent of children and adults in the United States. The prevalence is increasing in industrialized countries worldwide, particularly in urban areas. Although frequently underdiagnosed and undertreated, allergic rhinitis imposes a significant economic burden as a result of reduced school performance and work productivity, clinician visits, expense of over-the-counter and prescription medications, and cost of treating related conditions, such as sinusitis and asthma. (See <a href=\"#H897169\" class=\"local\">'Epidemiology'</a> above and <a href=\"#H897892\" class=\"local\">'Associated conditions'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Allergic rhinitis may be classified by temporal pattern (intermittent or persistent) and by severity (mild or moderate-severe) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F85849\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef85849 \">table 1</a>). (See <a href=\"#H7949595\" class=\"local\">'Patterns of symptoms'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of allergic rhinitis is made clinically, based upon a suggestive history (including presence of risk factors), characteristic symptoms and signs on physical examination, and (if indicated) the confirmed presence of allergen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE). Symptoms should also be reproducible (by history) upon exposure to allergens to which the patient is sensitized. (See <a href=\"#H2\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Identification of the specific allergens to which the patient is sensitive is not necessary for successful treatment in many cases. However, patients whose symptoms are severe or refractory to therapy should be referred to an allergy specialist for a more definitive evaluation. Properly performed skin testing is the best method for determining allergic sensitization. (See <a href=\"#H5\" class=\"local\">'Allergen-specific testing'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The differential diagnosis of allergic rhinitis includes acute and chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS), chronic nonallergic rhinitis, rhinitis medicamentosa, atrophic rhinitis, and rhinitis due to systemic medications.
