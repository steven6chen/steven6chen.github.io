It is characterized by systemic activation of blood coagulation, which results in generation and deposition of fibrin and formation of microvascular thrombi in the small blood vessels throughout the body, eventually leading to multiple organ dysfunction. Because widespread clotting depletes the platelets and clotting factors that are needed to control bleeding, excessive bleeding often occurs.</p><p>Any patient with DIC presents a major management challenge, and this challenge is further complicated when the patient is carrying a viable fetus. For example, delaying delivery to transfuse a pregnant woman with DIC who is bleeding heavily may not be in the best interest of a fetus with a category III fetal heart rate tracing, whereas performing an emergency cesarean delivery on a pregnant woman with DIC may not be in her best interest. Even in the setting of fetal demise, labor and delivery of a pregnant woman with DIC carries the potential for catastrophic hemorrhage.</p><p>This topic will focus upon DIC related to pregnancy. Broader discussions of the pathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment of DIC can be found separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of disseminated intravascular coagulation in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Other causes of pregnancy-associated thrombocytopenia and obstetrical hemorrhage are also presented separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thrombocytopenia-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thrombocytopenia in pregnancy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-the-etiology-and-evaluation-of-vaginal-bleeding-in-pregnant-women\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of the etiology and evaluation of vaginal bleeding in pregnant women&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H817239223\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOPHYSIOLOGY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Normal pregnancy is a prothrombotic state [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-during-pregnancy/abstract/1-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-11</a>]. Compared with nonpregnant women, pregnant women have a marked increase in some coagulation factors, impaired endogenous anticoagulation, reduced fibrinolysis, and increased platelet reactivity. The shift in the balance between the hemostatic and fibrinolytic systems serves to prevent excessive hemorrhage during placental separation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=maternal-adaptations-to-pregnancy-hematologic-changes\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Maternal adaptations to pregnancy: Hematologic changes&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Placental tissue (decidual cells) strongly expresses tissue factor, an integral membrane glycoprotein that is mostly functionally inactive under normal conditions. However, at sites of vascular endothelial disruption, placental trauma (eg, abruption), or fetoplacental necrosis (eg, retained fetal demise), tissue factor becomes activated and serves as the cofactor for the production of activated factor VII (VIIa) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-during-pregnancy/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>]. The tissue factor-factor VIIa complex, in turn, activates factor X (producing factor Xa), which binds to its cofactor (factor Va) to generate thrombin, which then cleaves fibrinogen to produce fibrin, the major structural component of the clot (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F90873\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef90873 \">figure 1</a>). To counterbalance these procoagulant changes, the fibrinolytic system, mediated by plasmin, cleaves fibrin to prevent excessive fibrin accumulation (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F81428\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef81428 \">figure 2</a>). The natural anticoagulants proteins C, S, and Z (synthesized in the liver) and a specific tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI-2, synthesized by the normal trophoblast) also act to prevent uncontrolled activation of clotting (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F111299\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef111299 \">figure 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-during-pregnancy/abstract/14-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">14-17</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-hemostasis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of hemostasis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>DIC occurs when this balance fails. Widespread activation of the clotting cascade results in intravascular fibrin deposition, fibrinolysis, depletion of coagulation factors and platelets, production of fibrin degradation products and D-dimers (both of which can interfere with platelet function and uterine contractility), and depletion of natural anticoagulants (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F98047\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef98047 \">figure 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-during-pregnancy/abstract/18-20\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-20</a>]. This combination of effects can result in uncontrolled hemorrhage, microvascular thrombosis, and multiorgan failure.

This has major implications for management in that the primary cause should always be sought and treated. </p><p>Additional pregnancy complications may exacerbate DIC <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> worsen hemostatic defects, although the exact mechanism(s) are unclear. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Preeclampsia, eclampsia, and the <strong>h</strong>emolysis, <strong>e</strong>levated <strong>l</strong>iver function tests, and <strong>l</strong>ow <strong>p</strong>latelets (HELLP) syndrome may contribute to endothelial cell damage.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute fatty liver may impair hepatic production of coagulation factors and clearance of fibrin degradation products.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Shock may reduce tissue perfusion, in turn reducing natural clearance of anticoagulants, and impairing pH and temperature of the tissues.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemorrhage alone does not cause DIC; however, severe tissue hypoxia in the setting of shock has been proposed to result in <span class=\"nowrap\">exposure/release</span> of tissue factor <span class=\"nowrap\">on/from</span> damaged cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-during-pregnancy/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>].</p><p/><p>In the setting of infection or inflammation, an interaction between DIC and systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) also has been described, and SIRS appears to play a role in the pathogenesis of DIC in sepsis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-during-pregnancy/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. In some cases, leukocytes may also play a role in the activation and propagation of DIC. In these cases, the SIRS-associated increases in circulating proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin-1 (IL-1), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) can lead to exaggerated expression of tissue factor by leukocytes and endothelial cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-during-pregnancy/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. This may generate an uncontrolled coagulation response that could eventually deteriorate into DIC.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H194036533\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of DIC in pregnancy ranges from 0.03 to 0.35 percent in population-based studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-during-pregnancy/abstract/24-26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24-26</a>], or 12.5 per 10,000 delivery hospitalizations (0.13 percent) in one study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-during-pregnancy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>].</p><p>Although the overall prevalence of DIC is low in pregnancy, the frequency of DIC in women with specific pregnancy complications can be quite high. As an example, an evidence-based review noted that coagulopathy was reported in 22 to 83 percent of cases of amniotic fluid embolism in large series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-during-pregnancy/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. In a series of 442 pregnancies complicated by hemolysis, elevated liver function tests, and low platelets (HELLP) syndrome, 92 had DIC (21 percent); the majority were associated with abruptio placentae [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-during-pregnancy/abstract/28,29\" class=\"abstract_t\">28,29</a>].</p><p>Pregnancy-associated DIC accounts for approximately 1 to 5 percent of all cases of DIC in high-resource countries; the proportion of DIC cases attributable to pregnancy complications is higher in low-resource countries [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-during-pregnancy/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1949821\"><span class=\"h1\">UNDERLYING CAUSES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Identification of the underlying cause of DIC is critical to management.

Parturition and the postpartum period are associated with the release of tissue factor into the maternal circulation after separation of the placenta, which can induce substantial activation of coagulation and generation of thrombin [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-during-pregnancy/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. Women with PPH due to atony, large lacerations, or a morbidly adherent placenta are believed to have a supraphysiologic activation of the coagulation cascade and must be considered at risk for DIC. The counter argument is that coagulopathy in the setting of PPH is simply due to depletion of clotting factors and platelets by blood loss; in the absence of transfusion, this results in dilutional coagulopathy. Further research in this area is needed.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4261532594\"><span class=\"h2\">Other causes</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In addition to the pregnancy-related causes listed above (see <a href=\"#H3098585458\" class=\"local\">'Pregnancy-related causes'</a> above), DIC may be caused by other conditions that may occur in the nonpregnant population. The most common events that initiate DIC in the general population are sepsis, trauma, and cancer (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=HEME%2F58104\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58104 \">table 1</a>). The possibility of these nonobstetric causes of DIC should be considered in pregnant women with DIC, especially when an obvious pregnancy-associated cause is absent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-during-pregnancy/abstract/35,36\" class=\"abstract_t\">35,36</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H1949821\" class=\"local\">'Underlying causes'</a> above.)</p><p>Patients may present with severe uterine bleeding <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> diffuse oozing of blood from skin (eg, at intravenous sites) or mucosa (eg, from a bladder catheter). Pregnancy-related hepatic disease can result in hepatic rupture and intra-abdominal bleeding. Substantial uterine bleeding may not be appreciated initially if most of the blood is retained in utero behind the placenta (eg, &quot;concealed abruption&quot;). Signs of shock (eg, tachycardia, hypotension, weak peripheral pulses, altered mental status, cool extremities, narrow pulse pressure [&lt;25 mmHg]) <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> organ dysfunction may be present (eg, acute renal failure, hepatic dysfunction, acute lung injury, neurologic dysfunction).

Pregnant women who have been involved in trauma can lose large amounts of blood into the soft tissues (eg, fractured femur with bleeding into the thigh), which can cause DIC. </p><p>DIC can also be a chronic process with no symptoms, but this is rare in pregnancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-diagnosis-and-treatment-of-disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-in-adults#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of disseminated intravascular coagulation in adults&quot;, section on 'Acute versus chronic DIC'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H194036965\"><span class=\"h2\">Laboratory findings</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is no single laboratory test that is sensitive and specific for DIC. Laboratory findings generally include prolongation of coagulation times and thrombocytopenia. These findings need to be interpreted within the context of normal reference values in pregnancy (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F89013\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89013 \">table 2</a>), which are sometimes different from values in nonpregnant women (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=normal-reference-ranges-for-laboratory-values-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Normal reference ranges for laboratory values in pregnancy&quot;</a>).</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Thrombocytopenia</strong> &ndash; The platelet count is typically mildly to moderately reduced in DIC, but platelet counts below <span class=\"nowrap\">20,000/microL</span> are uncommon [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-during-pregnancy/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In normal pregnancy, the mean platelet count is slightly lower than in nonpregnant women, but it usually remains within the normal range. Because platelet counts may be within the normal range in the early stages of DIC, the trend in platelet count should be monitored when DIC is suspected. In a clinical scenario that includes DIC in the differential diagnosis, a falling platelet count may be a sign of developing DIC even if the absolute count is in the normal range.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Thrombocytopenia in pregnancy is not specific for DIC; it is observed in several pregnancy-related disorders. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=thrombocytopenia-in-pregnancy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Thrombocytopenia in pregnancy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Prolongation of the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and prothrombin time (PT)</strong> &ndash; The aPTT and PT are prolonged in DIC; the international normalized ratio (INR) for the PT is also increased. In a normal gestation, the aPTT and <span class=\"nowrap\">PT/INR</span> may be slightly lower than that in nonpregnant women due to normal changes in coagulation factors. This can cause a delay in the recognition of ongoing coagulopathy since prolongation in the aPTT and PT may not become obvious until the causative pathology is well advanced [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-during-pregnancy/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. Thus, it is essential to note any prolongation of the aPTT and <span class=\"nowrap\">PT/INR,</span> even if the starting point is within the normal range and the current aPTT and <span class=\"nowrap\">PT/INR</span> are still within that normal range. A widening differential between baseline and repeat tests in either the aPTT or the <span class=\"nowrap\">PT/INR</span> may be indicative of clinical worsening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-during-pregnancy/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The thrombin time (TT) is another coagulation test that measures the final step in the coagulation cascade (conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin). The TT is not typically measured in pregnancy or DIC, but if measured, it tends to follow the same pattern as the aPTT and PT (ie, it is shorter than normal in normal pregnancy and prolonged in DIC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-during-pregnancy/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Hypofibrinogenemia</strong> &ndash; Fibrinogen levels fall in DIC.

Reduction in the fibrinogen level from the woman's baseline is concerning even if the absolute level remains in the normal range, as the fall in fibrinogen in DIC can be a relatively late finding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-during-pregnancy/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">The greatest concern for bleeding generally occurs when the fibrinogen level is &lt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL;</span> this is also the typical level below which the aPTT and PT become prolonged. In a study of patients with persistent uterine atony, a fibrinogen level &lt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> had a positive predictive value of 100 percent for progression to severe PPH, whereas a level &gt;400 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> had a negative predictive value of 79 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-during-pregnancy/abstract/43\" class=\"abstract_t\">43</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Increased D-dimer</strong> &ndash; D-dimer is increased in DIC.

One method is to determine the clotting time of 5 mL of blood in a red top tube (ie, no additives) at room temperature; if the blood in the tube clots within 8 to 10 minutes and the clot remains intact, the patient likely has adequate fibrinogen stores. If the blood in the tube does not clot or an initial clot dissolves, it is likely that the patient is markedly deficient in key clotting factors.</p><p>Although serial coagulation testing is rarely necessary to diagnose DIC in the obstetric setting (where DIC is typically fulminant), serial laboratory assessments over a few hours in less fulminant cases may show progressively prolonged coagulation times, decreasing platelet counts, increasing values for D-dimer , and falling fibrinogen levels. In challenging cases, this pattern can help distinguish mild DIC from normal pregnancy-related changes in these laboratory values.</p><p>Serial testing of the CBC, fibrinogen level, and coagulation times are important for guiding management (eg, coagulation factor replacement).

We make the diagnosis of acute DIC in a pregnant woman when the clinical setting is appropriate (eg, abruptio placentae, amniotic fluid embolism, acute fatty liver, sepsis) and there is laboratory evidence of thrombocytopenia, coagulation factor consumption (eg, prolonged prothrombin time [PT], activated partial thromboplastin time [aPTT]; low fibrinogen), and fibrinolysis (eg, increasing D-dimer), as long as another etiology for these findings does not become apparent. Early involvement of the consulting hematology specialist is advised to evaluate the likelihood of DIC and eliminate other possibly life-threatening causes of the findings, such as thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). (See <a href=\"#H194037429\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H194037363\"><span class=\"h2\">Scoring systems</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>We do not use scoring systems for diagnosis of DIC. As no single diagnostic test can accurately confirm or reject a diagnosis of DIC, composite scoring systems have been developed and are sometimes used in research studies for the diagnosis of DIC in nonpregnant individuals. However, their utility in pregnancy is unknown as neither of the following two systems has been validated in pregnant women. An important caveat for any DIC scoring system is that these systems are only intended to be used in the appropriate clinical setting (eg, in a patient with an underlying condition known to cause DIC).

In some cases, these conditions may coexist with DIC or contribute to the pathogenesis of DIC. Treatment of the underlying cause typically leads to resolution of DIC (see <a href=\"#H1562749477\" class=\"local\">'Identify and address the triggering event'</a> below):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Postpartum hemorrhage with dilutional coagulopathy</strong> &ndash; Severe bleeding from postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) may result in dilutional coagulopathy. Like DIC, there may be reduced levels of coagulation factors that can prolong the PT and aPTT. There may be a mixed picture with elements of coagulation factor consumption in PPH. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=overview-of-postpartum-hemorrhage#H100822618\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Overview of postpartum hemorrhage&quot;, section on 'Clinical presentation and diagnosis'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Primary thrombotic microangiopathy</strong> &ndash; Primary thrombotic microangiopathies such as thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) are rare during pregnancy; however, the physiologic stress of pregnancy may elicit an underlying inherited or acquired condition. Like DIC, patients may have Coombs negative hemolytic anemia with schistocytes on the blood smear, thrombocytopenia, and organ damage. In contrast to DIC, in TTP the coagulation studies typically are normal and the ADAMTS13 (A disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin-like repeats-13) activity is severely reduced (eg, activity &lt;10 percent). Mild decreases in ADAMTS13 activity (eg, between 10 and 60 percent) are often seen in acutely ill pregnant women (eg, preeclampsia, HELLP [hemolysis, elevated liver function tests, and low platelets] syndrome) and are not thought to be pathophysiologically or clinically significant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-during-pregnancy/abstract/51\" class=\"abstract_t\">51</a>].

Further, pregnancy is generally well tolerated in most cases of VWD, partly due to the physiologic increases in von Willebrand factor (VWF) levels. However, VWF levels may decline precipitously in the postpartum period, and it is possible for a woman who has not had a prior hemostatic challenge to have marked postpartum bleeding as the initial manifestation of VWD. Like DIC, some types of severe VWD may be associated with thrombocytopenia <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> prolongation of the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). Unlike DIC, VWD does not cause prolongation of the prothrombin time (PT), a low fibrinogen level, or elevated D-dimer; and patients with VWD will have low levels of VWF, VWF activity (ristocetin cofactor activity), and possibly factor VIII.

Like DIC, patients can have thrombosis and elevated D-dimer, and the aPTT is frequently prolonged. Unlike DIC, in APS the PT and fibrinogen levels are normal and bleeding typically does not occur. Furthermore, the autoantibodies in APS cause prolongation of the aPTT as a laboratory artifact; they are actually prothrombotic.

Like DIC, patients with PE may present with shock and elevated D-dimer. Unlike DIC, PE generally is not associated with bleeding, prolongation of the clotting times, or low fibrinogen.

HIT is extremely rare in pregnancy. Like DIC, HIT can present with thrombocytopenia, thrombosis, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> organ damage; and bleeding may be present due to the heparin. Unlike DIC, HIT has a temporal relationship to heparin exposure; patients with HIT have positive testing for HIT antibodies and do not have coagulation abnormalities (except for those due to their anticoagulant).

In the obstetric setting, most patients are intrapartum and have severe uterine bleeding. Resuscitation aims to achieve euvolemia, normalize tissue oxygen delivery, and resolve acidosis and coagulopathy by appropriate fluid therapy and transfusion (using near-equal amounts of packed red blood cells [RBCs], plasma, and platelets), warming the patient and providing appropriate airway and ventilatory management. Multiple techniques for controlling uterine bleeding are available after the fetus has been delivered. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postpartum-hemorrhage-medical-and-minimally-invasive-management\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postpartum hemorrhage: Medical and minimally invasive management&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postpartum-hemorrhage-management-approaches-requiring-laparotomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postpartum hemorrhage: Management approaches requiring laparotomy&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The management of the undelivered, bleeding, pregnant woman with DIC is described below.

Placement of an epidural and other spinal anesthesia techniques are generally contraindicated in patients with DIC because of the risk of spinal epidural hematoma.

A massive transfusion or large volume obstetric transfusion protocol should be initiated if indicated and available (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F53516\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef53516 \">table 3</a> and <a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F91236\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef91236 \">algorithm 1</a>).

(See <a href=\"#H3873014456\" class=\"local\">'Maintain oxygenation and perfusion'</a> below.)</p><p>The best approach to fluid resuscitation remains controversial. The trauma literature favors the use of blood and blood products as the initial volume expander in cases of massive hemorrhage. The rationale is that large volumes of crystalloid will dilute whatever RBCs, platelets, and coagulation factors are present and potentially worsen bleeding in a patient who is in the process of becoming coagulopathic. Thus, in a situation of severe PPH with ongoing bleeding, the transfusion of type O, Rh(D)-negative uncrossmatched blood along with platelets and cryoprecipitate (or lyophilized fibrinogen <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> fresh whole blood, if available) may be preferable to giving a large volume crystalloid infusion.

If an intrauterine fetal demise is identified or the fetus is clearly previable, then the entire focus of care becomes the optimal care of the mother. The limit of viability is defined as the stage of maturity that would ensure a reasonable chance of survival without severe deficits.</p><p>Determining the limit of viability is desirable so that futile interventions that are costly and painful can be avoided in the <span class=\"nowrap\">fetus/neonate</span> that does not have the possibility of a reasonably favorable outcome. However, deciding upon a threshold of viability is challenging, as it remains uncertain which extremely preterm infants, particularly those born at 23 and 24 weeks of gestation, have a reasonable chance of survival without severe deficits. The short- and long-term morbidity from prematurity, the intensity of care required, and the likelihood of survival at various gestational ages are discussed in detail separately.

In these cases, the maternal and fetal risks and benefits of immediate delivery for treatment of DIC versus delaying delivery to optimize fetal outcomes need to be weighed. Involving the neonatology and anesthesia services can help when discussing these issues with the patient or her legal guardians.

Delivery is initiated, as removal of the products of conception removes the trigger for DIC in many obstetric cases and causes the myometrium to contract (uterine involution), thus addressing both the major source and the major site of hemorrhage. In the second trimester, dilation and extraction is a good option for rapid uterine evacuation if the clinician is skilled in this procedure. In other cases, labor should be induced if it has not already ensued, or be augmented if it is not progressing rapidly.</p><p>If the cervix is unfavorable, we use both a mechanical method of cervical ripening (balloon catheter or hygroscopic dilator) and a pharmacologic method of labor induction (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=oxytocin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">oxytocin</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=misoprostol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">misoprostol</a>).

Vaginal delivery is not the safest maternal option if hemodynamic instability from ongoing brisk uterine bleeding persists despite vigorous transfusion of blood and blood products or if the mother would be endangered by vaginal delivery (eg, previous classical hysterotomy). In these cases, cesarean delivery is indicated to save the mother's life. Cesarean delivery is also indicated if prompt delivery has the potential to reduce fetal morbidity and mortality.</p><p>It is desirable, but not always possible, to correct or improve the clotting abnormality prior to cesarean delivery. A delay in operative intervention could lead to worsening of the coagulopathy, further blood loss, and, potentially, fetal death. On the other hand, immediate operative intervention in a woman with severe hypovolemia and DIC could prove fatal for the woman. If a cesarean delivery has to be performed urgently, then red blood cells, fresh frozen plasma (FFP), platelets, cryoprecipitate (or other source of fibrinogen such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=fibrinogen-concentrate-from-human-plasma-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">fibrinogen concentrate</a> [eg, RiaSTAP, Fibryga (formely Fibryna)]) should be available in the operating room and administered if clinically indicated (eg, for persistent bleeding without clotting from incision and needle sites). FFP <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> cryoprecipitate should be given immediately, without waiting for the results of laboratory studies.

If interventional radiology services are available, they should be notified of the possible need for their services as well.

These decisions are based on individual patient characteristics and the clinical experience of the surgeon. We prefer an infraumbilical vertical midline incision because it is fast, provides excellent exposure of both the upper and lower pelvis, and is less likely than a transverse incision to be complicated by a postpartum rectus sheath (subfascial) hematoma. After delivery of the fetus, we manually extract the placenta to hasten uterine involution.

These techniques include utero-ovarian vessel ligation, uterine compression sutures, and intrauterine balloon tamponade. If uterine bleeding remains brisk and maternal hemodynamic status is deteriorating despite initial surgical interventions and blood component replacement, we use a Penrose drain or urinary catheter as a uterine tourniquet. The drain is placed as low as possible around the lower uterine segment without incorporating the urinary bladder, and then the two ends are pulled in opposite directions and as tightly as possible around the corpus to mechanically occlude the vascular supply. A second or third tourniquet can also be applied, as needed. The tourniquet can be held in place with a clamp (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F113917\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef113917 \">figure 5</a>). This procedure markedly reduces blood loss and allows time for the anesthesia team members to catch up with transfusion requirements. When the patient is hemodynamically stable, the tourniquet is removed, and the surgical procedure is completed. The abdomen is closed in a standard fashion. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=postpartum-hemorrhage-management-approaches-requiring-laparotomy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Postpartum hemorrhage: Management approaches requiring laparotomy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Packing</strong> &ndash; Some patients will continue to bleed despite these measures and can enter a lethal downward spiral characterized by hypothermia, coagulopathy, and metabolic acidosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-during-pregnancy/abstract/71\" class=\"abstract_t\">71</a>]. Criteria proposed for this &quot;in extremis&quot; state include pH &lt;7.30, temperature &lt;35&deg;C, combined resuscitation and procedural time &gt;90 minutes, nonmechanical bleeding, and transfusion requirement &gt;10 units packed red blood cells [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-during-pregnancy/abstract/72\" class=\"abstract_t\">72</a>]. To abort the cycle, the pelvic bleeding needs to be acutely controlled. In some cases, this can be achieved by tightly packing the area using a pelvic pressure pack or lap sponges [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-during-pregnancy/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. If the abdomen is packed as a temporizing effort, the abdominal wound, including the fascia, is left open and a pressure dressing is applied. We have also used towel clips to temporarily reapproximate the <span class=\"nowrap\">skin/subcutaneous</span> tissue.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">It is prudent to place a large bore drain to alert the team to any ongoing massive bleeding, as the abdomen may need to be opened and repacked or some other intervention attempted. The recently pregnant abdomen will never provide sufficient pressure to tamponade a major bleed, thus this should not be regarded as an option. The procedure for pelvic packing is described separately.

As in nonpregnant individuals, mortality depends on the ability to reverse the underlying cause as rapidly as possible. A review of DIC scoring systems in nonpregnant individuals found a strong correlation between increasing severity of DIC and mortality; whether this correlation translates to pregnancy is unknown [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-during-pregnancy/abstract/48\" class=\"abstract_t\">48</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H194037363\" class=\"local\">'Scoring systems'</a> above.)</p><p>Most patients with DIC due to pregnancy-related complications rapidly improve with delivery and treatment of coagulopathy. In cases complicated by liver dysfunction (eg, acute fatty liver of pregnancy), however, resolution of DIC can take as long as four to five days postpartum because the liver is the source of most coagulation factors and the site for clearance of D-dimer [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-during-pregnancy/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].</p><p>DIC is a major contributor to maternal mortality. In a study based on discharge coding data from the United States Nationwide Inpatient Sample, approximately one-quarter of maternal deaths between 1998 and 2009 were attributed, at least in part, to DIC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-during-pregnancy/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]. However, the majority of women with obstetric DIC survive. In a review of 49 cases of DIC, only three maternal deaths occurred (6 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/disseminated-intravascular-coagulation-during-pregnancy/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p>Hysterectomy rates in DIC vary.

Severe postpartum hemorrhage by itself usually does not cause DIC unless associated with increased release of tissue factor. Prolonged retention of a dead fetus over several weeks is now a rare cause of DIC because these cases are identified early and delivered without significant delay. (See <a href=\"#H1949821\" class=\"local\">'Underlying causes'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of acute DIC in a pregnant woman is made when the clinical setting is appropriate and she has laboratory evidence of thrombocytopenia, coagulation factor consumption (eg, prolonged prothrombin time [PT] and activated partial thromboplastin time [aPTT]; low fibrinogen), and fibrinolysis (eg, increasing D-dimer). Bleeding is often present but is not required for diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H147348577\" class=\"local\">'Diagnostic evaluation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The key elements in managing the pregnant woman with DIC are to identify and treat the underlying disorder and provide supportive care (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F89030\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef89030 \">table 6</a>), particularly administration of blood products. (See <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Maternal management'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For women with heavy bleeding, we order a minimum of 6 units of packed red blood cells (pRBCs), 6 units of fresh frozen plasma (FFP), 10 bags of cryoprecipitate (1 dose), and 1 dose of platelets (either 4 to 6 whole blood-derived platelet units or 1 platelet apheresis) and begin transfusion of blood products prior to receiving initial laboratory results. We suggest transfusion of FFP, platelets, and RBCs in a ratio of 1:1:1 in cases of severe hemorrhage (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). This ratio is expected to reduce the risk dilutional coagulopathy. (See <a href=\"#H4054331221\" class=\"local\">'Transfusion targets'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We draw laboratory studies every 30 minutes to guide blood product replacement, and we transfuse blood products to achieve the following minimum levels for delivery (see <a href=\"#H4054331221\" class=\"local\">'Transfusion targets'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Hemoglobin &ge;7 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Platelet count <span class=\"nowrap\">&ge;50,000/microL</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Fibrinogen &gt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>PT and aPTT less than 1.5 times control</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If the fetus is nonviable, the goal is minimizing maternal morbidity and mortality. In the second trimester, we suggest dilatation and extraction (D&amp;E) rather than induction, if clinicians skilled in performing D&amp;E are available (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). Otherwise, in most cases, we favor supporting the mother with crystalloid (with or without colloid) and blood products and inducing or augmenting labor. (See <a href=\"#H21711045\" class=\"local\">'Hemodynamically stable mother with dead or nonviable fetus'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to standard indications for cesarean delivery, a cesarean is indicated if hemodynamic instability from ongoing brisk uterine bleeding persists despite vigorous transfusion of blood and blood products. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Hemodynamically unstable mother or fetal distress or contraindication to vaginal delivery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is desirable, but not always possible, to correct the coagulopathy prior to surgery. If a cesarean delivery must be performed urgently, pRBCs, FFP, platelets, and cryoprecipitate should be available in the operating room and administered if indicated. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Hemodynamically unstable mother or fetal distress or contraindication to vaginal delivery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For uterine bleeding that persists despite standard measures, we use a Penrose drain or urinary catheter as a uterine tourniquet. This procedure markedly reduces blood loss and allows time to catch up with transfusion requirements. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Hemodynamically unstable mother or fetal distress or contraindication to vaginal delivery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Even though hysterectomy is considered a last resort in women who wish to preserve childbearing capacity, it should be performed promptly if continued bleeding persists despite other preventive measures. These women can enter a lethal downward spiral characterized by hypothermia, coagulopathy, and metabolic acidosis. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Hemodynamically unstable mother or fetal distress or contraindication to vaginal delivery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If hysterectomy is not performed, then the bleeding area should be tightly packed and the wound dressed, but left open. The patient is continuously monitored, blood products are administered as appropriate, and any physiologic derangements are corrected. When the patient is stable, definitive surgical interventions can be performed.
