The risk of dying or of developing complications is related to the age and general health of the patient, to the causative pathogen, to the severity and duration of illness at the time of presentation, and occasionally to delays in the initiation of antibiotic therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-therapy-and-prognosis-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial therapy and prognosis of bacterial meningitis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Complications due to bacterial meningitis can be divided into systemic and neurologic. Systemic complications, such as septic shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and septic or reactive arthritis, are usually the consequence of the bacteremia that frequently accompanies meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p>The neurologic complications of bacterial meningitis include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Impaired mental status</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Increased intracranial pressure and cerebral edema</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Seizures</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Focal neurologic deficits (eg, cranial nerve palsy, hemiparesis)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cerebrovascular abnormalities</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sensorineural hearing loss</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Intellectual impairment</p><p/><p>These complications may be sudden or gradual in onset and can appear at any time after the onset of symptoms, including after the completion of therapy.

The possible protective role of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> therapy to prevent neurologic complications in selected patients and more general issues, such as the clinical manifestations, diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis of bacterial meningitis in adults, as well as neurologic complications in neonates and children with bacterial meningitis, are discussed separately.

In a review of 493 episodes of bacterial meningitis in adults, 28 percent of community-acquired episodes resulted in one or more neurologic complication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. No distinction was made in this study between transient and long-term complications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This is an important clinical issue, since many complications are transient. The usually short duration of neurologic complications was illustrated in a report of 269 adults with community-acquired bacterial meningitis: a neurologic deficit developed in 21 percent during the course of the illness, but only 9 percent had a neurologic deficit at discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The major persistent abnormal neurologic findings were hearing loss, a major motor deficit, impaired cognition or speech, and cranial nerve palsy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Baseline features have been used to estimate the individual risk for an adverse neurologic outcome in adults with bacterial meningitis in nine studies involving different populations and settings [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Most of these studies were hampered by methodologic problems related to study design, data collection, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> analysis. As a result, no prognostic scoring system performs well enough to be useful by itself in patient management.</p><p>However, in one study, three baseline clinical features (hypotension, altered mental status, and seizures) were independently associated with an adverse outcome (defined as in-hospital death or neurologic deficit at discharge) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Delay in initial antibiotics in the emergency department (median delay of four hours) was associated with a worsening of these markers in about 15 percent of adults. Patients whose delay in antibiotic therapy allowed their disease to advance from having zero or one to having two or three poor prognostic indicators had a significant increase in adverse outcomes. This finding supports the recommendation to avoid delays in antimicrobial therapy in patients with suspected bacterial meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-therapy-and-prognosis-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults#H6\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial therapy and prognosis of bacterial meningitis in adults&quot;, section on 'Avoidance of delay'</a>.)</p><p>In addition to the above general risk factors, the rate of complications is greatest in patients with pneumococcal meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. This may result in part from the persistence of potent biologic activity in the debris of killed bacteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. The debris may stimulate the host inflammatory response, which in turn contributes to tissue damage. This phenomenon may also contribute to the reduction in neurologic complications seen in some patients with pneumococcal meningitis who are treated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a>. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-to-prevent-neurologic-complications-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dexamethasone to prevent neurologic complications of bacterial meningitis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">NEUROLOGIC COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As noted above, neurologic complications can develop at any time during the course of bacterial meningitis. Impaired mental status is seen most often in patients at the time of presentation; seizures are more often seen during the early acute phase of illness. Although it may also occur early, sensorineural hearing loss is typically not appreciated until the patient has recovered from the acute illness. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of acute bacterial meningitis in adults&quot;, section on 'Presenting manifestations'</a>.)</p><p>Most patients who develop neurologic complications but survive the acute episode improve with appropriate therapy of the meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. In a study of 301 adults in whom mental status was assessed by the Glasgow outcome scale at eight weeks in the 269 survivors, 90 percent had mild or no disability, 7 percent had moderate disability, and 3 percent had severe disability [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Patients with substantial impairment in consciousness on admission were more likely to have unfavorable long-term outcomes. Similar findings were noted in the review of 269 patients in which 9 percent of survivors had a neurologic deficit at discharge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>A higher rate of moderate to severe neurologic disability at discharge (34 percent) was noted in a later study of 696 adults from the Netherlands [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. The rate was much higher with pneumococcal compared with meningococcal meningitis (50 versus 12 percent). This finding is consistent with the generally worse outcomes and increased mortality seen with pneumococcal compared with other causes of bacterial meningitis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-therapy-and-prognosis-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults#H31\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial therapy and prognosis of bacterial meningitis in adults&quot;, section on 'Mortality'</a>.)</p><p>Age may have an impact on the risk of adverse neurologic outcomes in patients with acute bacterial meningitis. In a prospective observational study that examined outcomes of 635 episodes of meningitis over a 28-year period, patients 65 years of age or older were significantly more likely to have neurologic complications or to die than patients aged 15 to 64 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>].</p><p>Concern about both the mortality and morbidity of bacterial meningitis has led to the administration of adjunctive <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> in selected patients. The data supporting this approach and the indications for dexamethasone therapy are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-to-prevent-neurologic-complications-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Dexamethasone to prevent neurologic complications of bacterial meningitis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Altered mental status</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Altered mental status is a common presenting feature in children and adults with bacterial meningitis. The major cause of severely diminished consciousness and coma is increased intracranial pressure (ICP).</p><p>In large studies of bacterial meningitis in adults, the incidence of altered mental status ranged from 78 to 83 percent at presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/2-4\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-4</a>]. In the review of 279 patients with community-acquired meningitis, for example, the mental status was altered in 78 percent at presentation. Most patients were confused or lethargic, but 22 percent were responsive only to pain and 6 percent were unresponsive to all stimuli [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In other series, coma [defined as Glasgow coma score &lt;8; (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEURO%2F81854\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef81854 \">table 1</a>)] was noted in 14 to 16 percent at presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Increased intracranial pressure</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many patients with bacterial meningitis develop increased ICP, which can produce a number of clinical signs or problems.

The pathogenesis of seizures in meningitis is not well understood. Although fever may be a cofactor in very young children, bacterial toxins or secondary neurochemical changes are presumably the cause of most seizures. In one study, for example, the occurrence of seizures correlated with colony counts of greater than 10<sup>7</sup> colony-forming units (CFU) in the CSF sample prior to treatment [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p>Seizures can be present at the time of admission or develop during hospitalization. In a prospective study of 696 episodes of community-acquired bacterial meningitis in adults, seizures occurred in 5 percent before admission and 15 percent after admission; the median time between admission and the first seizure was one day [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/5,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,13</a>]. Early-onset seizures are more common in patients with a history of alcoholism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Seizures can be generalized or focal.</p><p>The incidence of seizures was significantly increased in patients with pneumococcal meningitis (24 versus 5 percent with meningococcal meningitis) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/5,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">5,13</a>], a finding noted in other reports [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Other risk factors for seizures in one of these series were a predisposing condition, tachycardia, low Glasgow coma scale score, focal neurologic deficits, a low CSF white blood cell (WBC) count (&lt;1000 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/mm<sup>3</sup>),</span> and a higher CSF protein level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In a randomized, placebo-controlled trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> therapy, seizures were less likely in the treated patient group (5 versus 12 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p>Seizures during an episode of acute meningitis are often a poor prognostic sign in adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/3,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,13</a>].

All five patients with status epilepticus in this case series died.</p><p>Adults who have seizures during an episode of meningitis have a small but significant risk of seizures after recovery. In a follow-up study of 199 adult survivors of bacterial meningitis, patients with seizures during the acute illness were more likely to develop recurrent seizures within five years than those without seizures in the acute phase (8 versus 2 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].

A cerebral infarct was noted in four, lesions consistent with septic emboli in two, and cavernous sinus thrombosis in one. Four patients without a lesion on initial scan had signs of an infarct on a later CT scan that was performed because of persistent hemiparesis in three and triplegia in one.</p><p>One report describes a series of six patients who developed cerebral thrombosis affecting the brainstem <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> thalamus as a subacute complication of pneumococcal meningitis 7 to 19 days after initial presentation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. All patients had received <a href=\"topic.htm?path=dexamethasone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">dexamethasone</a> initially, and five were treated again with high-dose steroids upon deterioration. Two patients survived with moderate to severe disability. Postmortem studies on two patients revealed thrombosis of penetrating arteries without evidence of vasculitis.</p><p>Among 68 patients admitted to a neurologic intensive care unit with bacterial meningitis, a reduced level of consciousness at the time of admission and a low white blood cell count in the cerebrospinal fluid were found to be predictive factors for cerebral infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/neurologic-complications-of-bacterial-meningitis-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].</p><p>A number of other rare cerebrovascular complications have been described in isolated reports.

Fifty of the 129 (39 percent) patients with a hearing deficit were not suspected of having a hearing deficit at hospital discharge. Of the 240 patients, 16 (7 percent) had profound unilateral hearing loss and another 16 (7 percent) had profound bilateral hearing loss.

The risk of dying or of developing complications is related to the age and general health of the patient, the causative pathogen, the severity and duration of illness at the time of presentation, and occasionally to delays in the initiation of antibiotic therapy. (See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Complications due to bacterial meningitis can be divided into systemic and neurologic. Systemic complications, such as septic shock, disseminated intravascular coagulation, acute respiratory distress syndrome, and septic or reactive arthritis, are usually the consequence of the bacteremia that frequently accompanies meningitis.

Impaired mental status is seen in most patients at presentation, and seizures are more often seen during the acute episode.
