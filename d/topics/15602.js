It can also happen with certain herbal products and street drugs. There are many medicines and drugs that can lead to serotonin syndrome. In general, they all affect a chemical in the brain and body called &quot;serotonin.&quot;</p><p>Examples of the medicines and drugs that can cause serotonin syndrome include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some medicines used to treat depression</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some medicines used to treat Parkinson disease, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=selegiline-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">selegiline</a> (sample brand name: Eldepryl) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rasagiline-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">rasagiline</a> (brand name: Azilect)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some pain relievers, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=meperidine-pethidine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">meperidine</a> (sample brand name: Demerol), <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tramadol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">tramadol</a> (sample brand name: Ultram), and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclobenzaprine-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">cyclobenzaprine</a> (sample brand name: Flexeril)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Saint John's wort (an herbal medicine sometimes used for depression)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines used to treat migraine headaches, called &quot;triptans&quot;</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Some antibiotics, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=linezolid-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">linezolid</a> (brand name: Zyvox)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Street drugs, such as ecstasy, cocaine, and amphetamines</p><p/><p>Doctors do not know why some people get serotonin syndrome and others do not. But they do know that people usually get it within hours of taking a new medicine or drug, a new dose, or a new combination of medicines or drugs.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H630547309\"><span class=\"h1\">Should I see a doctor or nurse?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. If you have symptoms of serotonin syndrome, and you recently took a new drug or medicine or a new dose, call your doctor right away. If your symptoms are severe, go to the emergency room or <strong>call for an ambulance (in the US and Canada, dial 9-1-1)</strong>.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H630547324\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Maybe. There is no one test that can show whether or not you have serotonin syndrome. Still, some of the things the doctor will do during the exam can help him or her figure out if you have it. For instance, the doctor might test your leg muscles to see if they spasm. The doctor will also ask a lot of questions about any medicines, herbal products, or street drugs you might have taken.</p><p>If you have serotonin syndrome, it's very important that you be honest with your doctor about what you took, how much, and when.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H630547339\"><span class=\"h1\">How is serotonin syndrome treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As part of treatment, the doctor will stop the medicines or drugs that caused the serotonin syndrome in the first place. He or she will also monitor your breathing, heart rate, blood pressure, and body temperature, and try to keep these as close to normal as possible.</p><p>Depending on what you need, he or she might also:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Give you medicines to calm you</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Give you medicines to block the effects of serotonin</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Work with you to decide whether you should keep taking the medicines that caused your serotonin syndrome</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H630547354\"><span class=\"h1\">Can serotonin syndrome be prevented?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>No, but there are things you can do to protect yourself.</p><p>Doctors have no way to predict who will get serotonin syndrome, so it's not possible to prevent cases caused by properly prescribed medicines. Even so, there are things you can do to protect yourself from dangerous reactions to medicines:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Always tell any doctor who prescribes medicines for you about all the medicines, herbal products, and street drugs you take. That way, the doctor can be careful not to give you medicines that could cause problems when combined.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When starting a new medicine, have the pharmacist check for drug interactions and double-check that you are taking the right amount.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>If you are already on medicine, do not take a new herbal or over-the-counter medicine without first checking with your doctor, nurse, or pharmacist.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H630547369\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=medicines-for-depression-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Medicines for depression (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=depression-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Depression (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=depression-in-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Depression in adults (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=depression-treatment-options-for-adults-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Depression treatment options for adults (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
