This interferes with the formation of thrombi, thereby reducing the risk of stroke. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-for-the-secondary-prevention-of-atherosclerotic-cardiovascular-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aspirin for the secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The effectiveness of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> for preventing ischemic stroke and cardiovascular events is supported by the following observations:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A 2002 meta-analysis from the Antithrombotic Trialists Collaboration (ATC) analyzed 195 randomized controlled trials comparing antiplatelet therapy, primarily <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, with placebo in the prevention of stroke, myocardial infarction (MI), and vascular death among high-risk patients with some vascular disease or other condition implying an increased risk of occlusive vascular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiplatelet-therapy-for-secondary-prevention-of-stroke/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Patients treated with an antiplatelet agent had a 25 percent relative risk reduction in nonfatal stroke compared with placebo. Among the subset of patients with prior cerebrovascular disease (transient ischemic attack [TIA] or stroke), antiplatelet therapy reduced the risk of secondary stroke, MI, or vascular death by 22 percent; the absolute benefit was 36 events prevented per 1000 patients treated for 29 months. The benefit of antiplatelet therapy was independent of sex, age (greater or less than 65), diabetes, or hypertension.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a 2009 ATC meta-analysis of 16 placebo-controlled secondary prevention trials, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> reduced the risk of any serious vascular event by 19 percent and reduced the risk of ischemic stroke by 22 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiplatelet-therapy-for-secondary-prevention-of-stroke/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a 2016 pooled analysis of data from over 15,000 subjects in 12 trials evaluating <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> for secondary prevention, the benefit of aspirin was strongest in the early weeks after TIA or ischemic stroke [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiplatelet-therapy-for-secondary-prevention-of-stroke/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Aspirin reduced the relative risk of recurrent ischemic stroke within the first six weeks by 58 percent (1 versus 2.4 percent, absolute risk reduction 1.4 percent, hazard ratio [HR] 0.42, 95% CI 0.32-0.55). The benefit of aspirin in this timeframe was greatest for the subgroup of patients with TIA or minor stroke (relative risk reduction of 80 percent, absolute risk reduction 0.7 percent, HR 0.19, 95% CI 0.11&ndash;0.34). Although the included secondary prevention trials treated few patients in the first days after the index stroke or TIA, similar risk reductions with aspirin were found in trials of aspirin for acute stroke and TIA, as reviewed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=antithrombotic-treatment-of-acute-ischemic-stroke-and-transient-ischemic-attack#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Antithrombotic treatment of acute ischemic stroke and transient ischemic attack&quot;, section on 'Aspirin'</a>.)</p><p/><p>Stopping antiplatelet therapy in high-risk patients may itself increase the risk of stroke. One study found that 13 of 289 patients hospitalized with cerebral infarction had recently stopped antiplatelet therapy; most had been taking <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiplatelet-therapy-for-secondary-prevention-of-stroke/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. In all 13, the antiplatelet agent had been discontinued within 6 to 10 days of stroke onset, a time course consistent with the known lifespan (about 10 days) of inhibited platelets. Additionally, a case-control study comparing 309 patients with stroke to 309 matched controls found that discontinuation of aspirin was associated with a significantly increased risk of TIA or ischemic stroke (odds ratio 3.4, 95% CI 1.08-10.63) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiplatelet-therapy-for-secondary-prevention-of-stroke/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>].</p><p>In addition to its benefit for secondary stroke prevention, treatment with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> decreases the risk of other cardiovascular events in a wide range of patients with established disease. Furthermore, there is considerable evidence that long-term aspirin use reduces the risk of death from certain cancers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cancer-prevention#H35\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cancer prevention&quot;, section on 'Aspirin and other antiinflammatory drugs'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-for-the-secondary-prevention-of-atherosclerotic-cardiovascular-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Aspirin for the secondary prevention of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The issues of nonresponse and resistance to <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a>, and the effect of enteric coating on antiplatelet activity, are discussed separately.

Most studies have found that 50 to 325 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> of aspirin is as effective as higher doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiplatelet-therapy-for-secondary-prevention-of-stroke/abstract/1,6-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,6-11</a>]. Furthermore, lower doses within this range appear to provide the same benefit as higher doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiplatelet-therapy-for-secondary-prevention-of-stroke/abstract/1,7,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,7,11</a>].</p><p>As an example, a review of 195 trials of secondary prevention by the ATC showed that doses of 75 to 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> produced the same risk reduction, compared with placebo, as doses of 150 to 325 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiplatelet-therapy-for-secondary-prevention-of-stroke/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. In the ATC analysis of trials directly comparing <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> &lt;75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> with aspirin &ge;75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> there was no significant difference in effectiveness between the two regimens. However, the ATC noted that aspirin doses of &lt;75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> have been less widely assessed than doses of 75 to 150 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day,</span> so uncertainty remains regarding the effectiveness of doses &lt;75 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> compared with higher aspirin doses.</p><p>Even lower doses may be effective, as demonstrated in the Dutch TIA Trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiplatelet-therapy-for-secondary-prevention-of-stroke/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. This study found similar efficacy for stroke prevention with 30 mg compared with 283 mg of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> per day in patients who had had a TIA or minor ischemic stroke. In the European Stroke Prevention Study-2 (ESPS-2), 50 mg of aspirin daily reduced stroke risk by 18 percent compared with placebo (29 strokes prevented per 1000 treated), an effect of comparable magnitude to the other trials cited above [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiplatelet-therapy-for-secondary-prevention-of-stroke/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. This benefit seen with very low-dose aspirin is consistent with laboratory observations that 30 mg of aspirin per day results in complete suppression of thromboxane A2 production [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiplatelet-therapy-for-secondary-prevention-of-stroke/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Given the apparent equivalent benefit of different doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> for ischemic stroke prevention, and the increased risk of bleeding complications with higher dose aspirin discussed below, we recommend a dose of 50 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> when using aspirin for the secondary prevention of ischemic stroke. This recommendation is similar to the dose of 75 to 100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> recommended by current guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiplatelet-therapy-for-secondary-prevention-of-stroke/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Toxicity and risk of bleeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Lower doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> appear to be associated with less gastrointestinal toxicity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiplatelet-therapy-for-secondary-prevention-of-stroke/abstract/6,12,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,12,15</a>].

A similar dose relationship was seen for milder gastrointestinal symptoms.</p><p>In an analysis of data from 31 randomized, controlled trials, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> doses &le;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> were associated with a significantly lower rate of major bleeding events compared with higher doses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiplatelet-therapy-for-secondary-prevention-of-stroke/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. However, there was no difference in major bleeding when aspirin &lt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> was compared with 100 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span>. When the overall rate of bleeding complications (including major, minor and insignificant events) was considered, aspirin &lt;100 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> was associated with a lower risk compared with the 100 to 200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> and &gt;200 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day</span> groups.</p><p>A later meta-analysis of 22 randomized trials of low-dose <a href=\"topic.htm?path=aspirin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">aspirin</a> (75 to 325 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/day)</span> versus placebo for cardiovascular prophylaxis reached similar conclusions within the low-dose range [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/antiplatelet-therapy-for-secondary-prevention-of-stroke/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. Compared with placebo, aspirin increased the relative risk of any major bleeding, major gastrointestinal bleeding, and intracranial bleeding by 1.7- to 2.1-fold. However, the absolute annual increase in risk for any major bleeding episode (mostly gastrointestinal) and for intracranial bleeding was 0.13 and 0.03 percent, respectively.
