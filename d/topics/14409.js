Although barriers to long-term survival remain, the outcome among transplant recipients has improved over several decades as a result of careful recipient and donor selection, advances in immunosuppression, and the prevention and treatment of opportunistic infections.

This database includes data from over 100,000 cardiac transplants performed worldwide since 1982 by more than 380 transplant programs. Although center-specific data may vary, survival figures from data like the ISHLT registry are often quoted when providing patients with realistic expectations regarding survival after transplantation.

Patient survival has steadily improved since the 1980s, with one-year survival rates now exceeding 85 percent for adult patients and 90 percent for pediatric patients transplanted in the most current era (2009 through June 2015). The major survival gains are limited to the first 6 to 12 months, with a long-term attrition rate of 3.4 percent per year thereafter, remaining largely unchanged. The improvement is probably larger than it appears since the risk profile of recipients and the age of donors continue to increase.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Determinants of prognosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A number of factors in the recipient and donor are associated with a worse prognosis post-transplantation.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h3\">Recipient factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Among patients receiving a heart transplant between January 2010 and June 2015, the use of a total artificial heart as a bridge to transplant, as well as the need for end-organ support with mechanical ventilation or dialysis, conferred the greatest risk of <strong>one-year</strong> mortality. Additional risk factors include the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=amiodarone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">amiodarone</a> pretransplantation, prior coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) before transplantation, and transplantation of a female heart into a male recipient (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F115273\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef115273 \">figure 1</a>). </p><p>Patients who undergo transplantation for nonischemic cardiomyopathy have the best prognosis, whereas patients with a history of congenital heart disease, restrictive cardiomyopathy, and those undergoing retransplantation have inferior survival compared with other patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>Markers of end-organ function such as pre-transplant serum creatinine and total bilirubin are linearly related to post-transplant survival. For example, a serum creatinine of 2.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> is associated with a hazard ratio of 1.6 for death within the first year post-transplant, whereas a bilirubin level of 2.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> is associated with a hazard ratio of 1.2. Recipient age has a curvilinear, or U-shaped, relationship with survival, whereby younger (ages 18 to 29) and older (ages 60 to 69 and &ge;70) recipients have inferior survival compared with patients aged 30 to 59 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Finally, pre-operative clinical stability is a strong predictor of early post-transplant outcomes. Among patients listed for emergent heart transplantation in the Spanish National Heart Transplant Registry database, recipients meeting the Interagency Registry for Mechanically Assisted Circulatory Support (INTERMACS) profile 1 criteria (cardiogenic shock) and profile 2 criteria (progressive clinical decline despite treatment with inotropes) had the highest risk of primary graft failure, dialysis requirement, and in-hospital mortality following heart transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Donor factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Donor-related factors can have an adverse impact on early prognosis. Advanced donor age (linear relationship) and prolonged donor heart ischemia time (curvilinear relationship with increased risk noted above 200 minutes) are both associated with increased recipient one-year mortality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>Because of the shortage of optimal heart donors, some transplant programs have begun to consider and accept hearts from &quot;suboptimal&quot; or &quot;marginal&quot; donors (eg, donors over age 55 and those with mild left ventricular hypertrophy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/5-7\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-7</a>]. Long-term outcomes have yet to be assessed, but data suggest that one-year survival is similar to that of patients receiving &quot;optimal&quot; donors. However, the short-term outcome is reduced with donors with left ventricular hypertrophy who had hypertension or hypertrophy on the electrocardiogram (ECG) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-and-pathogenesis-of-left-ventricular-hypertrophy-in-hypertension\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition and pathogenesis of left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertension&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H25978813\"><span class=\"h3\">Patients undergoing mechanical circulatory support as a bridge to transplant</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 50 percent of patients undergoing heart transplantation are now bridged to transplant with a mechanical circulatory support (MCS) device [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The majority (45 percent) of patients undergoing MCS prior to transplant receive a left ventricular assist device (LVAD), while the use of right ventricular assist devices, biventricular assist devices, and the total artificial heart remains relatively small (approximately 5 percent). Although LVAD use historically conferred a worse post-transplant prognosis, patients bridged to transplant with an LVAD between 2005 and June 2015 had comparable post-transplant survival to those supported to transplant with inotropes. The improved outcomes among patients supported with LVADs likely reflect the current practice of delaying transplantation after an LVAD implant to allow functional rehabilitation and recovery of end-organ function. By contrast, patients requiring extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) support have considerably worse survival than those bridged to transplant with other forms of MCS [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=intermediate-and-long-term-mechanical-circulatory-support\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Intermediate- and long-term mechanical circulatory support&quot;</a>.) </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Late mortality</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Risk factors for 5- and 10-year mortality are less well defined. In addition to the risk factors associated with early mortality, additional factors such as elevated recipient body mass index, diabetes mellitus, prior hepatitis B infection, and the presence of pre-formed alloantibodies in the recipient prior to transplant all confer an increased risk of late mortality. Additionally, several post-transplant risk factors have been associated with an increased risk of late mortality. These include the use of interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor antagonists for induction therapy, dialysis requirement before discharge from the transplant hospitalization, and the development of allograft rejection within the first year post-transplantation. Lack of immunosuppressive therapy with a combination of at least two of the following classes of drugs also conferred a significant risk of late mortality: calcineurin inhibitors, cell cycle inhibitors, and proliferation signal inhibitors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=induction-and-maintenance-of-immunosuppressive-therapy-in-cardiac-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Induction and maintenance of immunosuppressive therapy in cardiac transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Causes of death</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There are four major causes of death after cardiac transplantation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Graft failure: Primary graft failure accounts for the majority of mortality within the first 30 days after transplantation. It may be immediately apparent in the operating room or present within the first 24 hours after allograft implant. The syndrome is thought to be caused by a heterogeneous group of etiologies, including donor-related factors (pre-existing donor myocardial dysfunction or catecholamine-induced myocardial injury), preservation injury, and transplant-related factors (air embolism, cardioplegia, or delayed reperfusion injury), and recipient related factors such as unrecognized pulmonary arterial hypertension. Graft failure occurring after the first week post-transplantation typically results from either acute rejection or cardiac allograft vasculopathy.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Opportunistic infections: Infections are the leading single cause of death between six months to one year post-transplant. The types of infection in these patients are diverse, including common, community-acquired bacterial and viral diseases and uncommon opportunistic infections of clinical significance only in immunocompromised hosts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/8,9\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,9</a>]. The risk of infection in the heart transplant patient is determined by a semi-quantitative relationship between two factors: the epidemiologic exposures of the individual and the &quot;net state of immunosuppression,&quot; which is a measure of all of the factors that contribute to the individual's susceptibility (or resistance) to infection. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=infection-in-the-solid-organ-transplant-recipient\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Infection in the solid organ transplant recipient&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute allograft rejection: Cellular and antibody-mediated rejection represent an important cause of death within the first three years after transplantation, accounting for approximately 10 percent of deaths during this period. Thereafter, the incidence of death related to allograft rejection declines. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acute-cardiac-allograft-rejection-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Acute cardiac allograft rejection: Diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cardiac allograft vasculopathy (CAV): The incidence of CAV increases steadily after transplantation, and it is among the top three causes of death beyond the first year post-transplantation. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-prognosis-of-cardiac-allograft-vasculopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and prognosis of cardiac allograft vasculopathy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=prevention-and-treatment-of-cardiac-allograft-vasculopathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Prevention and treatment of cardiac allograft vasculopathy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lymphoma and other malignancies: Malignancy is the most frequent cause of death beginning at five years post-cardiac transplantation. Analyses of multiple databases have shown that malignancies (both lymphoma and solid tumors) are more common in heart compared with renal transplant recipients, probably due to the overall need for more intense immunosuppression. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-and-prevention-of-post-transplant-lymphoproliferative-disorders\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment and prevention of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=development-of-malignancy-following-solid-organ-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Development of malignancy following solid organ transplantation&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Repeat cardiac transplantation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Given the factors limiting long-term graft survival, heart transplant recipients in a small and highly selected subset (approximately 3 percent of transplant recipients) are considered candidates for retransplantation. The incidence of retransplantation has remained constant worldwide at 2 to 4 percent of adult heart transplants performed since 1982. Overall, the outcomes after retransplantation are inferior to primary heart transplantation with 1- and 10-year survivals of 70 and 38 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p>The prognosis after re-transplantation is related to two important variables: the etiology of the graft failure leading to re-transplantation and the interval between the first and second heart transplant. Patients re-transplanted for cardiac allograft vasculopathy have the most favorable prognosis, whereas those re-transplanted for primary graft failure have the worst prognosis, which is driven primarily by a very high mortality rate in the first year after re-transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. In a report of 514 patients, one-year mortality after retransplantation was also related to the time between the first and second transplant. Patients with an intertransplant interval of less than two years had inferior survival compared with those with longer intervals between transplants (60 versus 75 percent) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=CARD%2F65624\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef65624 \">figure 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h1\">HEART-LUNG TRANSPLANTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Heart-lung transplantation should be reserved for patients who cannot be treated by heart or lung transplantation alone. Suitable candidates include patients with severe, irreversible disease of the lung parenchyma or vasculature who also have severely compromised left or right ventricular function or other cardiac diseases that would preclude a successful outcome with lung transplantation alone. The two major causes among the small number of procedures that are performed are Eisenmenger syndrome associated with congenital heart disease and idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension with severe right ventricular failure. The outcomes in these patients are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=heart-lung-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Heart-lung transplantation&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h1\">HEART-KIDNEY TRANSPLANTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Simultaneous heart-kidney transplantation using allografts from the same donor is performed by some centers for patients with advanced heart failure and severely impaired renal function [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The number of heart-kidney transplants remains low, with approximately 55 to 70 combined transplants per year reported worldwide between 2004 and 2009 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Single- and multicenter observational studies have demonstrated comparable short- and long-term survival with simultaneous heart-kidney transplantation compared with isolated heart transplantation. Additionally, patients who received combined heart-kidney transplants experienced fewer episodes of cardiac allograft rejection and lower rates of cardiac allograft vasculopathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/11,12\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,12</a>].</p><p>There are two other issues related to impaired renal function and heart transplantation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Underlying moderate chronic kidney disease, defined as a stable plasma creatinine concentration above 2 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> (177 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L)</span> or a creatinine clearance below 40 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/min,</span> is a relative contraindication to isolated heart transplantation. Part of the concern in this setting is the superimposed nephrotoxicity of long-term calcineurin-inhibitor therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=indications-and-contraindications-for-cardiac-transplantation-in-adults#H20\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Indications and contraindications for cardiac transplantation in adults&quot;, section on 'Relative contraindications'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-and-tacrolimus-nephrotoxicity\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Cyclosporine and tacrolimus nephrotoxicity&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Renal transplantation may be performed as a later procedure to treat end-stage renal disease that has developed after heart transplantation (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=renal-function-and-nonrenal-solid-organ-transplantation#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Renal function and nonrenal solid organ transplantation&quot;, section on 'Cardiac transplantation'</a>). Among recipients of a kidney transplant after heart transplantation, kidney allograft survival was comparable to that of patients undergoing simultaneous heart and kidney transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31118279\"><span class=\"h1\">HEART-LIVER TRANSPLANTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Approximately 10 to 15 combined heart-liver transplants are performed world-wide each year by a small number of transplant centers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Among combined heart-liver transplants performed in the United States between October 1987 and February 2007, the most common indications for concurrent liver transplantation include familial transthyretin amyloidosis (30 percent), hepatitis C-associated cirrhosis (13 percent), hemochromatosis (13 percent), and cardiac cirrhosis (11 percent). Patient survival at one year, three years, and five years was 85, 80, and 76 percent and comparable to outcomes observed for single-organ liver or heart transplantation. Additionally, lower rates of rejection in the cardiac allograft were observed despite reduced levels of immunosuppression compared with isolated heart transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h1\">MEDICAL CONDITIONS AFTER CARDIAC TRANSPLANTATION THAT MAY AFFECT OUTCOME</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypertension, hyperlipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and renal dysfunction are all noted in a significant proportion of cardiac transplant recipients. Among recipients of a heart transplant between January 1994 and June 2015, diabetes was noted in 36 percent of patients at five years, severe renal dysfunction (serum creatinine greater than 2.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> [221 <span class=\"nowrap\">micromol/L])</span> in 14 percent, long-term dialysis in 3 percent, kidney transplant in 1 percent, and angiographic evidence of cardiac allograft vasculopathy in 29 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Although no longer reported in the registry, hypertension and hyperlipidemia are noted in over 90 percent and over 85 percent of heart transplant recipients, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lipid-abnormalities-after-cardiac-transplantation\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lipid abnormalities after cardiac transplantation&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=new-onset-diabetes-after-transplant-nodat-in-renal-transplant-recipients\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;New-onset diabetes after transplant (NODAT) in renal transplant recipients&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Due to the requirement for life-long immunosuppression, malignancies are also commonly noted in heart transplant recipients, and the incidence increases over time. Among patients receiving their heart transplants between January 1994 and June 2015, malignancies were reported in 16 percent of patients at five years and 28 percent at 10 years. The most common types of cancer detected at five years included cutaneous malignancies (10 percent), followed by solid organ tumors (6 percent), and lymphoproliferative malignancies (1 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">QUALITY OF LIFE AFTER TRANSPLANTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Data from the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation (ISHLT) indicate that nearly 90 percent of patients have no limitation of activity at one through five years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prognosis-after-cardiac-transplantation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. However, despite generally excellent functional capacity following cardiac transplantation, only 28 and 38 percent of recipients between the ages of 25 and 60 return to work at one and five years post-transplantation, respectively. In the United States, the discrepancy between functional status and employment may be in part related to the link between employability and insurability.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition.
