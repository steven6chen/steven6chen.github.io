Although there have been many advances in conservative renal replacement therapy, renal transplantation is the best treatment for children with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-renal-transplantation-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. This was shown in a study from Australia and New Zealand, in which the risk for death was more than four times higher in children with ESRD treated with dialysis rather than renal transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-renal-transplantation-in-children/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. Improvements in the care of young patients and advances in immunosuppressive therapy have also increased renal allograft and patient survival. Particularly, reduction in the frequency and severity of acute rejection has enhanced allograft survival [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-renal-transplantation-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>This topic will provide an overview of the complications of renal transplantation in children. Some complications of renal transplantation are unique to children, while others are observed in all transplant recipients. Additional issues concerning transplantation in children and issues in renal transplantation common to both children and adults are presented elsewhere.

The definition of DGF varies in different studies, but generally refers to oliguria or the requirement for dialysis within the first week post-transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-renal-transplantation-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Previously, patients with DGF have had a 15 to 25 percent lower graft survival rate than those without DGF. </p><p>The major causes of DGF in children are the following (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=evaluation-and-diagnosis-of-the-patient-with-renal-allograft-dysfunction\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Evaluation and diagnosis of the patient with renal allograft dysfunction&quot;</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-renal-transplantation-in-children/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Postischemic acute kidney injury is the most common cause of DGF</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thrombosis or embolization of the renal artery or vein</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Accelerated rejection superimposed on ischemic acute tubular necrosis (ATN)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Urologic abnormalities (ie, urinary leak or hematoma)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hyperacute rejection (generally preventable)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Factors related to the donor (ie, cardiovascular instability, older donor age, renal function based on <span class=\"nowrap\">serum/plasma</span> creatinine)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h3\">Acute kidney injury</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several factors may be responsible for postischemic acute kidney injury. These include the age and condition of the donor, specific recovery procedure, technique of organ preservation, adequacy of volume replacement during and after surgery, and the cold and warm ischemia times. Tubular damage may be aggravated by the use of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cyclosporine</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">tacrolimus</a>. There is evidence that the addition of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sirolimus-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">sirolimus</a> in combination with either cyclosporine or tacrolimus prolongs DGF.

The main risk for thrombosis is an extremely young donor or recipient. Other risk factors include hypercoagulability (such as that due to chronic nephrotic syndrome) and venous malformation in the recipient, pretransplant peritoneal dialysis, a hypotensive episode during or after surgery, the presence of multiple arteries, and bench surgery of graft vessels [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-renal-transplantation-in-children/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Although vascular thrombosis is usually observed within the first few days following transplantation, it can be seen as late as three weeks post-transplant.</p><p>The use of interleukin-2 receptor antagonists may be associated with a decreased risk of graft thrombosis. This was shown in a retrospective study of the North American Pediatric Renal Trials and Collaborative Studies (NAPRTCS) database of transplant patients between 1998 and 2004 in which the incidence of thrombosis was significantly lower among those who received such antibodies (1.07 versus 2.4 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-renal-transplantation-in-children/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Other measures that may reduce the incidence of vascular thrombosis include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Careful hemodynamic monitoring of central venous pressure to ensure adequate allograft perfusion.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Consideration of screening for inherited and acquired thrombophilic risk factors, especially if there is a family history or previous episode of thrombosis.

It is detected as hydronephrosis by renal ultrasonography.

In one trial, the use of a ureteral stent at renal transplantation significantly decreased urinary leak and obstruction with a reduction in overall medical costs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-renal-transplantation-in-children/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. In contrast, a retrospective study found no difference in graft survival and the risk of urinary leakage and ureteral stenosis between patients who had stent placement from those who did not [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-renal-transplantation-in-children/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In this report, stent placement also resulted in additional costs. Both studies demonstrated an increased risk of urinary tract infections with stent placement, especially if the stent remained in place beyond 30 days after transplant [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-renal-transplantation-in-children/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>].</p><p>At our institution, stents are used in recipients who have bladder abnormalities with increased risk of urinary retention or high pressure, and when the transplant surgeon has concerns about the donor ureter. Our policy is to remove stents before the fourth week post-transplant. (See <a href=\"#H28\" class=\"local\">'Surgical sequelae'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h3\">Hyperacute rejection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hyperacute rejection occurring within the first minutes following transplantation results from preformed host anti-human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antibodies that bind to vascular endothelial cells of the graft, resulting in activation of the complement cascade and endothelial injury. Neutrophils, macrophages, and platelets are attracted to the antibody binding site and cause further cellular damage. Platelet aggregation on the damaged endothelium leads to fibrin deposition and vascular thrombosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-renal-transplantation-in-children/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. There are also reports of hyperacute rejection associated with anti-endothelial antibodies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-renal-transplantation-in-children/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>], which are not detected using standard crossmatch methods using donor lymphocytes.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Acute rejection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Acute renal allograft rejection is a frequent complication of pediatric renal recipients, which may occur several days, weeks, or months after transplantation. It is defined as an acute deterioration in allograft function, generally detected by an elevation in the serum creatinine level, which is associated with specific pathologic changes in the graft obtained via an allograft biopsy. The two principal histologic forms of rejection are acute cellular rejection and acute antibody-mediated rejection, which are discussed in detail separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-acute-renal-allograft-rejection\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical features and diagnosis of acute renal allograft rejection&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In children with renal transplants, the rate of acute rejection has decreased over the past 30 years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-renal-transplantation-in-children/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. This decrease in the incidence of acute rejection appears to be due to the introduction of newer immunosuppressive agents [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-renal-transplantation-in-children/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Based upon the NAPRTCS data, hospitalization within the first 24 months following transplantation is more frequently caused by post-transplant infections than acute rejection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-renal-transplantation-in-children/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p>The classic signs of acute rejection, such as fever and graft tenderness, are observed less commonly with current immunosuppressive regimens. With these newer regimens, acute rejection episodes are often only detected by a rise in the serum concentration of creatinine.</p><p>Among stable pediatric allograft recipients, the following strategy relating to the timing of serum creatinine concentration measurement is recommended [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-renal-transplantation-in-children/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Daily measurement during the first two weeks</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Twice to three times a week two to four weeks after transplantation</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Twice per week during the second month</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weekly from the third to fourth month</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Twice a month from the fifth to eight months</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Monthly after the eighth month post-transplant</p><p/><p>Acute rejection is confirmed histologically via renal biopsy, a technique that can be performed with minimal risk in children [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-renal-transplantation-in-children/abstract/18,19\" class=\"abstract_t\">18,19</a>]. In the case of a small pediatric recipient of an adult-sized kidney, rejection may be present with no or only a small elevation in serum creatinine. In this setting, renal biopsy may be considered earlier when the results of the serum creatinine levels are equivocal.</p><p>There is ongoing debate on the role of protocol biopsy in children to detect subclinical rejection, assess response to therapy for rejection, and surveillance for chronic allograft nephropathy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-renal-transplantation-in-children/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. It remains to be demonstrated whether graft survival is improved by detecting these histological changes as suggested by results in adult patients.

This is a poorly understood disorder, and the etiology remains unknown. The revised 2005 Banff classification system renamed chronic allograft nephropathy to &quot;interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy, without evidence of any specific etiology&quot; because the terminology chronic allograft nephropathy was thought to discourage attempts to elucidate the underlying pathogenesis of this entity. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=chronic-renal-allograft-nephropathy#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Chronic renal allograft nephropathy&quot;, section on 'Banff grading system'</a>.)</p><p>In general, the clinical diagnosis is suggested by the gradual deterioration of graft function as manifested by a slowly rising <span class=\"nowrap\">serum/plasma</span> creatinine concentration, increasing proteinuria (occasionally causing nephrotic range proteinuria), and worsening hypertension. It occurs at least three months post-transplant in the absence of acute rejection, drug toxicity (principally calcineurin inhibitors), or other nephrologic diseases.</p><p>In a pediatric case series of 289 renal allografts, the risk factors for chronic allograft injury included at least one previous episode of acute rejection and the administration of low doses of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=cyclosporine-ciclosporin-pediatric-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_pediatric\">cyclosporine</a> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/complications-of-renal-transplantation-in-children/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].
