It is a laboratory finding that does not necessarily equate to a clinical disorder. This topic review will present the limited information available about this subject.</p><p>The normal production of IgE and pathogenic role of IgE in allergic disease are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-humoral-immune-response\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The humoral immune response&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PREVALENCE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prevalence of immunoglobulin E (IgE) deficiency depends upon the population under study. The authors measured serum IgE levels in 500 blood donors, 974 <span class=\"nowrap\">allergy/immunology</span> clinic patients, and 155 rheumatology clinic patients, and found deficient levels in 2.6, 8.1, and 9.7 percent, respectively. IgE deficiency was selective in 0.8, 3.1, and 1.3 percent of these cohorts. Associated immunoglobulin deficiencies varied among the three populations (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ALLRG%2F65822\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef65822 \">table 1</a>).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The pathogenesis of selective immunoglobulin E (IgE) deficiency is not known.

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-biology-of-ige\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The biology of IgE&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In contrast, the suggestive beneficial properties of IgE require further elucidation and are of particular interest since the introduction of anti-IgE therapy for the treatment of asthma and allergic disease, as this treatment essentially induces an iatrogenic form of IgE deficiency.

IgE anti-HIV antibody was detected in 43 percent of the children with high IgE levels.</p><p>A study of 75 long-term survivors of maternally-transmitted HIV infection found that 16 subjects had elevated total serum IgE levels and made anti-HIV IgE antibody capable of inhibiting HIV replication in vitro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-ige-deficiency/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]; the inhibitory effect was reversed when IgE was removed using immunoaffinity columns or anti-IgE antibody.</p><p>Researchers in another study measured IgE antiparvovirus B19 antibodies in immunoglobulin A (IgA)-deficient patients with new onset infection, and concluded that IgE is important in establishing immunity to this virus [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-ige-deficiency/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h3\">Parasitic infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In a study of 700 asymptomatic subjects from Tanzania, high IgE (but not immunoglobulin G [IgG]) directed against P. falciparum was associated with a reduced risk for subsequent development of clinically evident malaria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-ige-deficiency/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Another group found that P. falciparum-specific IgE antibody protected against the development of severe clinical disease, including cerebral malaria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-ige-deficiency/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p>There are also reports that IgE antibody can contribute to the expulsion of intestinal parasites, such as N. americanus (hookworm) and ascaris in humans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-ige-deficiency/abstract/9,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,11</a>]. In children, IgE antibodies provide immunity against B. burgdorferi that persists throughout adulthood [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-ige-deficiency/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Sinopulmonary bacterial infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several early reports suggested that isolated deficiencies in IgE were associated to chronic sinopulmonary disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-ige-deficiency/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>] whereas others studies found no such association [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-ige-deficiency/abstract/2,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,14</a>]. At the time, there was no standard methodology for measuring IgE levels, nor was there a common definition of what constituted deficiency.</p><p>The authors have found that selective IgE deficiency is associated with sinopulmonary infection with common respiratory pathogens, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Hemophilus influenzae, and Moraxella catarrhalis in patients attending their <span class=\"nowrap\">allergy/immunology</span> clinic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-ige-deficiency/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. However, other groups have not found this association [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-ige-deficiency/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Protection against airway disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The possibility that IgE may play a role in the regulation of the respiratory immune response is suggested by several studies in experimental animal models. Mice that are deficient in lymphotoxin alpha (LTalpha <span class=\"nowrap\">-/-</span> mice) also exhibit diminished levels of IgE and reduced allergic airway responsiveness to both environmental and induced antigen challenge [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-ige-deficiency/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. These mice develop inflammatory airway disease that is nonallergic and noninfectious and mediated by T helper type 1 (Th1) cells. The lung inflammation is alleviated by reconstitution of IgE. Furthermore, depletion of IgE in wild-type mice duplicates the lung pathologies of the LTalpha <span class=\"nowrap\">-/-</span> mice, and is also reversed by the administration of IgE.</p><p>These findings are consistent with the theory that the presence of subnormal levels of IgE impairs the ability of mast cells to respond normally to airway antigens, and consequently, to produce cytokines that favor Th2 development (interleukin [IL]-4, IL-13). As a result, Th1 responses to the uncleared antigens predominate and lead to pathology.</p><p>Thus, rather than merely priming mast cells to respond to specific antigens, IgE (in the absence of cross-linking antigens) may promote survival, receptor expression, and mediator release of mast cells and promote a healthy balance between Th1 and Th2 processes responses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-ige-deficiency/abstract/18-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">18-22</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Protection against autoimmune disease</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>There is an increased prevalence of autoimmune disease in persons with certain immunoglobulin deficiencies, particularly those with IgA deficiency [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-ige-deficiency/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

There are a number of potential mechanisms that could explain this association.</p><p>IgE is predominantly a mucosal immunoglobulin. It is possible that IgE protects against autoimmunization by preventing the systemic absorption of mucosal antigens, similar to the proposed function of IgA [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-ige-deficiency/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>].

Mast cells have been shown to be essential intermediaries in regulatory T cell (Treg) induced allograft tolerance in mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-ige-deficiency/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]; it is possible, therefore, that IgE deficiency predisposes to autoimmunity by adversely effecting mast cell survival and function.</p><p>Alternative hypotheses include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Common genetic factors predispose to both IgE deficiency and autoimmune disease.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low levels of IgE merely reflect an imbalance between Th1 and Th2 lymphocyte activity that, in turn, favors the development of Th1-mediated autoimmune diseases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-ige-deficiency/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Antitumor activity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>IgE has been shown to possess antitumor properties in vitro [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-ige-deficiency/abstract/31,32\" class=\"abstract_t\">31,32</a>] and in experimental mice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/selective-ige-deficiency/abstract/33-36\" class=\"abstract_t\">33-36</a>].
