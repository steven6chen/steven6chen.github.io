There is no conclusive evidence to support the implantation of an atrial pacemaker to prevent AF in patients with a history of AF but no indication for pacing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-pacemakers-in-the-prevention-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Similar to societal guidelines, we do not recommend the insertion of an atrial pacemaker for this purpose [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-pacemakers-in-the-prevention-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Overdrive (antitachycardia) atrial pacing'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H355254929\"><span class=\"h1\">PATIENTS WITH SYMPTOMATIC BRADYCARDIA</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many patients with atrial fibrillation (AF) have sick sinus syndrome with symptomatic bradycardia requiring pacemaker placement. Moreover, antiarrhythmic drug treatment may lead to sinus or atrioventricular nodal dysfunction that may require pacing in order to permit up-titration of drug dose. The appropriate pacing modes for patients with sick sinus syndrome are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sick-sinus-syndrome-treatment#H2002718\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sick sinus syndrome: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Treatment'</a>.)</p><p>In patients who require permanent pacing, only physiologic pacing from the right atrium has been shown to prevent episodes of AF.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H958522126\"><span class=\"h2\">Physiologic pacing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The term &quot;physiologic pacing&quot; has historically been used to describe the maintenance of atrioventricular (AV) synchrony. For patients with non-permanent AF who require permanent pacing, we place a dual chamber pacemaker and program it to physiologic pacing, which is discussed below. Physiologic pacing results in a significantly lower rate of AF.</p><p>Sinus rhythm leads to a predictable muscular activation sequence of different regions of the heart. This sequence optimizes cardiac output. Isolated right ventricular (RV) pacing disrupts the normal sequence of activation of the atria and ventricles in patients in normal sinus rhythm. The failure to activate the atria before the ventricles with RV pacing is termed AV dyssynchrony and may promote AF. This becomes part of the rationale for atrial pacing in patients with paroxysmal AF. In addition, RV pacing causes the RV to contract before the left ventricle (LV) and causes the septum to contract before the lateral wall of the LV, simulating the effects of left bundle branch block. This phenomenon is referred to as ventricular dyssynchrony or asynchrony and can also lead to AF. This risk can be reduced by maintaining AV synchrony (physiologic pacing) and by minimizing the amount of ventricular pacing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-pacemakers-in-the-prevention-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].

Physiologic pacing may be accomplished with atrial or AV pacing, which is also referred to as dual chamber.</p><p>A 2006 meta-analysis of physiologic versus ventricular pacing included 7231 patients and over 35,000 patient-years of follow-up [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-pacemakers-in-the-prevention-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Most patients assigned to physiologic pacing received a dual-chamber (DDD) pacemaker, and some received AAI pacing. Physiologic pacing resulted in a significantly lower rate of AF (hazard ratio 0.80, 95% CI 0.72-0.89). However, there was no significant reduction in mortality or heart failure. Other trials not included in the meta-analysis have come to similar conclusions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-pacemakers-in-the-prevention-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Alternate strategies of atrial pacing to prevent recurrent AF</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>As discussed above, we place a dual chamber pacemaker (with a lead in the right atrium and in the right ventricle) in patients with non-permanent AF who have symptomatic bradycardia and no indication for biventricular pacing. When possible, we pace from the right atrium only, attempting physiologic pacing. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sick-sinus-syndrome-treatment#H2876490510\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sick sinus syndrome: Treatment&quot;, section on 'Long-term management'</a>.)</p><p>The ability of other atrial pacing systems to suppress AF recurrences has been evaluated in several studies and has not been found to prevent the development of AF.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Alternative-site, dual-site right atrial, and biatrial pacing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Based on the available evidence, we do not perform alternative site, dual-site right atrial, or biatrial pacing to prevent episodes of AF.</p><p>The atria can be paced at sites other than the right atrial appendage, such as at the high interatrial septum near Bachman&rsquo;s bundle, or at two sites simultaneously to provide greater synchronization of atrial tissue, which might protect against AF. Biatrial pacing usually involves pacing simultaneously from a lead in the right atrial appendage to stimulate the right atrium and a lead in the coronary sinus to stimulate the left atrium [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-pacemakers-in-the-prevention-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Alternatively, two sites in the right atrium can be paced simultaneously (eg, the high right atrium and low on the interatrial septum near the coronary sinus ostium) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-pacemakers-in-the-prevention-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. </p><p>Possible mechanisms by which arrhythmia recurrence rates are lowered with dual-site pacing include a reduction in atrial conduction delay and a smaller increase in the width of the atrial electrogram caused by an early premature beat, measured at the right posterior interatrial septum.</p><p>The relative efficacy of dual- versus single-site (right atrial) pacing has been evaluated in several small series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-pacemakers-in-the-prevention-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/23-27\" class=\"abstract_t\">23-27</a>] and the larger and randomized DAPPAF trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-pacemakers-in-the-prevention-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. The following observations illustrate the range of findings:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a crossover study of 30 patients with drug-refractory AF, both types of pacing were beneficial; however, dual-site pacing in combination with an optimized final drug was associated with significant increases in the proportion of patients free of AF recurrence (89 versus 62 percent with single-site pacing) and in the mean arrhythmia-free interval (195 versus 143 days) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-pacemakers-in-the-prevention-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the DAPPAF trial, 118 patients with paroxysmal symptomatic AF and a bradyarrhythmic indication for pacing were randomly assigned to each of three pacing modes: right atrial, dual-site right atrial, and support (DDI or VDI) pacing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-pacemakers-in-the-prevention-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>]. There was no overall benefit from dual-site compared to single-site atrial pacing.

Compared with right atrial appendage pacing, interatrial septum pacing was associated with a reduction in the number of AF episodes and AF burden. However, the development of permanent AF and the prevalence of recurrent AF were similar between the two pacing modes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-pacemakers-in-the-prevention-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. &#160;</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H31853118\"><span class=\"h3\">Impact of site and rate of atrial pacing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The impact of the site of atrial pacing was evaluated in the SAFE study of 385 patients with paroxysmal AF and sick sinus syndrome with an indication for long-term pacing [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-pacemakers-in-the-prevention-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>]. Individuals were randomly assigned to pacing at the right atrial appendage or the right septum. These two groups were further stratified by whether a continuous overdrive pacing algorithm was &ldquo;on&rdquo; or &ldquo;off.&rdquo; (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Overdrive (antitachycardia) atrial pacing'</a> below.) After a mean follow-up of 3.1 years, there was no difference in the rate of occurrence of persistent AF between the two sites.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Overdrive (antitachycardia) atrial pacing</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The rationale for overdrive or antitachycardia pacing that predominates over intrinsic atrial activity is that triggering of AF might be reduced by affecting the pattern of atrial depolarization and suppressing atrial premature beats. Initial studies produced variable results [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-pacemakers-in-the-prevention-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. This was followed by the development of complex algorithms that keep the pacing rate slightly faster than the intrinsic atrial rate in an attempt to minimize the sudden rate change that occurs after premature beats. </p><p>Some combinations of proprietary pacing algorithms designed to both prevent AF by overdrive pacing and to pace-terminate AF at its onset have been shown to have a statistically significant positive impact on AF burden. However, their impact is clinically small, often leads to symptoms such as palpitations related to overdrive pacing, and should not be considered as a treatment option in patients who do not have a bradycardia indication for pacing. In addition, they do not compare to the efficacy of antiarrhythmic drug therapy or catheter ablation. We consider using this pacing modality in patients with frequent, symptomatic episodes of AF whose episodes have been difficult to manage with rate or rhythm control. (See <a href=\"#H355257795\" class=\"local\">'Patients without an indication for a pacemaker'</a> above.)</p><p>Some [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-pacemakers-in-the-prevention-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/30-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-33</a>], but not all [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-pacemakers-in-the-prevention-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>], of these algorithms appear to more effectively reduce the total number of episodes of AF or the burden of symptomatic AF compared to&nbsp;DDDR alone [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-pacemakers-in-the-prevention-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/30-33\" class=\"abstract_t\">30-33</a>]. We do not routinely use any of these algorithms for overdrive atrial pacing. </p><p>The following studies are representative:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>POT trial &ndash; The Prevention Or Termination trial studied the effect of antitachycardia pacing on AF burden when added to preventive pacing algorithms (PPA) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-pacemakers-in-the-prevention-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. The study consisted of 85 patients who received a DDDR (rate-adaptive dual-chamber pacemaker) with antitachycardia pacing (ATP) algorithms who had greater than 30 minutes per week of AF. They were randomly assigned either to PPA or to PPA with ATP for three months, and then they were crossed to the alternative therapy for the same amount of time with a one-month washout period. Both groups showed a significant decrease in AF burden at the end of the first period (64 versus 81 percent), but there was no further decrease in AF burden of the number of episodes when adding ATP to PPA.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>SAFARI trial &ndash; The Study of Atrial Fibrillation Reduction (SAFARI) was designed to determine the impact of preventive pacing algorithms on patients with pacing indications and a history of paroxysmal AF. The study randomized 240 patients to receive either continuous overdrive and triggered overdrive pacing therapies (PPTs) or standard pacing. The primary efficacy end point was post-randomization AF burden, defined as the average number of hours per day spent in atrial tachyarrhythmia during the longest period of at least 90 days between the 4- and 10-month visits. There was no difference in the development of permanent AF between the PPTs ON group (0 percent) compared with the OFF group (2.5 percent). Patients randomized to the PPTs ON group had a median reduction in AF burden to 0.08 <span class=\"nowrap\">hours/day</span> compared with no change in the OFF group [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-pacemakers-in-the-prevention-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>ADOPT-A trial &ndash; The randomized Atrial Dynamic Overdrive Pacing Trial (ADOPT-A) trial assessed the efficacy of a pacemaker algorithm designed to pace the atrium at rates slightly faster than intrinsic in patients with a history of symptomatic paroxysmal or persistent AF and an indication for dual chamber pacing. The primary end points of the study were symptomatic AF burden and adverse events. A total of 319 patients were randomized. The burden of symptomatic atrial arrhythmias (defined as AF, atrial flutter, and atrial tachyarrhythmias) was reduced by 26.5 percent, from 2.6 percent in the control group to 1.9 percent in the treatment group.

Of the 2451 pacemaker patients randomized, there was no difference in the annual rate of atrial tachyarrhythmia development (1.96 percent per year in patients randomized to receive atrial overdrive pacing versus 1.44 percent per year in control patients) and no difference in the combined end point of stroke, systemic embolism, myocardial infarction, death from vascular causes, or hospitalization for heart failure [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-pacemakers-in-the-prevention-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>MINERVA trial &ndash; This trial evaluated a novel atrial antitachycardia pacing feature (DDDRP) with or without managed ventricular pacing (DDDRP + managed ventricular pacing [MVP]) versus DDDR alone in patients with bradycardia and previous atrial arrhythmias [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-role-of-pacemakers-in-the-prevention-of-atrial-fibrillation/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].

An atrial sensing only (VDD) ICD lead is also available and may be useful in the diagnosis of AF in a patient with a single lead ICD. A stand-alone atrial defibrillator was previously evaluated but is no longer available due to the high risk of recurrent AF and the pain associated with shocks.
