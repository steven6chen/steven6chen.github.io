It is caused by abnormal growth of the thyroid gland, plus one or more growths called &quot;thyroid nodules.&quot; Thyroid nodules are round or oval-shaped growths in the thyroid gland (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F76248\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef76248 \">figure 1</a>). The thyroid gland is in the middle of the neck.</p><p>Thyroid nodules are common and not usually harmful to a person's health. But sometimes thyroid nodules are caused by a serious condition, such as cancer.</p><p>The thyroid gland makes a hormone called &quot;thyroid hormone.&quot; Most thyroid nodules do not change the amount of thyroid hormone in the body. But some thyroid nodules cause the thyroid gland to make too much thyroid hormone. If a multinodular goiter has this type of thyroid nodules, it can cause symptoms.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10725270\"><span class=\"h1\">What are the symptoms of a multinodular goiter?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people with a multinodular goiter do not have symptoms. The swelling might be found during an imaging test, such as an ultrasound, that is done for another reason. Or a blood test to check thyroid hormone levels might show that a person has too much thyroid hormone. Having too much thyroid hormone can be a sign of a multinodular goiter.</p><p>Some people with a multinodular goiter feel or see a lump in their neck. Or they have symptoms from having too much thyroid hormone, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling worried or upset, or having trouble sleeping</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Feeling weak or tired</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Losing weight without trying</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having a fast heartbeat</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Having frequent bowel movements</p><p/><p>If a multinodular goiter presses on the throat or airway, it can cause:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble breathing &ndash; Especially during physical activity, at night, or when reaching or bending</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Wheezing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Coughing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A choking feeling</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Trouble swallowing</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10725285\"><span class=\"h1\">Will I need tests?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Yes. Your doctor will want to make sure that the multinodular goiter is not going to harm your body. You need tests to find out if nodules in the goiter are causing your thyroid gland to make too much hormone. Your doctor will also check the nodules to see how big they are and if they need to be taken out.</p><p>Tests usually include blood tests and an imaging test of the thyroid called an ultrasound. This test uses sound waves to create a picture of the inside of your body.</p><p>Sometimes, people need more tests. These include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Fine needle aspiration &ndash; For this test, a doctor uses a thin needle to remove a small sample of tissue from one nodule in the goiter, usually the largest. He or she might take tissue from more than one nodule. Then, another doctor looks at the tissue under a microscope.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Thyroid scan &ndash; People get this test only if they have too much thyroid hormone in the body. For this test, a person gets a pill or a shot with a small amount of a radioactive substance. Then a special camera takes a picture of the thyroid gland. This test is not safe for women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10725302\"><span class=\"h1\">How is a multinodular goiter treated?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Many multinodular goiters do not need treatment. If the nodules are small and do not look harmful, your doctor might watch and wait to see if the swelling gets bigger or needs to be treated.</p><p>A multinodular goiter needs treatment if:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It causes the thyroid gland to make too much hormone</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It causes problems with breathing, swallowing, or other body functions &ndash; or is very large</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It contains cancer</p><p/><p>Treatments for multinodular goiter include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Antithyroid medicines &ndash; If your thyroid blood tests show that the thyroid gland is making too much thyroid hormone, doctors can use medicines such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methimazole-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">methimazole</a> (MMI) (brand name: Tapazole) and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=propylthiouracil-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">propylthiouracil</a> (also called &quot;PTU&quot;) to lower the amount of thyroid hormone it makes. These medicines control thyroid hormone levels until doctors can do other treatments.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Medicines to help with symptoms caused by too much thyroid hormone, such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=atenolol-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">atenolol</a> (brand name: Tenormin)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Surgery to remove the multinodular goiter</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Radioactive iodine &ndash; Radioactive iodine comes in a pill or liquid that you swallow. It has a small amount of radiation in it. The radiation treats the problem by destroying a lot of the thyroid gland, so it does not make so much hormone. Radioactive iodine is used only to treat nodules that make too much thyroid hormone. It is not safe for women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Injections of alcohol to shrink nodules, or laser treatment to destroy them. The alcohol used in this treatment is not the kind people drink.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10725317\"><span class=\"h1\">What if I want to get pregnant?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you want to get pregnant, talk with your doctor or nurse. He or she can make sure your multinodular goiter is not making too much thyroid hormone before you get pregnant.</p><p>Women who are pregnant should not be treated with radioactive iodine. This is because radioactive iodine can cause serious harm to a baby.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10725332\"><span class=\"h1\">More on this topic</span></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=thyroid-nodules-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Thyroid nodules (The Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperthyroidism-overactive-thyroid-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_basics\">Patient education: Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) (The Basics)</a></p><p><a href=\"topic.htm?path=thyroid-nodules-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Thyroid nodules (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=hyperthyroidism-overactive-thyroid-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) (Beyond the Basics)</a><br/><a href=\"topic.htm?path=antithyroid-drugs-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">Patient education: Antithyroid drugs (Beyond the Basics)</a></p></div><div id=\"reviewProcess\"><span>All topics are updated as new evidence becomes available and our <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/home/editorial-policy\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"policy policy_editorialpolicy\">peer review process</a> is complete.</span></div><div id=\"topicRetrievedDate\"><span class=\"emphasis\">This topic retrieved from UpToDate on: </span>Apr 03, 2018.</div><div id=\"disclaimer\">The content on the UpToDate website is not intended nor recommended as a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
