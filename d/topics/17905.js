Patients in the first group are considered to have pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), whereas patients in the remaining four groups are considered to have PH (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F66348\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66348 \">table 1</a>). When all five groups are discussed collectively, PH is generally used. We adhere to this nomenclature in the discussion that follows. The WHO classification system is described in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-and-prognosis-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification and prognosis of pulmonary hypertension in adults&quot;, section on 'Classification'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">BASELINE ASSESSMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The baseline severity of PH should be determined prior to the initiation of therapy. This assessment is essential because the response to therapy will be measured as the change from baseline. Functional impairment and hemodynamic derangement are the key determinants of disease severity:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The functional significance of the PH is determined by measuring exercise capacity. From the exercise capacity, the patient's World Health Organization (WHO) functional class can be determined (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F62080\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef62080 \">table 2</a>)&nbsp;[<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pulmonary artery systolic pressure and right ventricular function can be estimated by echocardiography, and then used to make a presumptive diagnosis of PH. Right heart catheterization must be performed to accurately measure the hemodynamic parameters and confirm that PH exists. However, right heart catheterization is often deferred until advanced therapy is indicated because it is an invasive procedure. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Advanced therapy'</a> below.)</p><p/><p>Once the severity of the patient's pulmonary hypertension has been determined, primary therapy can be considered.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">PRIMARY THERAPY FOR PH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary therapy refers to treatment that is directed at the underlying cause of the PH. It is warranted in nearly all patients with PH. The disease severity should be reassessed following primary therapy, in order to determine whether advanced therapy is indicated.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Group 1 PAH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) have idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH, formerly called primary pulmonary hypertension), hereditary PAH, or PAH due to diseases that localize to small pulmonary arterioles, such as connective tissue diseases, HIV infection, portal hypertension, congenital heart disease, schistosomiasis, and drug use (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F66348\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66348 \">table 1</a>).

(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-stable-chronic-obstructive-pulmonary-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of stable chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-idiopathic-pulmonary-fibrosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-obstructive-sleep-apnea-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of obstructive sleep apnea in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Oxygen is the only modality with proven mortality benefit in some patients with group 3 PH. This has been established by two large trials studying patients with COPD, the most common cause of group 3 PH:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A trial randomly assigned 87 patients with COPD, a history of right ventricular dysfunction, and a PaO2 below 60 mmHg to receive either oxygen therapy for 15 hours per day or no oxygen therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Oxygen therapy decreased five-year mortality (46 versus 67 percent), but the survival advantage did not appear until after 500 days of therapy. Pulmonary vascular resistance did not increase in the oxygen group, but increased in the group without oxygen (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F67353\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef67353 \">figure 1</a>).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The Nocturnal Oxygen Therapy Trial (NOTT) compared continuous (19 hours per day) to nocturnal (12 hours per day) oxygen administration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. The population included 203 patients with COPD and either a PaO2 below 55 mmHg or a PaO2 below 60 mmHg with coexisting polycythemia, leg edema, or cor pulmonale on the electrocardiogram. The three-year mortality rate was lower with continuous oxygen than nocturnal oxygen (22 versus 42 percent) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F82598\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef82598 \">figure 2</a>). Oxygen therapy was also associated with a slight reduction of pulmonary vascular resistance.</p><p/><p>Thus, continuous oxygen therapy improves survival in patients with COPD and a PaO2 below 55 mmHg. While the trial suggested seemingly mild effects on pulmonary hemodynamics, in our experience, some patients with chronic hypoxia experience a marked reduction in pulmonary artery pressure with continuous oxygen therapy. Predictors of a long-term response to continuous supplemental oxygen therapy include a decrease of the mean pulmonary artery pressure greater than 5 mmHg after 24 hours of 28 percent oxygen therapy and a high peak oxygen consumption (VO2) after symptom-limited exercise (&gt;6.5 <span class=\"nowrap\">cc/kg</span> per min as determined by a 30 second collection of expired gas in an airtight collection bag) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Group 4 PH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with group 4 PH have PH due to thromboembolic occlusion of the proximal or distal pulmonary vasculature (eg, chronic thromboembolic disease) (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F66348\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef66348 \">table 1</a>).

The value of anticoagulant therapy for group 4 PH is an extrapolation of the clinical evidence that anticoagulation prevents recurrent pulmonary embolism.

Perioperative mortality for this procedure is less than 10 percent when performed in selected centers and the hemodynamic response may be dramatic and sustained. Prior to proceeding with this invasive approach, a three-month period of anticoagulation is required and patients must remain severely incapacitated due to PH.

These therapies should be administered taking into consideration the underlying cause as well as the risks and benefits associated with each therapy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h3\">Diuretics</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with fluid retention from PH-related right ventricle failure (RV) may benefit from diuretics. [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. Diuretics diminish hepatic congestion, peripheral edema, and pleural effusions and may be of particular benefit in those in whom interventricular sepal deviation from elevated RV pressure impairs left ventricle output. </p><p>However, diuretics should be administered with caution. Since patients with PH are pre-load dependent, over-diuresis may result in under-filling of the RV, and a decline in RV stroke volume, thereby reducing left ventricle (LV) stroke volume resulting in systemic hypotension and sometimes shock. In addition, diuretics can be associated with arrhythmias induced by hypokalemia, and metabolic alkalosis (which can depress ventilation). </p><p>Most diuretic is administered orally in the chronic setting. However, diuresis may be more effective in the acute setting, when it can be given as a bolus dose or a continuous infusion (which may be better tolerated hemodynamically in those with borderline blood pressure). </p><p>Occasionally, the increased right ventricular pressure is so severe that diuretics are ineffective; in such cases, ultrafiltration may be beneficial. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Oxygen therapy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Continuous oxygen administration remains the cornerstone of therapy in patients with group 3 PH, as discussed above.

However, long-term data do not exist.</p><p>Oxygen should be considered for all patients with PH plus hypoxemia (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PULM%2F76543\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef76543 \">table 3</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/1,9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9-11</a>]. The flow of oxygen needed to correct hypoxemia should be determined by measurement of the oxygen saturation. Oxygen is generally administered at 1 to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">L/min</span> via nasal prongs and adjusted to maintain the oxygen saturation above 90 percent at rest and, if possible, with exercise and sleep [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

However, anticoagulation in patients with group 1 PAH is controversial. Studies that report outcomes associated with anticoagulation in patients with group 1 PAH are hampered by their methodologic limitations including retrospective design, high dropout rates, and variable practice among centers. Reflecting variable practice among centers are reports suggesting that following diagnosis, only 50 percent or less of those with group 1 PAH actually receive anticoagulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>]. In general, most experts agree that anticoagulation should be avoided in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc)-associated PAH due to a lack of benefit or potential harm. In contrast, experts disagree on whether or not patients with other forms of PAH should be anticoagulated since data to support administering or avoiding it are not helpful; in general anticoagulation has fallen out of favor in this population and we suggest that anticoagulant therapy be administered on a case-by-case basis according to the clinician's assessment of the risks and benefits. </p><p>Traditionally, many patients with group 1 PAH were anticoagulated, particularly those with idiopathic, hereditary, connective tissue disease (CTD)-associated- and drug-induced-PAH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/1,9-11,13,15,16\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,9-11,13,15,16</a>]. This practice was based upon the increased risk for intrapulmonary vascular thrombosis and venous thromboembolism, the observation that even a small thrombus can produce hemodynamic collapse in those with a compromised pulmonary vascular bed, and early studies that suggested a mortality benefit. However, evidence from registry-based studies have since reported conflicting outcomes in patients with idiopathic PAH (IPAH) and potential harm in those with SSc-PAH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. As examples:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In a 2006 systematic review of seven observational studies that evaluated the effect of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> in patients with group 1 PAH, five studies found a mortality benefit, while two did not show benefit [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the Comparative, Prospective Registry of Newly Initiated Therapies for Pulmonary Hypertension (COMPERA), anticoagulation was associated with an improved three-year survival in patients with IPAH compared with those who had other forms of PAH (mostly CTD-associated PAH; hazard ratio [HR]; 0.79; 95% CI 0.66-0.94) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>]. In a post-hoc analysis of those with SSc-PAH there was a statistically nonsignificant trend towards worse survival among those taking anticoagulants compared with patients not on anticoagulant therapy (three-year survival 62 versus 74 percent; HR, 1.82; 95% CI 0.94-3.54).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the Registry to Evaluate Early and Long-Term PAH Disease Management (REVEAL), there was no survival advantage associated with <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> use in patients with IPAH compared with matched warfarin-na&iuml;ve PAH controls, even when adjusted for disease severity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. However, a fifty percent increase in mortality (mostly from progressive disease) was reported in SSc-PAH patients receiving warfarin, when compared with PAH patients who were not anticoagulated.</p><p/><p>Limited experience with direct oral anticoagulants (eg, direct thrombin or factor Xa inhibitors) makes <a href=\"topic.htm?path=warfarin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">warfarin</a> the anticoagulant of choice, with a therapeutic goal of an international normalized ratio (INR) of approximately 2.0. Many centers in the US target a range of 1.5 to 2.5 with no bridging for temporary interruptions while many European centers target a range of 2.0 to 3.0 with bridging anticoagulant for interruptions. One retrospective study of 366 patients with PAH reported that 50 percent had had at least one of the three major risk factors for bioaccumulation of direct oral anticoagulants, such that therapy with these agents should be individualized and mainly be administered in those with proven indications [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].

As an example, a retrospective study of 198 patients with PH receiving anticoagulation reported major bleeding events in 23 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. Compared to IPAH and CTEPH, CTD-related PAH had a higher bleeding event rate (19 versus 5.4 and 2.4 events per 100 patient-years, respectively). This suggests that differences in bleeding risk may alter the risk-benefit ratio of anticoagulation in CTD-related PAH. Although registry studies report that most deaths in SSc patients on anticoagulants are due to progressive disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/13,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,14</a>], randomized studies are required to accurately assess whether increases in bleeding risk offset the potential benefit of anticoagulation in this population. &#160;</p><p>Patients with PH frequently have other risk factors for thromboembolism (eg, atrial fibrillation, severe left heart failure) that may warrant anticoagulation. Anticoagulation for these conditions should be assessed independently and are discussed separately.

Advanced therapy should NOT be administered to most patients with group 2 PH. </p><p>Two issues deserve emphasis before selecting a patient for advanced therapy. First, the evidence supporting advanced therapy comes primarily from studies that included patients with idiopathic PAH or scleroderma-related PAH such that extrapolation to other patient populations must be done with caution. In addition, the administration of advanced therapy to patients with other forms of pulmonary hypertension (eg, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis-related PAH) may be potentially harmful. Second, most clinicians agree that patients should be selected and advanced therapy administered only at specialized centers where clinicians are experienced in the evaluation and management of patients with PH.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H244328087\"><span class=\"h3\">Group 1 PAH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Advanced therapy is often needed for patients with group 1 PAH because there are no effective primary therapies. In addition, randomized trials show favorable outcomes in this population of PH patients (eg, improved survival, 6 minute walk distance, functional class, and pulmonary hemodynamics, as well as delayed time to disease progression) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H244328100\"><span class=\"h3\">Group 2 PH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>For most patients with group 2 PH (PH secondary to left heart disease), advanced therapy should be avoided because it may be harmful. However, there are a few situations in which advanced therapy may be considered for group 2 PH (eg, patients with persistent PH due to mitral valve disease who have undergone mitral valve replacement with normalization of left atrial pressure).</p><p>The potential harm of advanced therapy in this population of patients with PH was best illustrated by a trial that randomly assigned 471 patients with PH and severe left ventricular dysfunction to receive standard therapy with or without <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epoprostenol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epoprostenol</a> (a component of advanced therapy) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The trial was terminated early because the epoprostenol group had a nonstatistically significant increase in mortality at three months (30 versus 24 percent) and six months (48 versus 37 percent). Possible explanations for the detrimental impact of epoprostenol include its significant positive inotropic effect and the inability of a compromised left heart to handle the increased flow across a newly dilated pulmonary vascular bed [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. Similarly, in a small randomized trial of 63 patients with PH due to left-sided heart disease, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=macitentan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">macitentan</a> resulted in no difference in pulmonary hemodynamics, more fluid retention, and worsening of functional class compared with patients on placebo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H244328115\"><span class=\"h3\">Group 3 PH</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Advanced therapy is not approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for patients with group 3 PH (PH secondary to chronic lung disease or hypoxemia) and some guideline panels recommend against its use in this population, except in the context of a clinical trial [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. In general, trials have either shown no clinically significant benefit or raised safety concerns (eg, worsening hypoxemia, increased mortality) when advanced therapy is used in this population. As an example, one trial of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=riociguat-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">riociguat</a> (a guanylate cyclase stimulant) in patients <strong>with</strong> PH associated with idiopathic pneumonia (RISE-IIP) was terminated early because of increased adverse events and mortality in patients treated with riociguat [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/37,38\" class=\"abstract_t\">37,38</a>]. Similarly, in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis <strong>without</strong> associated PH, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ambrisentan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ambrisentan</a> was associated with increased risk for disease progression and hospitalizations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].

Vasoreactivity testing facilitates agent selection by identifying those who may respond to calcium channel blockers (CCBs), which are less expensive and have fewer side effects than other forms of advanced therapy. Patients with a negative vasoreactivity test may be candidates for advanced therapy with a prostanoid, endothelin receptor antagonist, phosphodiesterase 5 inhibitor, or soluble guanylate cyclase stimulant (non-CCBs).

Consultation with an expert is warranted in women with PAH due to the complexity of drug administration and potential fetal and maternal complications associated with PH itself and the delivery (eg, fetal hypoxia, acute cardiovascular collapse). </p><p>A retrospective review of 49 pregnant women with PH (30 had World Health Organization [WHO] group 1 PAH) from four major academic medical centers in the United States reported a mortality of 16 percent (eight women). Seven of the eight deaths occurred in women with group 1 PAH; six of whom had severe PH (defined as mean pulmonary artery pressure &ge;50 mmHg) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/131\" class=\"abstract_t\">131</a>]. Three deaths occurred following pregnancy termination procedures and five deaths occurred postpartum, four in those who delivered by caesarian section compared with one who delivered vaginally. There were no neonatal deaths. Seventy three percent of women with severe PH received advanced therapies for pulmonary hypertension including vasopressors, inotropes, pulmonary vasodilators, and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).</p><p>For women of childbearing age with known PAH, pregnancy should be avoided due to the risk of worsening pulmonary vascular hemodynamics. In addition, estrogen-containing contraceptives should be avoided. Surgical (patient or partner) methods of contraception are preferred but dual barrier contraception (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=progesterone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">progesterone</a> implanted intrauterine device) is an acceptable alternative.

Supplemental oxygen (2 to 4 L per minute) can also be administered to maintain oxygen saturations above 90 percent. Assessment of patients for air travel and the effects of high altitude are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=assessment-of-adult-patients-for-air-travel#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Assessment of adult patients for air travel&quot;, section on 'Pulmonary'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=traveling-with-oxygen-aboard-commercial-air-carriers\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Traveling with oxygen aboard commercial air carriers&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-altitude-illness-physiology-risk-factors-and-general-prevention\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;High altitude illness: Physiology, risk factors, and general prevention&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=high-altitude-air-travel-and-heart-disease\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;High altitude, air travel, and heart disease&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H167513279\"><span class=\"h2\">Patients requiring surgery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients with symptomatic pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular dysfunction, in particular those with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), are at high risk of cardiovascular collapse and death when undergoing anesthesia, mechanical ventilation, and major surgery, such that patients should avoid nonessential surgery. For those in whom surgery is necessary, preoperative medications for PAH should be continued without interruption. Perioperatively, patients should be managed by a multidisciplinary team that includes a cardiovascular anesthesiologist and PH expert with careful monitoring of fluid balance, oxygenation, blood pressure and heart rate. (See <a href=\"#H2328396332\" class=\"local\">'Surgical risk'</a> above.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H32\"><span class=\"h1\">FOLLOW-UP</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Patients should ideally be seen every three months (or more frequently) if they are receiving parenteral or combination therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>]. The same is true of patients who have advanced symptoms, right heart failure, or advanced hemodynamic abnormalities. Less ill patients should be seen every three to six months. Such frequent reassessment is necessary because of the complex nature of the disease and its treatments. Patient logistics may dictate alternative forms of follow-up, such as frequent telephone contact. </p><p>Follow-up visits should ideally include a thorough history to assess symptoms of right heart failure, exercise tolerance, and medication side effects; physical examination for signs of right heart failure; and resting and ambulatory oximetry. The frequency of follow-up testing with a brain natriuretic peptide (BNP), six minute walk test (6MWT), echocardiogram, and invasive hemodynamic assessment (right heart catheterization) should be determined on a case by case basis. We usually obtain a 6MWT at each visit and an echocardiogram every 12 months, or sooner if clinically indicated. The frequency of right heart catheterization (RHC) is made on a case-by-case basis. It is common to repeat a RHC early after the initiation of therapy (3, 6 or 12 months), when the patient deteriorates, and when combination therapy is initiated. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H33\"><span class=\"h1\">RIGHT TO LEFT SHUNT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Creation of a right to left shunt is not routinely recommended as therapy for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). However, in adults with severe symptomatic PAH, such a procedure can be considered. Procedures that have been used to generate a right to left shunt in adults with PAH are atrial septostomy and placement of a Potts shunt via a transcatheter approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/132-142\" class=\"abstract_t\">132-142</a>]. Importantly, a preexisting patent foreman ovale (PFO) or atrial septal defect (ASD) should never be percutaneously or surgically closed in a patient with significant PH.</p><p>Patients with severe PAH face significant morbidity and mortality due to progressive right heart failure. Severely high pulmonary vascular resistance leads to a reduction in left ventricular preload and consequently, systemic pressure, that can precipitate significant syncope and death (from obstructive shock). The purpose of right to left shunting is to avoid these undesirable outcomes by diverting blood flow to bypass the pulmonary vascular bed and enter the systemic circulation, thereby elevating systemic blood flow and maintaining tissue perfusion, albeit with less oxygenated blood. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3758506\"><span class=\"h2\">Atrial septostomy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Atrial septostomy is a right to left shunt that connects right and left atrial cavities. As a direct result of high right atrial pressures; the right-to-left shunting and consequent arterial desaturation that follow the procedure are offset in some patients by increased cardiac output and augmentation of systemic oxygen delivery by up to 27 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/132,135\" class=\"abstract_t\">132,135</a>]. However, procedure-related mortality may be as high as 15 to 20 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/132,138\" class=\"abstract_t\">132,138</a>]. It is difficult to predict which patients will benefit and which will deteriorate after this therapy.</p><p>Atrial septostomy may be considered in individuals with refractory severe pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and right heart failure, despite aggressive advanced therapy and maximal diuretic therapy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/139,143\" class=\"abstract_t\">139,143</a>]. It may also be considered in patients who have signs of impaired systemic blood flow (such as syncope) due to reduced left heart filling. Stepwise balloon dilatation is the procedure of choice [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Patients with the most advanced PAH appear more likely to die or get worse with atrial septostomy [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/139\" class=\"abstract_t\">139</a>]. This includes patients with markedly elevated mean right atrial pressure (eg, greater than 20 mmHg) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>], extremely low cardiac output, and a resting arterial oxyhemoglobin saturation less than 80 percent. In addition, older age and impaired renal function were associated with early adverse outcomes in one series [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/132\" class=\"abstract_t\">132</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3758513\"><span class=\"h2\">Transcatheter Potts shunt</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Surgical placement of a right to left shunt between the left pulmonary artery and the descending aorta (Potts shunt), has been described as a palliative measure in children with pulmonary artery hypertension (PAH). However, mortality from general anesthesia and surgery in adult patients with severe PAH is considerably higher. Placement of a transcatheter Potts shunt (TPS) under fluoroscopic guidance has been performed in one pilot study [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/142\" class=\"abstract_t\">142</a>]. TPS involves retrograde needle perforation of the aorta, with subsequent placement of a covered stent between the aorta and left pulmonary artery. Of four patients studied (18 to 47 years old), two died and two survived at four and ten months with symptomatic improvement. The use of TPS should be reserved for patients enrolled in clinical trials until further studies confirm its safety and efficacy in this population. &#160;</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H34\"><span class=\"h1\">TRANSPLANTATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Transplantation has been performed in patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) and is considered by some to be the final effective treatment for selected patients with IPAH [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/treatment-of-pulmonary-hypertension-in-adults/abstract/8,144,145\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,144,145</a>].

For patients with other forms of PAH, anticoagulation has largely fallen out of favor and we suggest administering it on a case-by-case-basis.

Advanced therapy is treatment that is directed at the PH itself, rather than the underlying cause of the PH. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Advanced therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Advanced therapy is widely accepted for many patients with group 1 PAH. In contrast, it must be considered on a case-by-case basis for patients with group 4 PH or group 5 PH, after carefully weighing the risks versus the benefits. Advanced therapy should NOT be administered to most patients with group 2 or group 3 PH. (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Patient selection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Advanced therapy should not be administered until a diagnostic right heart catheterization (RHC) and extensive investigations for the etiology of PH have been performed. Additionally, most patients with group 1 pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), in particular, those with idiopathic PAH, heritable PAH, and anorexigen-induced PAH, should also undergo vasoreactivity testing during RHC which facilitates agent selection.

Patients with WHO functional class I do not require therapy but should be monitored for disease progression and contributing causes of PH should be treated. For patients who are WHO functional class II or III, oral agents rather than intravenous prostanoids are preferred (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=5\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2B</a>). Classes of suitable agents include oral endothelin receptor antagonists (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=ambrisentan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ambrisentan</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bosentan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bosentan</a>, or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=macitentan-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">macitentan</a>), oral phosphodiesterase inhibitors (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=sildenafil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">sildenafil</a> or <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tadalafil-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tadalafil</a>), oral guanylate cyclase stimulants (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=riociguat-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">riociguat</a>), and oral prostacyclin pathway agonists (<a href=\"topic.htm?path=selexipag-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">selexipag</a>).
