Traditionally, this approach has used the Macdonald criteria, which rely upon measurement of areas of contrast enhancement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-postoperative-therapy-for-glioblastoma-and-anaplastic-astrocytoma/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>]. New criteria have been proposed by the Response Assessment in Neuro-Oncology (RANO) working group to address problems in assessing patients with pseudoprogression or in assessing progressive disease in patients with nonenhancing lesions [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-postoperative-therapy-for-glioblastoma-and-anaplastic-astrocytoma/abstract/80\" class=\"abstract_t\">80</a>].

Guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) recommend that a repeat magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) should be obtained in patients with a high-grade glioma approximately four weeks after completion of radiation therapy, then every two to four months for two to three years, and less frequently thereafter [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/initial-postoperative-therapy-for-glioblastoma-and-anaplastic-astrocytoma/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"PATIENT_INFORMATION\"><span class=\"h1\">INFORMATION FOR PATIENTS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>UpToDate offers two types of patient education materials, &quot;The Basics&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Basics.&quot; The Basics patient education pieces are written in plain language, at the 5<sup>th</sup> to 6<sup>th</sup> grade reading level, and they answer the four or five key questions a patient might have about a given condition. These articles are best for patients who want a general overview and who prefer short, easy-to-read materials. Beyond the Basics patient education pieces are longer, more sophisticated, and more detailed. These articles are written at the 10<sup>th</sup> to 12<sup>th</sup> grade reading level and are best for patients who want in-depth information and are comfortable with some medical jargon.</p><p>Here are the patient education articles that are relevant to this topic. We encourage you to print or e-mail these topics to your patients.

Although gross total resection is preferred whenever possible, subtotal resection or stereotactic biopsy alone may be required depending upon the location and extent of the tumor. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-presentation-initial-surgical-approach-and-prognosis-of-high-grade-gliomas\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical presentation, initial surgical approach, and prognosis of high-grade gliomas&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma, we recommend postoperative radiation therapy with concurrent and adjuvant <a href=\"topic.htm?path=temozolomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">temozolomide</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). We suggest treating with six cycles of adjuvant monthly temozolomide rather than a more prolonged course (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=6\" class=\"grade\">Grade 2C</a>). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-therapy-for-high-grade-gliomas\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation therapy for high-grade gliomas&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H4\" class=\"local\">'Glioblastoma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In addition to radiation and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=temozolomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">temozolomide</a>, we discuss the option of low-intensity alternating electric field therapy (TTFields), which has been shown to improve survival in a large randomized trial. Use of the device is encouraged in interested patients, although the requirement to carry a device and maintain a shaved scalp for the duration of treatment presents a potential burden that is not acceptable to all patients. (See <a href=\"#H1293676788\" class=\"local\">'Alternating electric fields'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma, we recommend <strong>not</strong> using <a href=\"topic.htm?path=bevacizumab-including-biosimilars-of-bevacizumab-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">bevacizumab</a> in combination with standard radiation and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=temozolomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">temozolomide</a> (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). This recommendation is based on the lack of proven survival benefit for bevacizumab when used as part of initial therapy and the increased risk of toxicity with combination therapy. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Bevacizumab'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For patients with newly diagnosed anaplastic astrocytoma, we recommend postoperative radiation therapy plus <a href=\"topic.htm?path=temozolomide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">temozolomide</a>, rather than either therapy alone (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H11\" class=\"local\">'Anaplastic astrocytoma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The use of postoperative radiation and chemotherapy in patients with grade II and grade III oligodendroglial tumors is discussed elsewhere.
