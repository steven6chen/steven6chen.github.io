The presence of these manifestations and their severity can be used to describe several different clinical patterns that often correspond to different underlying etiologies.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An acute nephritic syndrome pattern is associated with active urine sediment with red cells, white cells, granular and often red cell and other cellular casts, and a variable degree of proteinuria including nephrotic range proteinuria, and often elevated blood pressure. Histologic examination demonstrates inflammation. This pattern is most often seen in children with poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis, but may also be secondary to a membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis.

Patients with a nephrotic syndrome may have anasarca with ascites, and respiratory distress caused by pleural effusions. Patients with glomerulonephritis and nephrotic syndrome may have overlapping clinical findings.</p><p>Patients with secondary causes of glomerular disease often have nonrenal symptoms and signs (eg, fever, arthralgias, rash, and pulmonary hemorrhage) that are suggestive of a specific underlying systemic disease.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Urinalysis and urinary protein</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Testing of the urine is the most important noninvasive test in determining whether or not a child has glomerular disease, and distinguishes between the patterns of glomerular disease.

For example, a child with nephrotic range proteinuria and inactive urine sediment is likely to have idiopathic nephrotic syndrome. In this setting, an empirical course of corticosteroid therapy is a reasonable option, as more than 80 percent of patients will respond to this intervention.</p><p>However, children presenting with a different clinical pattern, such as active nephritis, require further evaluation to determine the underlying glomerular disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/evaluation-of-a-child-with-glomerular-disease/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. Patients with components of both nephritic and nephrotic syndromes are evaluated in a similar manner to those with nephritis because several of the glomerulonephritides may also present with nephrotic syndrome, whereas idiopathic nephrotic syndrome does not typically have an inflammatory component. In addition, patients who are suspected of having glomerular disease but don't fit either category are also included in the glomerulonephritis category, as they are likely to have a mild course of a glomerulonephritis. For example, children who present with recurrent gross hematuria after an upper respiratory infection without an active sediment or proteinuria may have a mild course of immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Glomerulonephritis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Glomerulonephritis represents a variety of disorders that are caused by immunologic injury that results in inflammation of the glomeruli.
