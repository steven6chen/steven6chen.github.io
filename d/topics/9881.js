LS usually occurs in postmenopausal women, although men, children, and premenopausal women may be affected. It can develop on any skin surface, but in women it most commonly occurs near the clitoris, on the labia (the inner and outer genital lips), and in the anal region (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F53704\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53704 \">figure 1</a>). In 15 to 20 percent of patients, LS lesions develop on other skin surfaces, such as the thighs, breasts, wrists, shoulders, neck, and even inside the mouth.</p><p>It is not clear exactly how many people have LS. Estimates for LS involving the female genitals vary from 1 in 30 older adult women seen in general gynecology offices to 1 in 300 to 1000 patients referred to dermatologists.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">LICHEN SCLEROSUS CAUSES AND RISK FACTORS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The cause of lichen sclerosus (LS) is not clear; healthcare providers suspect that a number of factors may be involved.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Genetic factors</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>LS seems to be more common in some families. People who are genetically predisposed to LS may develop symptoms after experiencing trauma, injury, or sexual abuse.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">Disorders of the immune system</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>LS in females may be an autoimmune disorder, in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks and injures the skin. People with LS are at greater risk of developing other autoimmune disorders, such as some types of thyroid disease, anemia, diabetes, alopecia areata, and vitiligo [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lichen-sclerosus-beyond-the-basics/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h2\">Infections</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Researchers have tried to identify an infectious organism as a cause of LS, but no clear data have shown that there is an infectious source [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lichen-sclerosus-beyond-the-basics/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. LS is not contagious.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">LICHEN SCLEROSUS (LS) SIGNS AND SYMPTOMS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Features of genital LS in women</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Some women with genital LS feel dull, painful discomfort in the vulva, while other women have no symptoms. The most common symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Vulvar itching </strong>&ndash; The most common symptom of LS is itching. It may be so severe that it interferes with sleep.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Anal itching, fissures, bleeding, and pain</strong> &ndash; (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=anal-fissure-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Anal fissure (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Painful sexual intercourse (dyspareunia)</strong> &ndash; This can occur as a result of repeated cracking of the skin (fissuring) or from narrowing of the vaginal opening due to scarring.</p><p/><p>Typically, women with genital LS have thin, white, wrinkled skin on the labia, often extending down and around the anus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F53704\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef53704 \">figure 1</a>). Purple-colored areas of bruising may be seen. Cracks (also known as fissures) may form in the skin in the area around the anus, the labia, and the clitoris. Relatively minor rubbing or sex may lead to bleeding due to the fragility of the involved skin.</p><p>If genital LS is not treated, it may progress and change the appearance of the genital area as the outer and inner lips of the vulva fuse (stick together) and cover the clitoris. The opening of the vagina can become narrowed, and cracks, fissures, and thickened, scarred skin in the genital and anal area can make sexual intercourse or genital examination painful. LS does not affect the inner reproductive organs, such as the vagina and uterus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Features of genital LS in men</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In men, LS may appear on the head of the penis. Men who develop LS are usually uncircumcised (they have not had the foreskin of the penis removed), and the foreskin can become tight, shrunken, and scarred over the head of the penis. Men with LS may also have problems pulling back the foreskin and may experience decreased sensation at the tip of the penis, painful erections, or problems with urination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lichen-sclerosus-beyond-the-basics/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H335825\"><span class=\"h2\">Features of LS in other areas</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>LS may also cause lesions to occur in areas outside the genitals, especially the upper body, breasts, and upper arms. These lesions tend to be white, flat or raised, and are not as itchy as the affected skin of the genitals and anus.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h1\">LICHEN SCLEROSUS DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Providers typically use the following methods to diagnose lichen sclerosus (LS).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">History and physical examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A medical history and physical examination of the vulvar and anal areas will be done, looking for the signs and symptoms of LS.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Biopsy</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>To confirm a suspected diagnosis of LS, a biopsy is recommended. A small piece of the affected skin will be removed and sent to a pathologist to be examined with a microscope.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h2\">Excluding other conditions</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tests may be done to exclude other conditions that could cause symptoms similar to those of LS, such as:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Lichen planus (a skin disease that can also cause itching and fusing of genital skin). Lichen planus can occur together with LS.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Low estrogen level (a lack of the hormone estrogen can rarely cause fusing of genital skin but is often the cause of painful intercourse). (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=vaginal-dryness-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Vaginal dryness (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>.) </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vitiligo (a disorder that can cause white skin patches similar to those of LS). Vitiligo can occur together with LS.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pemphigoid (a blistering skin disorder that also causes scarring of the vulva) is extremely rare.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Hemorrhoids (which can also cause cracks in the skin of the anus).</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h2\">LS and cancer</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Women with LS affecting the vulva are at a slightly increased risk for developing squamous cell skin cancer.</p><p>Diagnosing genital LS early, treating it effectively, and biopsying any abnormal areas may help to reduce the risk of developing or missing a diagnosis of skin cancer. A once-yearly examination of the skin of the vulva is recommended, and women should examine themselves regularly for lumps or sores that do not heal. A biopsy should be performed if there are areas that do not improve with treatment.</p><p>LS lesions outside the genital area do not have an increased risk of cancer. Men with LS that affects the skin of the penis have an increased risk of squamous cell skin cancer of the penis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2397610\"><span class=\"h2\">LS and painful sexual intercourse</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>LS can lead to constriction of the vaginal opening and pain during sexual intercourse. Women who experience pain during sex first require treatment to suppress any active disease. Once the disease is controlled, some clinicians may recommend an estrogen cream to help to soften the skin around the vaginal opening. Devices called vaginal dilators, which patients can use at home, also may be used to slowly stretch the skin.</p><p>Pain with intercourse can also occur from other causes. Patients who notice pain during intercourse should discuss their symptoms with their healthcare providers.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h1\">LICHEN SCLEROSUS TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The goals of treatment of lichen sclerosus (LS) are to relieve bothersome symptoms and to prevent the condition from worsening. A clinician may recommend medication for the physical symptoms, and may refer the patient for support and therapy for other issues associated with the condition, such as problems with sex.</p><p>All patients with genital LS, even those without noticeable symptoms, need to use medication on a regular and ongoing basis. Patients also should see a healthcare provider for reevaluation of the disease at least once or twice yearly.</p><p>Patients who are diagnosed with genital LS should talk to their clinician about:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The lifelong and potentially progressive nature of LS; appropriate treatment can stop the condition from worsening</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Ways to manage the condition</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The slightly increased risk of vulvar cancer and the need for ongoing monitoring</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>How to keep the genital area healthy and avoid scratching (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F58896\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef58896 \">table 1</a>)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Persistent pain with intercourse</p><p/><p>Depending on the severity of the condition, a healthcare provider may recommend one or more of the following treatments for genital LS:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Steroid ointments are recommended to reduce inflammation and itching. Strong steroid ointments (eg, clobetasol propionate) are the mainstay of treatment for genital LS and are effective in the majority of women. Initial treatment usually requires daily application of the ointment for one to three months to resolve the symptoms and reduce inflammation. After the initial course, most women require &quot;maintenance&quot; therapy with either less frequent application of the strong steroid ointment or a switch to a less potent steroid. Although there may be warnings on the product about the use of topical steroids on genital skin, it is important to use an adequate amount to bring the disease under control. The healthcare provider will provide guidance about the amount to use and frequency of application.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Steroid injections, especially if steroid ointments are not effective.</p><p/><p>Steroids are the treatment of choice for genital LS. Occasionally, medications called topical calcineurin inhibitors (eg, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tacrolimus-patient-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_patient\">tacrolimus</a> or pimecrolimus) are prescribed for patients who respond poorly to steroids or cannot tolerate steroid treatment.</p><p>Oral or topical tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) are sometimes recommended for vulvar pain that persists despite steroids. The dose of TCAs is typically much lower than that used for treating depression. It is believed that these drugs reduce pain perception when used in low doses, although it is not clear how TCAs work.</p><p>TCAs commonly used for pain management include amitriptyline, desipramine, and nortriptyline. Patients beginning TCAs commonly experience fatigue; this is not always an undesirable side effect, since it can help improve sleep when TCAs are taken in the evening. TCAs are generally started in low doses and increased gradually. Their full effect may not be seen for weeks to months.</p><p>Although it is not approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for this use, an oral medication called acitretin has also been used for the treatment of LS in some patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/lichen-sclerosus-beyond-the-basics/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]. Because it has many side effects, including a risk for liver damage, the drug is used primarily in patients who have not been helped by other treatments. Acitretin can cause severe birth defects, and women should not get pregnant during treatment or for three years after taking the drug. For this reason, acitretin usually is not recommended for women of child-bearing age.</p><p>For women with LS involving the genitalia, surgery may be used to treat consequences of the disease, such as abnormal fusion of tissues or scarring. It is important to continue medical treatment after surgery to prevent the recurrence of scarring.</p><p>Men who have genital LS are generally treated with circumcision, which removes the foreskin of the penis. After circumcision, LS does not usually come back.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h1\">WHAT TO EXPECT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The good news for patients who have been diagnosed with lichen sclerosus (LS) is that treatments such as topical steroid ointments are very effective. Thus, early treatment of LS with topical steroids can prevent scarring. Follow-up is important throughout the lifetime.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your healthcare provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your medical problem.</p><p>This article will be updated as needed on our website (<a href=\"http://www.uptodate.com/patients&amp;token=nygaOTnDuGxGrKiuwLIxjMIsa91xyzRx3QvmgfDh4FTTVfpiGy3XGWFyzaLmJXXU&amp;TOPIC_ID=8413\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.uptodate.com/patients</a>).
