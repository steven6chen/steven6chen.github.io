Because the viral polymerase lacks proofreading activity during reverse transcription of the pregenomic RNA, mutations are common accounting for genetic heterogeneity of HBV. The estimated mutation rate of the hepadnavirus genome is about 2 x 10(4) base <span class=\"nowrap\">substitutions/site/year,</span> about 100 times higher than that of other DNA viruses but about 100 to 1000 times lower than that of other RNA viruses [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-of-hepatitis-b-virus-genotypes/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>]. According to phylogenetic analyses, HBV can be classified into 10 genotypes (A to J) based upon an inter-group divergence of 8 percent or more in the complete nucleotide sequence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-of-hepatitis-b-virus-genotypes/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. There is growing evidence suggesting that HBV genotypes influence clinical outcomes, HBeAg seroconversion rates, mutational patterns in the precore and core promoter regions, and response to interferon therapy.

Considered together, they suggest that genotypes B and C are most common among those with chronic HBV, while genotype A is most common among those with acute HBV. The preponderance of genotype B and C among those with chronic infection reflects that chronic HBV in the United States is largely due to infection of individuals born elsewhere. </p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two studies from the Hepatitis B Research Network described the distribution of HBV genotypes in children and adults in the United States and Canada [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-of-hepatitis-b-virus-genotypes/abstract/9,10\" class=\"abstract_t\">9,10</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Among the 343 children and adolescents with chronic HBV (age range of 1 to 18&nbsp;years), the majority had HBV genotypes B or C (43 and 32 percent, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-of-hepatitis-b-virus-genotypes/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>].

HBV genotypes B and C accounted for 75 percent of the patients on the west coast, whereas genotypes A and D accounted for 74 percent of the patients in the south. There was a strong correlation between genotype and ethnicity. Genotype A was more common among whites and African Americans, and those with sexually acquired HBV infection while genotypes B and C were seen mostly in Asians, and those who acquired HBV through maternal-infant transmission. This study also underscored the impact of patient migration from Asia on the epidemiology of HBV genotypes in the United States.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One study evaluated 614 patients across six counties in the United States who developed acute HBV between 1999 and 2005 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-of-hepatitis-b-virus-genotypes/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. The majority (75 percent) were infected with HBV genotype A, while 18 percent were infected with genotype D. Genotype A infection was much more common among African Americans compared with Hispanics.

Genotype Ba (B2) arises from a recombination between HBV genotype B and C and has been found in many Asian countries, while genotype Bj (B1) (which does not appear to have arisen from recombination with genotype C) is found mainly in Japan [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-of-hepatitis-b-virus-genotypes/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Genotype Ba is more commonly associated with the presence of HBeAg although the role of HBV subgroups in determining clinical outcome remains to be studied [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-of-hepatitis-b-virus-genotypes/abstract/14,15\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15</a>]. A cross-sectional study from Japan found that fulminant hepatitis was associated with genotype Bj, lack of HBeAg, and high replication due to precore mutants [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-of-hepatitis-b-virus-genotypes/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. </p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>African subtype A1 is associated with a more rapid progression and a higher incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma than the European subtype A2 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-of-hepatitis-b-virus-genotypes/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].

Because of the preponderance of genotypes B and C in Asian countries, the studies have generally been restricted to comparisons of patients with these two genotypes (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F63279\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef63279 \">table 2</a>). Nevertheless, such comparisons provide important information on the relation between HBV genotype B and C and the rate of progression of liver disease, since the age at the onset of infection is presumed to be the same (perinatal period) in the vast majority of patients.</p><p>The earliest study done in Japan (involving 1744 patients) found that liver dysfunction (defined as abnormal aminotransferase levels) was observed less frequently in hepatitis B carriers with adw serotype (mainly genotype B) compared with those with adr serotype (mainly genotype C) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-of-hepatitis-b-virus-genotypes/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>]. Several subsequent studies confirmed that compared with genotype C, HBV genotype B is associated with less active liver disease and a slower rate of progression to cirrhosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-of-hepatitis-b-virus-genotypes/abstract/43-48\" class=\"abstract_t\">43-48</a>].</p><p>Many cross-sectional studies, mostly in Asian patients, found that the prevalence of HBeAg was higher in patients with genotype C than those with genotype B [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-of-hepatitis-b-virus-genotypes/abstract/11,42,43,46,47,49\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,42,43,46,47,49</a>]. In addition, several longitudinal follow-up studies showed that the cumulative rate of spontaneous HBeAg seroconversion was significantly higher in patients with genotype B compared with those with genotype C [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-of-hepatitis-b-virus-genotypes/abstract/46,49-53\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,49-53</a>]. Taken together, these studies showed that spontaneous HBeAg seroconversion occurred earlier and possibly at a higher rate in patients with HBV genotype B than those with genotype C. One study also found that genotype B patients were less likely to have abortive ALT flares before HBeAg seroconversion and more sustained biochemical remission after HBeAg seroconversion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-of-hepatitis-b-virus-genotypes/abstract/49\" class=\"abstract_t\">49</a>]. A longer duration of high levels of HBV replication may contribute to more active liver disease and, in turn, a higher rate of progression to cirrhosis among patients with HBV genotype C.</p><p>There is a paucity of data on the clinical course of patients with genotypes other than B and C. Genotypes A and D are prevalent in the Indian subcontinent. In one study genotype D was associated with more severe liver disease [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-of-hepatitis-b-virus-genotypes/abstract/54\" class=\"abstract_t\">54</a>]. However, this finding was not confirmed by another study from West India [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-of-hepatitis-b-virus-genotypes/abstract/55\" class=\"abstract_t\">55</a>]. Another study on 258 Spanish patients with chronic HBV infection (52 percent A, 35 percent D, 7 percent F) found that HBeAg seroconversion rates were similar in patients with genotypes A and D, but sustained biochemical and virological remission was more common in patients with genotype A who had HBeAg seroconversion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-of-hepatitis-b-virus-genotypes/abstract/56\" class=\"abstract_t\">56</a>]. HBsAg clearance occurred more often in patients with genotype A compared with genotype D, while deaths related to liver disease occurred more often in patients with genotype F. There are several limitations with this study: the number of patients with genotype F was very small and some patients received interferon therapy during the study period. A study from Germany found that among children with chronic HBV infection, genotype D was associated with higher HBV DNA levels than genotype A [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-of-hepatitis-b-virus-genotypes/abstract/57\" class=\"abstract_t\">57</a>].</p><p>There has been no published study comparing the rate of HBeAg seroconversion, activity of liver disease, and rate of progression to cirrhosis among patients with all known HBV genotypes. The lack of such studies is related to the preponderance of 1 or 2 HBV genotypes in most geographical regions. The finding of HBV genotypes A to G in the United States permits studies that compare the clinical course of HBV infection among patients with a wider spectrum of HBV genotypes. In one cross-sectional study of 694 patients in the United States, genotypes B and D were associated with a lower prevalence of HBeAg than genotype A, while genotype B was associated with a lower rate of hepatic decompensation compared with genotype A, C, or D [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-of-hepatitis-b-virus-genotypes/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. However, other factors such as differences in <span class=\"nowrap\">ethnic/racial</span> background, age at onset and duration of infection, and exposures to <span class=\"nowrap\">alcohol/environmental</span> toxins rather than HBV genotypes may have contributed to the differences in clinical manifestations.</p><p>A study of 1158 Alaska native persons with chronic HBV infection found that among 507 persons who were initially HBeAg positive, time to spontaneous HBeAg clearance was longest in those with genotype C compared with persons with genotypes A, B, D, or F. Furthermore, genotypes C and F were associated with a higher rate of HBeAg reversion after HBeAg clearance [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-of-hepatitis-b-virus-genotypes/abstract/58\" class=\"abstract_t\">58</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Hepatocellular carcinoma</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Studies on the relationship between HBV genotypes and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have yielded conflicting results. </p><p>Several observational studies in East Asia (Japan, China, Hong Kong) and a 2013 meta-analysis have suggested that patients infected with HBV genotype C were more likely to develop HCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-of-hepatitis-b-virus-genotypes/abstract/59-63\" class=\"abstract_t\">59-63</a>]. An analysis of a large cohort in Taiwan demonstrated that HBV genotype C and core promoter mutations were independently associated with increased risk of HCC, regardless of HBV DNA levels. Similarly, a study from the United States found that genotype C was associated with HCC in patients awaiting liver transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-of-hepatitis-b-virus-genotypes/abstract/64\" class=\"abstract_t\">64</a>]. Longitudinal follow-up studies confirmed that HBV genotype C and high serum HBV DNA were independent predictors of HCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-of-hepatitis-b-virus-genotypes/abstract/65-67\" class=\"abstract_t\">65-67</a>]. However, some studies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-of-hepatitis-b-virus-genotypes/abstract/46,50\" class=\"abstract_t\">46,50</a>] found that the lifetime risk of cirrhosis and HCC may not differ between patients with genotype B and C but adverse clinical outcomes occur later in patients with genotype B.</p><p>The major discrepant findings came from studies in Taiwan demonstrating that genotype B was more common than genotype C in younger (&lt;35 years old) non-cirrhotic patients with HCC [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-of-hepatitis-b-virus-genotypes/abstract/44,53,68\" class=\"abstract_t\">44,53,68</a>]. The discrepancy cannot be explained by different geographic distribution of genotype B subgroups (Ba and Bj) because studies from China and Hong Kong where the predominant subgroup is also Ba found that patients with genotype B had lower risk of HCC than those with genotype C.</p><p>Genotype A1, the subtype of genotype A found in Africa, is associated with a higher incidence of HCC than genotype A2, the subtype that is more common in Europe and the United States [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-of-hepatitis-b-virus-genotypes/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Chronicity of infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several reports raised suspicion that HBV genotypes vary in their ability to induce chronic infection.

One study reported that an outbreak of fulminant hepatitis in the United States was associated with genotype D [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-of-hepatitis-b-virus-genotypes/abstract/73\" class=\"abstract_t\">73</a>]. Unfortunately, this study lacked a proper control group to establish any causal link and other factors such as HCV coinfection, and heavy exposure to alcohol, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=acetaminophen-paracetamol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">acetaminophen</a>, and injected methamphetamine or cocaine rather than viral factors may be responsible for the fulminant course. A more comprehensive study by the United States Acute Liver Failure Study Group comparing 34 patients with HBV-related acute liver failure with a cohort of 530 patients with chronic HBV infection showed a higher prevalence of genotype D in the acute liver failure group (32 versus 16 percent) even after matching for race and HBeAg status [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/clinical-significance-of-hepatitis-b-virus-genotypes/abstract/74\" class=\"abstract_t\">74</a>].
