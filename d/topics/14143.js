Postnatal examination of the umbilical cord is reviewed separately.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gross-examination-of-the-placenta#H4\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gross examination of the placenta&quot;, section on 'Umbilical cord'</a>.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>(See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=the-placental-pathology-report#H2\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;The placental pathology report&quot;, section on 'Umbilical cord'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4216750840\"><span class=\"h1\">NORMAL UMBILICAL CORD ANATOMY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The umbilical cord contains two arteries and one vein surrounded by a gelatinous stroma (ie, Wharton's jelly) and covered by a single layer of amnion.</p><p>The left and right umbilical arteries are branches of the left and right internal iliac arteries, respectively. In the pelvis, the two arteries are separated by the bladder but then lie adjacent to each other at the umbilicus, where they exit the fetus and enter the umbilical cord (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F66765\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66765 \">figure 1</a>). The arteries follow a helical course around the umbilical vein until reaching the placenta, where they separate again and form the chorionic arteries on the surface of the placenta, with perforating branches to the underlying villi (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F59367\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef59367 \">figure 2</a>).</p><p>The confluence of chorionic veins at the chorionic plate form a single (&quot;left&quot;) umbilical vein, which courses through the cord to the umbilicus. Upon entering the fetal abdomen, it runs cephalad until it enters the liver, where it anastomoses with the portal sinus (ie, confluence of portal veins) and the ductus venosus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F66765\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef66765 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-umbilical-cord-abnormalities/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. A &quot;right&quot; umbilical vein is present very early in embryogenesis and then usually degenerates. Rarely, it persists as the only umbilical vein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-umbilical-cord-abnormalities/abstract/2,3\" class=\"abstract_t\">2,3</a>] or as a fourth umbilical vessel. (See <a href=\"#H22646128\" class=\"local\">'Supernumerary vessels'</a> below.)</p><p>After birth, the intra-abdominal portions of the umbilical vessels degenerate; the umbilical arteries become the lateral ligaments of the bladder and the umbilical vein develops into the round ligament of the liver.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22646020\"><span class=\"h1\">ULTRASOUND EXAMINATION OF THE UMBILICAL CORD</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H255325453\"><span class=\"h2\">Basic second- and third-trimester examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The American Institute of Ultrasound in Medicine practice parameter for obstetric ultrasound examination includes imaging the umbilical cord to determine the number of vessels as a standard component of the second- and third-trimester ultrasound examination [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-umbilical-cord-abnormalities/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The two arteries and vein can be seen clearly in both the transverse and longitudinal planes using conventional two-dimensional imaging techniques (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F66628\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef66628 \">image 1</a>). The umbilical arteries have smaller diameters than the vein and usually loop around it. Color Doppler improves visualization of the umbilical vessels; three-dimensional imaging techniques may also be used to enhance image quality [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-umbilical-cord-abnormalities/abstract/5-10\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-10</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H967321815\"><span class=\"h2\">Expanded second- and third-trimester examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The author performs a more extensive examination that includes assessment of the fetal and placental insertion sites, helical pattern of the umbilical arteries, and amount of Wharton's jelly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-umbilical-cord-abnormalities/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. The author also routinely uses color Doppler ultrasound to identify the intra-abdominal portion of the umbilical arteries as a screening and diagnostic technique for single umbilical artery. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=single-umbilical-artery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Single umbilical artery&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Although this expanded assessment is not the standard of care in most ultrasound departments, the author believes it is useful because a higher risk for adverse perinatal outcome has been associated with specific characteristics of the umbilical cord, such as thinness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-umbilical-cord-abnormalities/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], velamentous insertion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-umbilical-cord-abnormalities/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], and abnormal coiling [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-umbilical-cord-abnormalities/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. Other cord abnormalities, such as cysts and masses, may be noted incidentally during the expanded examination and also may have an adverse effect on pregnancy outcome.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1018350323\"><span class=\"h2\">First-trimester examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The umbilical cord can be visualized sonographically from the eighth gestational week. In the first trimester, the cord is usually coiled and approximately the same length as the crown-rump length (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F60884\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef60884 \">image 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-umbilical-cord-abnormalities/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>]. Determination of the number of vessels is not possible by direct examination; however, it is possible to visualize the paravesical umbilical vessels with color Doppler ultrasound in the axial view of the fetal pelvis in the late first trimester.</p><p>Before the 12<sup>th</sup> gestational week, the fetal insertion often appears bulky due to normal physiological midgut herniation of intestinal loops into the cord [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-umbilical-cord-abnormalities/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]. Herniation after 11 weeks of gestation is not normal and suggests an anterior abdominal wall defect. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=gastroschisis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Gastroschisis&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=omphalocele\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Omphalocele&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The placental insertion site can be easily identified, especially if color flow imaging is used, allowing the diagnosis of marginal and velamentous insertion in early pregnancy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=velamentous-umbilical-cord-insertion-and-vasa-previa\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Velamentous umbilical cord insertion and vasa previa&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22646034\"><span class=\"h1\">VASCULAR ABNORMALITIES</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22646042\"><span class=\"h2\">Single umbilical artery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>In the second and third trimesters, the primary goal of ultrasound examination of the umbilical cord is to determine the number of vessels. A two-vessel cord on transverse and longitudinal views of a free loop suggests a single umbilical artery. Visualization of one artery going around the fetal bladder instead of one artery on each side of the bladder supports the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=single-umbilical-artery\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Single umbilical artery&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22646078\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypoplasia of one umbilical artery</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypoplasia of one umbilical artery is a variant of single umbilical artery (SUA) in which both arteries are present, but with a gross disparity in their size. The hypoplastic but functional artery can occasionally be detected prenatally by ultrasound [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-umbilical-cord-abnormalities/abstract/17-23\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-23</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22646107\"><span class=\"h3\">Prenatal diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The prenatal diagnosis of a hypoplastic umbilical artery is based upon identification of all of the following [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-umbilical-cord-abnormalities/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Two patent umbilical arteries</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>One artery that is smaller than the other (at least 50 percent smaller)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Discordant umbilical artery flow velocity waveforms between the arteries</p><p/><p>Size discordancy is best appreciated in a magnified cross-sectional view of the umbilical cord [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-umbilical-cord-abnormalities/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. There is no universal standard definition of discordancy; differences in arterial diameter of 1 to 3 mm between arteries have been described and occur in up to 2 percent of pregnancies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-umbilical-cord-abnormalities/abstract/17,20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,20,21</a>]. The prevalence of discordancy is much lower if discordancy is defined as &gt;50 percent difference between arterial diameters. Using this definition, only 12 cases of hypoplastic umbilical artery were identified among 31,000 consecutive second- and third-trimester ultrasound scans [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-umbilical-cord-abnormalities/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. The low prevalence (0.04 percent) in this series was probably the result of using the very strict definition of hypoplastic umbilical artery and the inclusion of many early second-trimester pregnancies. The detection of marked discordancy between umbilical arteries is difficult to document before 20 weeks due to the small size of the arteries early in gestation.</p><p>Color Doppler ultrasound is used to confirm flow within the hypoplastic artery (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F52677\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef52677 \">image 3</a>), since absence of flow suggests an atrophic nonfunctional artery. Doppler is also used to document artery flow velocity waveforms, which are discordant when one artery is hypoplastic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-umbilical-cord-abnormalities/abstract/17,18\" class=\"abstract_t\">17,18</a>]. The resistance index is almost always higher in the smaller artery, and there may be absent end-diastolic flow.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22646114\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical significance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical significance of hypoplastic umbilical artery has not been clearly established. An increased risk of adverse pregnancy outcome has been reported as well as associations with maternal diabetes mellitus, polyhydramnios, fetal growth restriction, congenital anomalies, abnormal insertion of the umbilical cord, and placental abnormalities [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-umbilical-cord-abnormalities/abstract/17-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-22</a>]. Among 39 prenatally diagnosed cases of hypoplastic umbilical artery, seven fetuses (18 percent) had associated anomalies, including three cases of trisomy 18 and one case each of biliary atresia, hydronephrosis and duplex collecting system, agenesis of the corpus callosum and kyphoscoliosis, and tetralogy of Fallot [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-umbilical-cord-abnormalities/abstract/17-22\" class=\"abstract_t\">17-22</a>]. The high prevalence of associated structural anomalies in these reports should be interpreted with caution because most cases of hypoplastic umbilical artery were diagnosed in a high-risk population.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22646121\"><span class=\"h3\">Management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A thorough examination of fetal anatomy and both cord insertion sites should be performed to look for additional abnormalities. The author suggests ultrasound examination for fetal growth and assessment of amniotic fluid at 28 and 34 weeks. This approach is based on the limited clinical experience obtained from the few case reports and small series reported in the literature.</p><p>At any follow-up ultrasound examination, Doppler flow should be measured in both umbilical arteries. Clinical management should be based on the Doppler findings of the normal diameter artery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1580325722\"><span class=\"h4\">Postnatal confirmation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Constriction of the umbilical arteries after delivery makes the diagnosis difficult to document by visual examination postnatally.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22646128\"><span class=\"h2\">Supernumerary vessels</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common type of multivessel cord contains two veins and two arteries. The extra vein has been attributed to persistence of the extracorporeal portion of the right umbilical vein [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-umbilical-cord-abnormalities/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>] but could also represent an abnormal splitting of an umbilical vessel in the third to fifth week of development.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3165029216\"><span class=\"h3\">Prenatal diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prenatal diagnosis is based on visualization of more than three blood vessels in the umbilical cord (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F65418\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef65418 \">image 4</a>).</p><p>Misdiagnosis of a multivessel cord can occur when the transverse view of the cord is through a false knot and includes loops of the same vessel. This also accounts for some four-vessel cords in histological sections.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2611849474\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical significance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The clinical significance of supernumerary vessels has not been clearly established. More than three vessels in the umbilical cord is most common in conjoined twins and is an ultrasound landmark for diagnosis of thoracopagus and omphalopagus twins, who share the same cord [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-umbilical-cord-abnormalities/abstract/25,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">25,26</a>]. In the only four prenatally detected cases in singletons, a four-vessel cord was associated with holoprosencephaly and polyhydramnios in one case [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-umbilical-cord-abnormalities/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>] and was an isolated finding in a normal fetus in the other three cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-umbilical-cord-abnormalities/abstract/24,27,28\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,27,28</a>].</p><p>A four-vessel cord has been noted in normal neonates [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-umbilical-cord-abnormalities/abstract/29-31\" class=\"abstract_t\">29-31</a>] but also in neonates with multiple and different congenital anomalies (eg, trisomy 18, heterotaxy syndrome, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, anterior chest wall defect plus bilateral cleft lip and palate) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-umbilical-cord-abnormalities/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. In one case, four vessels (2 arteries, 2 veins) were found in the cord of a macerated stillborn with multiple anomalies, including ectopia cordis, bifid liver, and bilateral cleft lip and palate [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-umbilical-cord-abnormalities/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3150154983\"><span class=\"h3\">Management</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If a multivessel cord is identified, a thorough examination of fetal anatomy should be performed to look for associated anomalies and to exclude conjoined twins in twin pregnancies.

Both are rare. In 184 autopsies of dead newborns, stillborn infants, and aborted fetuses (mostly with congenital malformations), varix of the umbilical vein was observed in 7 of the 57 cases with cord malformations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-umbilical-cord-abnormalities/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>]; the incidence in an unselected population is unknown.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H312691693\"><span class=\"h3\">Prenatal diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of aneurysm or varix should be suspected when focal dilation is observed in any of the umbilical vessels. Umbilical vein varix typically occurs in the intra-abdominal portion of the vein but can occur in the intra-amniotic portion as well (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F55016\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef55016 \">picture 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-umbilical-cord-abnormalities/abstract/34-38\" class=\"abstract_t\">34-38</a>]. Color Doppler (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F78214\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef78214 \">image 5</a>) and color flow imaging are useful in differential diagnosis by demonstrating whether there is arterial, nonpulsatile, or turbulent flow within the mass. With an aneurysm, the feeding vessel is arterial and, therefore, pulsatile flow is obtained when spectral analysis is applied to the vascular mass. With a varix, the incoming vessel is venous and the flow within the vascular mass is non-pulsatile or turbulent.</p><p>Differential diagnosis includes all types of cystic masses of the cord, including pseudocyst or true cyst. However, color Doppler ultrasound can easily differentiate a cystic from a vascular mass by determining absence or presence of blood flow signal within the mass, respectively.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2972783765\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical significance</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aneurysm and varix have been associated with fetal demise [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-umbilical-cord-abnormalities/abstract/33,39-44\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,39-44</a>]. Varix of the intra-amniotic segment of the umbilical vein can rupture, resulting in intra-amniotic hemorrhage through the amniotic sheath, with fetal exsanguination leading to fetal death [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-umbilical-cord-abnormalities/abstract/45\" class=\"abstract_t\">45</a>].

However, this communication is not always present and only rarely detected prenatally. Embryologically, the allantois is the only vestigial remnant located at the center of the umbilical cord and is surrounded by the umbilical vessels. If an allantoic cyst develops because of retrograde micturition into the umbilical cord, the umbilical vessels separate and surround the cyst (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F58326\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef58326 \">figure 3</a>), which can be seen with color Doppler (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=OBGYN%2F56599\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef56599 \">picture 4</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-umbilical-cord-abnormalities/abstract/68,69\" class=\"abstract_t\">68,69</a>].

The pathogenesis is unknown. One theory is that they represent an area of focal edema. In these cases, increased vascular pressure within the umbilical-placental circulation increases umbilical cord hydrostatic pressure, which favors transfer of fluid into Wharton's jelly [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-umbilical-cord-abnormalities/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].

In one review of 13 prenatally diagnosed umbilical cord cystic lesions histologically proven to be pseudocyst, eight were associated with aneuploidy and two were euploid with other anomalies [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-umbilical-cord-abnormalities/abstract/83\" class=\"abstract_t\">83</a>]. In the largest series of umbilical cord pseudocysts in a high-risk population, chromosomal abnormalities were noted in seven of 13 cases, and three additional euploid fetuses had structural defects, including one each of cystic hygroma, omphalocele, and acrania [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-umbilical-cord-abnormalities/abstract/79\" class=\"abstract_t\">79</a>].</p><p>If the pseudocyst appears to be an isolated finding, the risk of adverse pregnancy outcome is probably not increased, although few such cases have been reported [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-umbilical-cord-abnormalities/abstract/84\" class=\"abstract_t\">84</a>].

One theory is that they represent embryonic remnants such as an allantoic or omphalomesenteric cyst, amniotic inclusion cyst, or mucoid degeneration or edema of the Wharton's jelly (pseudocysts). In the only case in which sonographic-histopathologic correlation is available, an amniotic inclusion cyst and adjacent mucoid degeneration of Wharton's jelly were found, suggesting first-trimester umbilical cord cysts could represent either entity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-umbilical-cord-abnormalities/abstract/88\" class=\"abstract_t\">88</a>]. The rapid resolution of the cysts suggests they are pseudocysts rather than true cysts. They are always located lateral to the umbilical vessels, which also suggests that they are pseudocysts rather than a cystic component of embryologic remnants. Since the formation of these cysts is coincidental with both the onset of umbilical cord coiling and formation of the physiological midgut hernia, these developmental phenomena could increase hydrostatic pressure within the umbilical vessels, favoring exudation of water into Wharton's jelly and formation of pseudocysts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-umbilical-cord-abnormalities/abstract/76\" class=\"abstract_t\">76</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22646339\"><span class=\"h3\">Prenatal diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Prenatal diagnosis is based on observation of a round, thin-walled anechoic structure in the amniotic cavity in close approximation to the umbilical cord and separate from the fetal pole and physiologic hernia.

A two-vessel cord on transverse and longitudinal views of a free loop suggests a single umbilical artery. Visualization of one artery going around the fetal bladder instead of one artery on each side of the bladder supports the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"#H22646042\" class=\"local\">'Single umbilical artery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Size and flow discordancy between umbilical arteries in a three-vessel cord suggests the diagnosis of hypoplastic umbilical artery. (See <a href=\"#H22646078\" class=\"local\">'Hypoplasia of one umbilical artery'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of more than three vessels in the umbilical cord is rare in singleton fetuses and neonates, but it is a common finding in conjoined twins. (See <a href=\"#H22646128\" class=\"local\">'Supernumerary vessels'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Aneurysm and varix represent anechoic focal dilatations of the umbilical artery and vein, respectively. Spontaneous hemorrhage and thrombosis can occur and can be lethal. (See <a href=\"#H22646172\" class=\"local\">'Aneurysm and varix'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An allantoic cyst is always in close relationship with the fetal anterior abdominal wall and can be mistaken for an anterior abdominal wall defect. The author monitors the size of these cysts and perform color Doppler velocimetry of the umbilical artery because rapidly-increasing cyst size may compromise fetal blood flow. (See <a href=\"#H22646246\" class=\"local\">'True cysts'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Umbilical cord pseudocysts represent focal cystic degeneration of the Wharton's jelly or localized cord edema. They are rare, but more common than true cysts, and they have been associated with fetal chromosomal defects and other congenital anomalies, particularly omphalocele. (See <a href=\"#H22646282\" class=\"local\">'Pseudocysts'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>First-trimester pregnancies with multiple cord cysts appear to have a poorer prognosis than single cysts. (See <a href=\"#H22646282\" class=\"local\">'Pseudocysts'</a> above and <a href=\"#H22646318\" class=\"local\">'First-trimester umbilical cord cyst'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Cord hematomas may be iatrogenic or spontaneous. They appear as solid masses of variable shape and size in close relation to the umbilical cord or have a variable appearance, depending on the time elapsed between the bleeding and sonographic evaluation. (See <a href=\"#H22646449\" class=\"local\">'Hematoma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1059746226\"><span class=\"h1\">ACKNOWLEDGMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The editorial staff at UpToDate would like to acknowledge Neil J Sebire, FRCP, who contributed to an earlier version of this topic review.</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/prenatal-diagnosis-and-management-of-umbilical-cord-abnormalities/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Mavrides E, Moscoso G, Carvalho JS, et al.
