Many subtypes of primary aldosteronism have been described since Conn's original report of the aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA) in 1954 [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-clinical-features-of-primary-aldosteronism/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>].</p><p>The most frequent causes of primary aldosteronism include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Bilateral idiopathic hyperaldosteronism (or idiopathic hyperplasia [IHA], 60 to 70 percent)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unilateral APAs (30 to 40 percent)</p><p/><p>Less common forms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unilateral hyperplasia or primary adrenal hyperplasia (caused by micronodular or macronodular hyperplasia of the zona glomerulosa of predominantly one adrenal gland).

The primary effect of aldosterone is to increase the number of open sodium channels in the luminal membrane of the principal cells in the cortical collecting tubule, leading to increased sodium reabsorption [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-clinical-features-of-primary-aldosteronism/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. The ensuing loss of cationic sodium makes the lumen electronegative, thereby creating an electrical gradient that favors the secretion of cellular potassium into the lumen through potassium channels in the luminal membrane (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F60693\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef60693 \">figure 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-clinical-features-of-primary-aldosteronism/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p>Although aldosterone initially induces sodium and water retention, this is followed within a few days by a spontaneous diuresis (called aldosterone escape) that returns excretion to the level of intake and partially lowers the extracellular fluid volume toward normal (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=NEPH%2F62044\" class=\"graphic graphic_figure graphicRef62044 \">figure 2</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-clinical-features-of-primary-aldosteronism/abstract/9-11\" class=\"abstract_t\">9-11</a>]. This response is induced by the volume expansion as escape typically occurs in humans after a weight gain of approximately 3 kg [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-clinical-features-of-primary-aldosteronism/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. The mechanisms responsible for the escape phenomenon are incompletely understood, but at least three factors may be important: increased secretion of <strong>atrial natriuretic peptide</strong> (ANP) induced by the hypervolemia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-clinical-features-of-primary-aldosteronism/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>], decreased abundance of the thiazide-sensitive sodium-chloride (Na-Cl) cotransporter that mediates sodium reabsorption in the distal tubule [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-clinical-features-of-primary-aldosteronism/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>], and <strong>pressure natriuresis</strong> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-clinical-features-of-primary-aldosteronism/abstract/11,14\" class=\"abstract_t\">11,14</a>]. In contrast, there appears to be no change in the abundance of the aldosterone-sensitive collecting tubule sodium channel (ENaC) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-clinical-features-of-primary-aldosteronism/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>Similar considerations apply to hypokalemia. The potassium-wasting effect of excess aldosterone is counterbalanced by the potassium-retaining effect of hypokalemia itself. As a result, the plasma potassium concentration stabilizes at a lower level, but progressive hypokalemia does not occur unless some other factor is added, such as increased aldosterone production or the use of diuretic therapy. The mechanisms by which hypokalemia limits further potassium wasting are discussed elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=causes-of-hypokalemia-in-adults#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Causes of hypokalemia in adults&quot;, section on 'Increased urinary losses'</a>.)</p><p>With both sodium and potassium handling, a new steady state is established in which the extracellular fluid volume and plasma potassium concentration are stable, although respectively increased and decreased because of the initial effects of aldosterone. In the steady state, both urinary sodium and potassium excretion are roughly equal to dietary intake, similar to that in normal subjects. Similar principles apply to the administration of diuretics as a new steady state is achieved within two to three weeks.

In one study, <em>CACNA1D</em> mutations were identified in 11 percent of aldosteronomas and were exclusive of <em>KCNJ5</em> mutations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-clinical-features-of-primary-aldosteronism/abstract/24\" class=\"abstract_t\">24</a>]; patients carrying these mutations had smaller tumors and were older than those with <em>KCNJ5</em> mutations.

The role of aberrant hormone receptors in adrenal disease is reviewed separately.

All three had heterozygous activating mutations of <em>CTNNB1</em> and large overexpression of aberrant <span class=\"nowrap\">LH/hCG</span> and GnRH receptors (100-fold higher than in other APAs). This suggests that <em>CTNNB1 </em>mutations stimulate Wnt activation and cause adrenocortical cells to de-differentiate toward their common adrenal-gonadal precursor cell type. It is thought that the high levels of endogenous hCG during pregnancy and of GnRH and LH after menopause led to the identification of APAs in these patients.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2712374188\"><span class=\"h2\">Idiopathic hyperplasia</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The underlying pathophysiology of increased secretion of aldosterone by the zona glomerulosa in patients with bilateral idiopathic hyperaldosteronism (or idiopathic hyperplasia [IHA], occasionally unilateral [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-clinical-features-of-primary-aldosteronism/abstract/30\" class=\"abstract_t\">30</a>]) is still incompletely understood. An aldosterone secretory factor has not been identified. Although angiotensin II adrenal hypersensitivity in patients with IHA has been recognized for many years [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-clinical-features-of-primary-aldosteronism/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>], the hyperaldosteronism in patients with IHA is not reversed with angiotensin II inhibitors. Thus, the driving factor for aldosterone hypersecretion in IHA remains unexplained. Genetic studies may provide clues to understanding the genetic susceptibility to bilateral idiopathic adrenal hyperplasia [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-clinical-features-of-primary-aldosteronism/abstract/32\" class=\"abstract_t\">32</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H1381750000\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL FEATURES</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Primary and nonsuppressible hypersecretion of aldosterone is an increasingly recognized but still underdiagnosed cause of hypertension. The classic presenting signs of primary aldosteronism are hypertension and hypokalemia, but potassium levels are frequently normal in modern-day series of primary aldosteronism. In general, when compared with patients with idiopathic hyperplasia (IHA), patients with an aldosterone-producing adenoma (APA) tend to have more severe hypertension and are more frequently recognized to be hypokalemic. However, these clinical findings do not reliably distinguish between APA and IHA.</p><p>Hyperaldosteronism exerts deleterious cardiovascular effects independent of the plasma potassium concentration. The overall treatment goal in patients with primary aldosteronism is to prevent the adverse outcomes associated with excess aldosterone, including hypertension, hypokalemia, renal toxicity, and cardiovascular damage. (See <a href=\"#H3359365118\" class=\"local\">'Renal effects'</a> below and <a href=\"#H3485804445\" class=\"local\">'Cardiovascular risk'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2916345992\"><span class=\"h2\">Hypertension</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Hypertension is the major clinical finding in primary aldosteronism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-clinical-features-of-primary-aldosteronism/abstract/2-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">2-5</a>]. The elevation in blood pressure is dependent upon the mild volume expansion that occurs, being prevented in animals and effectively treated in humans by dietary sodium restriction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-clinical-features-of-primary-aldosteronism/abstract/33,34\" class=\"abstract_t\">33,34</a>]. Persistent hypervolemia also leads to an increase in systemic vascular resistance that helps to perpetuate the hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-clinical-features-of-primary-aldosteronism/abstract/33\" class=\"abstract_t\">33</a>].</p><p>In addition to promoting the development of hypertension, hypervolemia is responsible for another characteristic finding in primary aldosteronism: marked suppression of renin release, leading to a very low plasma renin activity and plasma renin concentration [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-clinical-features-of-primary-aldosteronism/abstract/3-5\" class=\"abstract_t\">3-5</a>]. The finding of suppressed renin measurements is of diagnostic importance in distinguishing primary from secondary, hyperreninemic forms of hyperaldosteronism, as occur with renovascular hypertension, coarctation of the aorta, renin-secreting neoplasms, or diuretic therapy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-primary-aldosteronism\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of primary aldosteronism&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The blood pressure in primary aldosteronism is often substantially elevated. In one series, as an example, the mean blood pressure was <span class=\"nowrap\">184/112</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">161/105</span> mmHg in patients with an adrenal adenoma and hyperplasia, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-clinical-features-of-primary-aldosteronism/abstract/35\" class=\"abstract_t\">35</a>]. Despite these high blood pressure levels, malignant hypertension is a rare occurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-clinical-features-of-primary-aldosteronism/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].</p><p>Primary aldosteronism may be associated with resistant hypertension, which is defined as failure to achieve goal blood pressure despite adherence to an appropriate, three-drug regimen including a diuretic. In a review of 1616 patients with resistant hypertension, 11 percent fulfilled criteria for primary aldosteronism; hypokalemia was seen in only 45 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-clinical-features-of-primary-aldosteronism/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=definition-risk-factors-and-evaluation-of-resistant-hypertension#H14\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Definition, risk factors, and evaluation of resistant hypertension&quot;, section on 'Primary aldosteronism'</a>.)</p><p>Rarely, hypertension is absent in patients with primary aldosteronism [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-clinical-features-of-primary-aldosteronism/abstract/38,39\" class=\"abstract_t\">38,39</a>]. In this setting, the blood pressure may become very low with relief of the aldosterone excess, suggesting that aldosterone excess produced the expected significant increase in blood pressure over baseline.</p><p>Even serum aldosterone levels in the high-normal range may be associated with increased blood pressure. This was illustrated in a report from the Framingham Offspring study in which baseline serum aldosterone levels were obtained among 1688 initially nonhypertensive participants (mean blood pressures of <span class=\"nowrap\">121/75</span> and <span class=\"nowrap\">117/71</span> mmHg for men and women, respectively) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-clinical-features-of-primary-aldosteronism/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>]. At follow-up at four years, an increase in blood pressure category or the development of hypertension had occurred in 34 and 15 percent of individuals, respectively. Compared with the lowest quartile of serum aldosterone (range of 2.0 to 7.0 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL),</span> the highest quartile (range of 14.0 to 60 and 72 <span class=\"nowrap\">ng/dL)</span> was associated with an increased risk of elevated blood pressure (1.60, 95% CI 1.19-2.14) and hypertension (1.61, 95% CI 1.05-2.46). Although these results are intriguing, interpretation of serum aldosterone levels requires knowledge of the exact level of salt and potassium intake and plasma renin values.

As an example, increasing sodium intake, and therefore distal delivery, will exacerbate the hypokalemia in this setting since aldosterone secretion will not be appropriately suppressed by the volume expansion [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-clinical-features-of-primary-aldosteronism/abstract/46\" class=\"abstract_t\">46</a>].</p><p>The fall in the plasma potassium concentration in primary aldosteronism is accompanied by <strong>metabolic alkalosis</strong>. This disorder is largely due to increased urinary hydrogen excretion mediated both by hypokalemia and by the direct stimulatory effect of aldosterone on distal acidification. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-of-metabolic-alkalosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis of metabolic alkalosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>For patients who do have hypokalemia, the plasma potassium tends to be relatively stable at least over the short term since the potassium-wasting effect of excess aldosterone is counterbalanced by the potassium-retaining effect of hypokalemia itself. Progressive hypokalemia does not occur unless some other factor is added, such as increased aldosterone production or the use of diuretic therapy (see <a href=\"#H586735300\" class=\"local\">'Renal actions of aldosterone'</a> above). The mechanisms by which hypokalemia limits further potassium wasting are discussed elsewhere.

Other cardiovascular risks include stroke, myocardial infarction, and atrial fibrillation:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective study compared 124 patients with primary aldosteronism to 465 patients with apparent primary hypertension who were matched for age, gender, and blood pressure (mean <span class=\"nowrap\">175/107</span> mmHg) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-clinical-features-of-primary-aldosteronism/abstract/50\" class=\"abstract_t\">50</a>]. The patients with primary aldosteronism had significantly higher rates of prior stroke (12.9 versus 3.4 percent in those with primary hypertension), nonfatal myocardial infarction (4.0 versus 0.6 percent), and atrial fibrillation (7.3 versus 0.6 percent). The rate of cardiovascular complications appeared to be similar in those with an adrenal adenoma and adrenal hyperplasia, but a rigorous distinction between these two subtypes was not pursued.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Similar findings were noted in a prospective study that compared 54 patients with primary hyperaldosteronism, who were treated with either surgical resection of an adrenal adenoma or the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist <a href=\"topic.htm?path=spironolactone-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">spironolactone</a>, with a control group with primary hypertension, matched for age, gender, body mass index (BMI), and duration of hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-clinical-features-of-primary-aldosteronism/abstract/52\" class=\"abstract_t\">52</a>].

During a mean follow-up of 7.4 years after treatment, a similar proportion of patients in each group (18.5 and 17.6 percent, respectively) reached the primary outcome, which was a composite cardiovascular end point of myocardial infarction, stroke, revascularization procedure, or sustained arrhythmia.</p><p/><p>Dietary salt may affect the impact of primary aldosteronism on cardiac damage. In a case-control study of 21 patients with primary aldosteronism and 21 control patients with primary hypertension, 24-hour urinary sodium excretion was an independent predictor for LV wall thickness and mass in patients with primary aldosteronism but not primary hypertension [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/pathophysiology-and-clinical-features-of-primary-aldosteronism/abstract/53\" class=\"abstract_t\">53</a>].

In addition, hyperaldosteronism was associated with tubular dysfunction as assessed with urinary beta-2 microglobulin excretion, which improved six months after surgery.

At baseline, the GFR and albumin excretion were higher in the patients with primary aldosteronism. In the first six months of follow-up, the reductions in GFR and albuminuria were significantly greater in the patients with primary aldosteronism, who also were more likely to have restoration of normal albumin excretion.

Age, male sex, low potassium, and high serum aldosterone concentrations were independent predictors of a lower GFR.
