DM, unlike PM, is associated with a variety of characteristic skin manifestations. A form of DM, termed amyopathic DM (ADM, also known as dermatomyositis sine myositis), is a condition in which patients have characteristic skin findings of DM without weakness or abnormal muscle enzymes. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of dermatomyositis and polymyositis in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The clinical and serologic features of DM and PM vary among affected individuals and populations, depending upon immunogenetic characteristics and presumably upon potential environmental triggers [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-in-adults/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>]. The immune mechanisms and anatomic focus of injury within the muscle tissue in PM and DM appear distinct. The other major type of idiopathic inflammatory myopathy is inclusion body myositis (IBM).

Certain aspects of the evaluation are particularly helpful because they may reveal characteristic historical features, physical findings, the extent of disease, and multisystem involvement. Additionally, the evaluation should help to differentiate patients with DM and PM from those with other conditions, including other systemic rheumatic diseases and metabolic, infectious, or malignant disorders, as well as neuropathies, neuromuscular diseases, and other myopathies, including drug-induced myopathy. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of dermatomyositis and polymyositis in adults&quot;</a> and <a href=\"#H23127552\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>History</strong> &ndash; Patients should be questioned regarding the duration, mode of onset, location, and severity of weakness and should be asked about their ability to carry out various activities that they commonly perform, such as climbing stairs, getting up from a chair, and carrying heavy groceries or other objects. The severity and distribution of myalgia, as well as the presence or absence of significant stiffness, should be assessed. True muscle weakness should be distinguished from complaints of fatigue or shortness of breath with exertion and from limitation due to joint disease.

Other symptoms of systemic rheumatic diseases, particularly systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and systemic sclerosis (SSc), that may identify an overlap syndrome should be sought, and patients should be queried about cutaneous eruptions, photosensitivity, Raynaud phenomenon, and other symptoms that may occur in DM, PM, or another systemic rheumatic disease. Patients should also be queried regarding whether they have been experiencing any symptoms suggesting malignancy and what screening and other testing has been performed. The timing of the use of any drugs that may cause myopathy, particularly statins, should be determined.

Characteristic findings on skin examination should be identified, if present, but they are sometimes subtle. A thorough examination of the skin should be performed with particular attention to the scalp, face, eyelids, hands, fingers, extensor aspects, and joints. A general physical examination should be performed, with particular attention to the heart and lungs, which should be carefully auscultated for evidence of interstitial disease. A thorough joint examination should be carried out to detect signs of inflammatory arthritis. A detailed neurologic and neuromuscular examination is critical to determine the severity and distribution of weakness and of muscle tenderness, as well as the presence or absence of other abnormal neurologic findings.

The usual muscle targets for biopsy are the quadriceps or the deltoid. Biopsying the muscle contralateral to one shown to be abnormal by electromyography (EMG) increases the likelihood of a diagnostic biopsy. We avoid muscles with severe weakness, marked atrophy, or recent EMG testing. In addition, biopsy of the calf muscles is discouraged because of the frequency of artifactual findings in biopsies from that region. (See <a href=\"#H5037117\" class=\"local\">'Electromyography'</a> below.)</p><p>If physical examination and EMG fail to identify an appropriate muscle for biopsy, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be useful. MRI may reveal areas of increased T2 signal in muscles that can then be selected for biopsy. Targeted study of the most accessible muscles (eg, deltoid, biceps, quadriceps) by MRI is one approach, but whole-body imaging is another option (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F51395\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef51395 \">image 1</a>) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-in-adults/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>].

Muscle biopsy via a small incision using local anesthesia and a sharp-jawed surgical instrument (conchotome) may also yield a diagnostically adequate specimen with a low complication rate. The efficacy of this technique was evaluated in a report in which 149 muscle biopsies were obtained from 122 patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-in-adults/abstract/21\" class=\"abstract_t\">21</a>]. Only four biopsies (2.7 percent) failed to provide an adequate sample for histologic analysis. Eighty-three percent of patients who met clinical criteria for definite or probable DM or PM had biopsies that revealed myositis.</p><p>Proper processing of the muscle biopsy is essential.

Additionally, in DM and PM, myalgia tends to be mild, unlike the more prominent muscle pain that occurs in polymyalgia rheumatica, fibromyalgia, and viral or bacterial myositis.

In contrast to PM, IBM generally has a more insidious onset and more prominent distal muscle weakness (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RHEUM%2F74076\" class=\"graphic graphic_table graphicRef74076 \">table 2</a>). Unlike PM, the combination of muscle atrophy and weakness of the wrist and finger flexors in the upper extremities with weakness of the quadriceps and anterior tibial muscles in the legs is characteristic [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-in-adults/abstract/29,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">29,30</a>].

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings may help to distinguish PM from IBM. Whereas MRI changes suggestive of inflammation are noted along fascial planes in PM, such changes are observed throughout the muscle in IBM [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-in-adults/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

Drug-induced myopathy can generally be distinguished from DM or PM based upon a careful clinical history of drug exposure, but, in patients in whom the diagnosis is uncertain, the distinction can usually be made by electromyography (EMG) and muscle biopsy if needed.

It may also be seen in association with an underlying autoimmune rheumatic disease, such as scleroderma or mixed connective tissue disease, may be seen as a paraneoplastic syndrome, or may be idiopathic.

Also, EMG findings are typical of an inflammatory myopathy, and muscle enzymes are elevated. In contrast to PM and DM, however, muscle biopsies show necrotic muscle fibers without significant inflammatory cell infiltrate around non-necrotic fibers, as well as a lack of perifascicular atrophy. Some of these patients exhibit antibodies to signal recognition peptide or to another antibody, <span class=\"nowrap\">anti-200/100</span> [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-in-adults/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>].

Coexisting clinical signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism, including delayed relaxation phase of the deep tendon reflexes, lack of fibrillation potentials on electromyogram with relatively normal appearing motor units, and the absence of inflammatory changes on muscle biopsy, all help to distinguish hypothyroid myopathy from polymyositis. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) measurement is the preferred screening test.

The myopathy either can be a presenting manifestation of HIV infection or can occur in the later stages of infection. With the widespread use of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART), though, it is an uncommon occurrence [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-in-adults/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>].

Immunosuppressive agents such as <a href=\"topic.htm?path=methotrexate-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">methotrexate</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=azathioprine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">azathioprine</a>, which are employed in this setting in idiopathic PM, should be approached with caution in HIV-infected patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-in-adults/abstract/40\" class=\"abstract_t\">40</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In HIV-infected patients with myopathy, other considerations include rhabdomyolysis and opportunistic infections (eg, toxoplasmosis). Older-generation nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, predominantly <a href=\"topic.htm?path=zidovudine-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">zidovudine</a>, have also been associated with a myopathy that improves with discontinuation of the drug. However, these antiretroviral agents are uncommonly used, particularly in resource-rich settings.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Myasthenia gravis</strong> &ndash; Myasthenia gravis is a disorder of the neuromuscular junction, caused by antibodies to the acetylcholine receptor. Although the classic physical examination finding in myasthenia gravis is muscle fatigability (the development of muscle weakness as exercise proceeds), the disease can occasionally cause diffuse weakness without prominent fatigability symptoms. Myasthenia gravis is distinguished from myositis by the frequent presence of facial muscle weakness, normal muscle enzymes, characteristic EMG changes, and anti-acetylcholine receptor antibodies. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-of-myasthenia-gravis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations of myasthenia gravis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">In contrast to myasthenia gravis, DM and PM rarely involve the oculobulbar muscles. A condition related to myasthenia gravis, known as the Lambert-Eaton syndrome, can mimic DM and PM more closely, because the oculobulbar muscles are usually spared. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=lambert-eaton-myasthenic-syndrome-clinical-features-and-diagnosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Lambert-Eaton myasthenic syndrome: Clinical features and diagnosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Muscular dystrophy</strong> &ndash; The muscular dystrophies are an inherited group of progressive myopathic disorders resulting from defects in a number of genes required for normal muscle function. Patients with muscular dystrophy occasionally have a prominent endomysial inflammatory cell infiltrate, which may cause diagnostic confusion with PM, particularly in dystrophic disorders such as limb-girdle and facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophies. However, the inflammatory cell infiltrate in muscular dystrophy is typically limited to areas adjacent to necrotic muscle fibers, in contrast to the tendency of PM to involve non-necrotic muscle fibers. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=limb-girdle-muscular-dystrophy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Limb-girdle muscular dystrophy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=facioscapulohumeral-muscular-dystrophy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy&quot;</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span><strong>Myotonic dystrophy</strong> &ndash; Proximal myotonic myopathy (PROMM), also known as myotonic dystrophy type 2, must also be considered in the differential diagnosis. It presents in adults, but, unlike in PM, the majority of patients exhibit myotonia, a slowed relaxation following a normal muscle contraction, and a family history of the disorder. There is often early involvement of the finger flexors in addition to proximal muscle groups, and other findings may be present, such as cataracts, mild cognitive impairment, and glucose intolerance. Genetic testing can confirm the diagnosis.

These diseases are characterized by intermittent episodes of acute muscle pain and tenderness, usually induced by exertion. The episodes are often accompanied by myoglobinuria with red or brown urine. Occasional patients develop chronic weakness after years of repeated acute episodes [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-in-adults/abstract/41\" class=\"abstract_t\">41</a>].

It is distinguished from DM or PM by the presence of other clinical and histologic manifestations of sarcoid. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=sarcoid-muscle-bone-and-vascular-disease-manifestations#H3\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Sarcoid: Muscle, bone, and vascular disease manifestations&quot;, section on 'Myopathy'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Trichinellosis &ndash; Parasitic infections, particularly trichinellosis, may cause severe muscle pain and enzyme elevations, but it is distinguished by the history of ingesting inadequately cooked meat and by the presence of eosinophilia.

Some patients present with distal involvement. The clinical findings in the setting of type 2 diabetes and the electrodiagnostic findings help to distinguish it from DM or PM. The diagnosis of diabetic muscle infarction is suggested clinically by the acute or subacute onset of muscle pain, swelling, and associated tenderness, often in the muscles of the thigh and calf, and may be confirmed by biopsy of the affected area.

Unlike in DM, a thicker, silvery or micaceous scaling may be present in psoriasis, and a more yellow, greasy scaling may be evident in seborrheic dermatitis. Unlike in DM, both scalp psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis lack any evidence of poikiloderma. Finally, scalp DM may be distinguished from both of these disorders on skin biopsy. The scalp disease in DM exhibits characteristic vacuolar interface changes, but psoriasis and seborrheic dermatitis do not.

These criteria are useful for clinicians in identifying key features of diseases, but their imperfect sensitivity and specificity limits their use for diagnostic purposes.</p><p>In 2017, the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) and the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) developed and validated revised classification criteria for adult and juvenile idiopathic inflammatory myopathies and their major subgroups [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-in-adults/abstract/51,52\" class=\"abstract_t\">51,52</a>]. These criteria address some of the shortcomings of previously used classification systems by capturing a broader spectrum of inflammatory myopathy patients and subgroups and by including more well-defined and easily accessible clinical and laboratory criteria [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/diagnosis-and-differential-diagnosis-of-dermatomyositis-and-polymyositis-in-adults/abstract/1,3,4,53-55\" class=\"abstract_t\">1,3,4,53-55</a>].

There are two different scoring systems depending on whether a muscle biopsy has been performed. A classification tree for the subgroups of idiopathic inflammatory myopathy is also provided to help distinguish adult from juvenile idiopathy inflammatory myopathy and then subclassify adult patients into polymyositis (PM), dermatomyositis (DM), amyopathic myositis, or inclusion body myositis. In addition, adult patients with pathognomic skin rashes (heliotrope rash, Gottron papules, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> Gottron sign) are classified with DM without including muscle biopsy data.

The evaluation of the patient suspected of having DM or PM begins with a careful history, a physical examination, and a laboratory examination, with particular attention to the following (see <a href=\"#H23127474\" class=\"local\">'Initial evaluation'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Characterization of muscle weakness, including assessment of severity and the degree of symmetry and of relative proximal versus distal involvement</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Skin examination</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Muscle enzyme measurement, including creatine kinase (CK) and aldolase, and general laboratory testing</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Systemic disease manifestations</p><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Exclusion of other diseases, including drug-induced myopathy and malignancy</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients in whom the initial evaluation is consistent with possible DM or PM, further studies should include testing for antinuclear and myositis-specific antibodies (MSA) and a chest radiograph. Additional diagnostic studies, including muscle or skin biopsy, electromyography (EMG), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of skeletal muscle, depend upon the clinical presentation. (See <a href=\"#H23127474\" class=\"local\">'Initial evaluation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5035129\" class=\"local\">'Further diagnostic studies'</a> above and <a href=\"#H23127503\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Histologic features of DM and PM include muscle fiber necrosis, degeneration, regeneration, and inflammatory cell infiltration. In DM, the cellular infiltrate is predominantly perifascicular and often perivascular. B lymphocytes and an increased number of plasmacytoid dendritic cells are also typical of DM. In PM, the cellular infiltrate in muscle is predominantly within the fascicle, in which there are increased numbers of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. Skin changes that are characteristic of DM have the histopathological features of interface dermatitis (ie, inflammation at the dermal-epidermal junction) with variable levels of dermal mucin deposition. (See <a href=\"#H5036844\" class=\"local\">'Muscle biopsy'</a> above and <a href=\"#H5037048\" class=\"local\">'Skin biopsy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>EMG shows evidence of muscle membrane irritability, usually including increased insertional activity, spontaneous fibrillations, positive sharp waves, and complex repetitive discharges. EMG findings are helpful in confirming the presence of a myopathic process and in indicating which muscle groups are most involved. This information can be valuable in selecting a site for muscle biopsy. However, EMG findings are not specific for either DM or PM, and the EMG is normal in approximately 10 percent of patients. (See <a href=\"#H5037117\" class=\"local\">'Electromyography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We diagnose DM without a biopsy in patients with symmetrical proximal muscle weakness, elevated muscle enzymes, a rash that is relatively specific for DM (such as Gottron's papules or a heliotrope rash), and the absence of another explanation for the findings, as well as in patients with findings of a typical rash, myositis-specific antibodies, and other features characteristic of the antisynthetase syndrome. (See <a href=\"#H178918124\" class=\"local\">'Highly characteristic clinical presentation'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients suspected of DM or PM based upon proximal muscle weakness, elevated muscle enzymes, and a nonspecific rash, we generally make the diagnosis based upon muscle biopsy findings, which can distinguish between DM and PM and between DM or PM and other disorders. An EMG and muscle biopsy should be performed in patients who have atypical findings or in whom the diagnosis is uncertain in order to exclude other diagnoses such as inclusion body myositis (IBM), a metabolic myopathy, or a dystrophy. In selected patients with characteristic cutaneous and histopathologic findings on skin biopsy, we may diagnose DM without a muscle biopsy. (See <a href=\"#H278172323\" class=\"local\">'Nonspecific but typical presentation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H278172459\" class=\"local\">'Atypical findings at presentation'</a> above and <a href=\"#H178918138\" class=\"local\">'Cutaneous features without weakness'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>DM and PM must be distinguished from other conditions that cause muscle weakness, with or without muscle enzyme elevation. The differential diagnosis of DM and PM includes other inflammatory myopathies, motor neuron disease, myasthenia gravis, and the muscular dystrophies. In addition, a variety of inherited, metabolic, drug&ndash;induced, endocrine, and infectious myopathies must also be considered. (See <a href=\"#H23127552\" class=\"local\">'Differential diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In patients diagnosed with DM or PM, further studies to exclude malignancy depend upon an individualized assessment of the patient's levels of risk for particular disorders. Patients with clinical evidence of other organ involvement, including cardiac, pulmonary, or esophageal disease in particular, should also undergo further evaluation to characterize abnormalities that may be present.
