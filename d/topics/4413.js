Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) is superior to CT for evaluating the biliary tract, but CT is useful for hepatic imaging and in cases where it is not clear whether a problem is originating in the liver, gallbladder, or bile ducts. CT, like magnetic resonance imaging, allows for a more thorough evaluation of the liver and other abdominal structures than ultrasound, and is less dependent upon operator skills. In contrast to ultrasound, successful CT of the liver can be obtained despite obesity, overlying bowel gas, or ascites.</p><p>This topic review will discuss some general principles of CT as it applies to imaging of the hepatobiliary system. A more complete discussion of the technique of CT scanning, MRCP, and hepatobiliary ultrasound can be found separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-computed-tomography-of-the-chest\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of computed tomography of the chest&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=magnetic-resonance-cholangiopancreatography\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ultrasonography-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Ultrasonography of the hepatobiliary tract&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">TECHNIQUE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A CT scan is created by passing fine radiographic beams through the patient, with rotating detectors located on the opposite side of the body to record the amount of radiation not attenuated by the tissues being imaged. This information is then processed by a computer that calculates the attenuation values with reference to a standard water value of 0 Hounsfield units.</p><p>Intravenous iodinated contrast material is used to opacify vessels and to determine the vascularity of lesions relative to that of normal liver parenchyma. The timing of image acquisition is crucial in hepatic imaging; images should be obtained during an interval of sustained hepatic enhancement before the equilibrium phase is reached (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=GAST%2F72112\" class=\"graphic graphic_algorithm graphicRef72112 \">algorithm 1</a>). At equilibrium, lesions may become isodense with the liver parenchyma, and therefore not visible.</p><p>Conventional CT scanners obtain a series of individual scans during suspended respiration. This incremental table-patient transport results in respiratory misregistration due to varying breath-holds during scans. Thus, anatomic fields may be omitted and data lost. Conventional CT scan, while a powerful diagnostic tool, is more expensive than ultrasound and involves the risks associated with radiation exposure and intravenous contrast material. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=radiation-related-risks-of-imaging\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Radiation-related risks of imaging&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pathogenesis-clinical-features-and-diagnosis-of-contrast-induced-nephropathy\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pathogenesis, clinical features, and diagnosis of contrast-induced nephropathy&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=immediate-hypersensitivity-reactions-to-radiocontrast-media-clinical-manifestations-diagnosis-and-treatment\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Immediate hypersensitivity reactions to radiocontrast media: Clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and treatment&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Dynamic CT involves the rapid infusion of intravenous contrast during incremental scanning of the liver; the contrast produces enhancement of the hepatic parenchyma, various phases of which are typically acquired (arterial and portal venous phases, for example).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Contrast material</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Delivery of intravenous contrast material may be as a bolus or continuous infusion in a biphasic or uniphasic manner. Hepatic enhancement depends upon the injected iodine load relative to body weight. Most protocols aim to deliver 42 to 50 g of iodine since patients with normal preexistent renal function have no change in serum creatinine levels for one to seven days after a 50 g iodine load.</p><p>Images are acquired during well-documented pharmacokinetic enhancement phases (arterial, portal venous, redistribution, or equilibrium) depending upon the specific tumor or perfusion abnormality being evaluated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/computed-tomography-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Images are acquired during the arterial phase to document tumor vascularity, arterial patency, and blood supply; this is most useful to identify lesions such as hepatocellular carcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/computed-tomography-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Images are acquired during the portal venous phase when portal opacification has reached a maximal level; this is most useful to identify lesions such as colorectal cancer metastases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/computed-tomography-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Images rarely are acquired during the equilibrium phase to look for markedly delayed retention of contrast material within fibrous tumorous or scarring. Homogenous delayed enhancement is suggestive of cholangiocarcinoma [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/computed-tomography-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].</p><p/><p>Common hepatic protocols administer contrast material at 3 to 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">mL/sec</span> and acquire images at 20 to 25 seconds (arterial phase) and 60 to 70 seconds (portal venous or redistribution phase) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/computed-tomography-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>].

This technique was developed to optimize detection and characterization of lesions that may be missed by conventional incremental contrast-enhanced CT [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/computed-tomography-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. The radiographic focus describes a spiral or helical path around the patient, allowing a more rapid and complete image acquisition. An entire liver can be imaged during a single breath-hold, thereby reducing artifacts due to nonuniform breathing. In addition, images can be obtained during both the arterial and portal venous phases. A volume of data is collected and axial slices are reconstructed at any selected thicknesses within the scanned volume [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/computed-tomography-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract/abstract/3,4\" class=\"abstract_t\">3,4</a>]. Multiplanar and three-dimensional images can be reformatted from the source data set.</p><p>Helical technology also permits single level multiscan or continuous data acquisition at a single anatomical level. In the liver this is used for lesion characterization and plays a diagnostic role in identifying hemangiomas and vascular metastases. This may be employed in patients known or suspected to have hypervascular neoplasms such as hepatocellular carcinoma, metastases from renal cell carcinoma, neuroendocrine (islet cell) tumors, breast cancer, melanoma, thyroid carcinoma, and sarcomas [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/computed-tomography-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>].</p><p>In a study of 21 patients with hepatic neoplasms (12 with primary hepatic tumors and 9 with metastases) the sensitivity of helical CT was 91 percent for nodules greater than 1 cm and 56 percent for nodules 1 cm or less [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/computed-tomography-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. False-positive findings occurred in 4 percent of lesions. These results compare favorably with the more invasive CT arterial portography.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h1\">CT ARTERIAL PORTOGRAPHY</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>CT arterial portography (CTAP) was used for the detection of intrahepatic tumors and portal vein obstruction, but because of its invasive nature and the improved resolution of the newest multi-row CT scanners, it is seldom used any longer in practice. CTAP involves portal enhancement of the liver by infusion of contrast material via an angiographically placed catheter in the superior mesenteric artery, providing good delineation of intrahepatic vessels and the hepatic parenchyma. Since most liver tumors receive an arterial blood supply, this technique enhances differences between the normal parenchyma and most liver lesions.</p><p>A variety of conditions can give false-positive images, including areas of fibrosis, focal steatosis, regenerative nodules, coexisting benign tumors (cyst, hemangiomas), physiologic variations, and subcapsular hemorrhage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/computed-tomography-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract/abstract/5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-9</a>]. This is a problem particularly in patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension, a significant issue since these are the patients at highest risk for the development of hepatocellular carcinomas.</p><p>False-negative CTAP is a problem in patients with cirrhosis and portal hypertension. False negatives are much less common than false positives, but can be seen with capsular and subcapsular metastases, peritoneal carcinomatosis, adenopathy, and lesions &lt;2 cm. In addition, studies are technically inadequate in up to 26 percent of cases.</p><p>Helical CT is now being used to perform CTAP, which reduces respiratory motion artifacts, allows for image acquisition during peak lesion enhancement, and allows reconstruction of images at arbitrary intervals to better center the sections over focal lesions. This technique has been reported to have a very high detection rate for hepatic metastases from colorectal cancer. Dual-phase CTAP (phase 1 scanning first 30 to 35 seconds after the administration of the contrast injections, phase 2 beginning 10 to 18 seconds after the end of phase 1) has a better detection rate for small (&lt;2 cm) hepatomas compared with single-phase CTAP.</p><p>Helical CTAP is currently the most accurate diagnostic modality for hepatocellular carcinoma and other hypervascular liver tumors [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/computed-tomography-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Given the invasive nature of this procedure, it is usually reserved for the following settings: when there is a strong clinical suspicion for hepatocellular carcinoma, despite negative results on other imaging modalities; and when the results of therapy would be altered based upon the detection of additional tumor foci [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/computed-tomography-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract/abstract/5-9\" class=\"abstract_t\">5-9</a>]. In many cases, magnetic resonance imaging has taken over the role when subtle liver findings require further characterization.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h1\">CLINICAL USE</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Aside from the importance of CT for detecting hepatic tumors discussed above, this section will briefly describe some of the other major clinical uses of CT in patients with suspected hepatobiliary disease. The use of CT and other imaging studies in the individual disorders is discussed in detail on the appropriate topic reviews.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CT or ultrasound can be used in the initial evaluation of the patient with obstructive jaundice, although CT allows a more thorough evaluation of structures outside the biliary tree including the pancreas, portal and retroperitoneal lymph nodes, and vascular structures [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/computed-tomography-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. When used with contrast agents excreted into the biliary system, CT cholangiography accurately depicts biliary anatomy and has been used for the workup of living donor candidates for right lobe transplantation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/computed-tomography-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>].

The scans can be performed quickly in relatively unstable patients, and large areas can be visualized while the patient holds a few breaths. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=initial-evaluation-and-management-of-blunt-abdominal-trauma-in-adults#H10\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Initial evaluation and management of blunt abdominal trauma in adults&quot;, section on 'Computed tomography'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CT can be used to detect liver abscess; it is better than ultrasound for identifying small abscesses, extrahepatic fluid collections and air, and calcification. In some cases, it may be difficult to differentiate a tumor from abscess; biopsy or aspiration may be needed. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyogenic-liver-abscess#H7\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Pyogenic liver abscess&quot;, section on 'Imaging'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Budd-Chiari syndrome arises from the segmental or global obstruction of hepatic venous outflow. The CT scan may identify the cause of obstruction, but is most likely to depict changes secondary to venous occlusion such as ascites and hepatic enlargement, especially in the caudate lobe. Intravenous contrast material must be used to demonstrate the characteristic patchy central enhancement with poor peripheral enhancement, and absence of contrast material in one or more of the hepatic veins. In chronic cases, the hepatic veins are usually not visualized, the caudate lobe is enlarged and enhanced, and the portal vein is patent. CT is not a useful technique for depicting the direction of flow in the portal vein, which may be reversed in patients with Budd Chiari; this will be best depicted on ultrasound using color flow and Doppler. Additional findings that may be identified include the cause of venous occlusion such as tumor growth into the hepatic vein (hepatoma, colorectal metastases, atrial myxoma, renal cell carcinoma, adrenal carcinoma), thrombus in the hepatic vein, constrictive pericarditis, or right heart failure. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=budd-chiari-syndrome-epidemiology-clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis#H9\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Budd-Chiari syndrome: Epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and diagnosis&quot;, section on 'Cross-sectional imaging'</a>.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CT is a useful technique for guiding fluid aspiration and drainage from the peritoneal cavity. However, the technique does not provide real-time image guidance and may therefore not identify a peristalsing loop of bowel entering the field to be aspirated. Time, lack of portability, and radiation exposure make ultrasound a superior technique for fluid aspiration.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Multidetector CT permits high-resolution and high-speed helical imaging of the entire liver during a single breath-hold and delineates fine vascular details [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/computed-tomography-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract/abstract/13-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-15</a>]. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=principles-of-computed-tomography-of-the-chest\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Principles of computed tomography of the chest&quot;</a>.) The precise three-dimensional relationship of the vasculature to the liver provides an explicit, noninvasive roadmap to the transplant surgeon. In addition, it also helps in identifying and characterizing liver lesions. Mild (&gt;25 percent), moderate (50 percent), and severe steatosis (&lt;75 percent) resulted in a drop of 6, 11, and 20 Hounsfield units of attenuation, respectively, when compared with normal liver [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/computed-tomography-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract/abstract/14\" class=\"abstract_t\">14</a>]. This offers the potential to obtain a noninvasive diagnosis of fatty liver. Sophisticated software also makes it possible to quantitate lobar liver volume, to perform a virtual hepatectomy, and to determine if the graft can be safely placed in the recipient's abdominal cavity [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/computed-tomography-of-the-hepatobiliary-tract/abstract/15\" class=\"abstract_t\">15</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H62998097\"><span class=\"h1\">SUMMARY AND RECOMMENDATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Computed tomography (CT) can be used to image the hepatobiliary system, with perhaps the exception of the gallbladder, which is better imaged with ultrasound.
