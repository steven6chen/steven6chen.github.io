They may also be seen in patients with chronic pancreatitis and in patients who have suffered blunt or penetrating pancreatic trauma. Endoscopic drainage of walled-off pancreatic fluid collections by expert endoscopists is an accepted alternative to surgery when intervention is indicated [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-walled-off-pancreatic-fluid-collections-efficacy-and-complications/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. Its advantages over percutaneous drainage are the ability to place multiple internal drains through one puncture site and the avoidance of the development of a pancreaticocutaneous fistula for walled-off pancreatic fluid collections that communicate with the pancreatic duct. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-pancreatic-pseudocysts-and-walled-off-pancreatic-necrosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of pancreatic pseudocysts and walled-off pancreatic necrosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>In the past, many of these lesions were referred to as pseudocysts. However, in 2013, the terminology used to describe pancreatic fluid collections that develop following acute pancreatitis was updated, and the majority of walled-off pancreatic fluid collections now fall into the category of walled-off pancreatic necrosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-management-of-walled-off-pancreatic-fluid-collections-techniques\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic management of walled-off pancreatic fluid collections: Techniques&quot;</a>.)</p><p>This topic will review the efficacy and complications of endoscopic management of walled-off pancreatic fluid collections. The classification of pancreatic cysts, the diagnosis of walled-off pancreatic fluid collections, and the techniques used in the endoscopic management of walled-off pancreatic fluid collections are discussed separately.

According to the revised Atlanta classification, inflammatory pancreatic fluid collections include acute peripancreatic fluid collections, pseudocysts, acute necrotic collections, and walled-off pancreatic necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-walled-off-pancreatic-fluid-collections-efficacy-and-complications/abstract/2\" class=\"abstract_t\">2</a>] (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=clinical-manifestations-and-diagnosis-of-acute-pancreatitis#H19602500\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Clinical manifestations and diagnosis of acute pancreatitis&quot;, section on 'Local complications'</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=classification-of-pancreatic-cysts\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Classification of pancreatic cysts&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Acute peripancreatic fluid collections occur in the setting of acute interstitial pancreatitis within four weeks of the onset of pancreatitis.

The majority of walled-off pancreatic fluid collections contains necrotic debris and is now classified as walled-off pancreatic necrosis rather than pseudocysts [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-walled-off-pancreatic-fluid-collections-efficacy-and-complications/abstract/3\" class=\"abstract_t\">3</a>]. </p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H112374025\"><span class=\"h1\">ENDOSCOPIC MANAGEMENT OPTIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If the decision is made to proceed with endoscopic management for a walled-off pancreatic fluid collection, there are two options: transpapillary stent placement and transmural puncture (often done with endoscopic ultrasound guidance). The choice of endoscopic procedure will depend on the clinical setting [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-walled-off-pancreatic-fluid-collections-efficacy-and-complications/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The endoscopic techniques for managing walled-off pancreatic fluid collections are discussed in detail elsewhere. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-management-of-walled-off-pancreatic-fluid-collections-techniques#H42782409\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic management of walled-off pancreatic fluid collections: Techniques&quot;, section on 'Choice of drainage procedure'</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">EFFICACY</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Transmural and/or transpapillary endoscopic drainage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Several studies have described results with transmural and transpapillary drainage performed alone or in combination. It is difficult to compare the efficacy between studies as there is a lack of standardization in reporting endoscopic success rates and complication rates, or in managing unresolved or recurrent walled-off pancreatic fluid collections. With respect to reporting technical success, for example, walled-off pancreatic fluid collections that do not have an endoscopically visible bulge would be excluded from series that used only duodenoscope-assistance. </p><p>The following illustrate findings in selected large series:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The efficacy of transmural (n = 20) and transpapillary (n = 33) drainage was described in an early series of 53 patients with a median fluid collection size of 7 cm [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-walled-off-pancreatic-fluid-collections-efficacy-and-complications/abstract/5\" class=\"abstract_t\">5</a>]. Resolution of the fluid collection was observed in 47 patients (89 percent). There was an 11 percent complication rate, and 11 patients (23 percent) had recurrences, many of which were managed endoscopically.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Subsequent series identified specific factors that were associated with higher rates of fluid collection resolution and lower rates of complications and recurrences. These included underlying chronic pancreatitis or trauma, a wall thickness less than 1 cm, and the absence of necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-walled-off-pancreatic-fluid-collections-efficacy-and-complications/abstract/6,7\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,7</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Another report described 116 patients who underwent drainage with a transmural, transpapillary, or combined approach [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-walled-off-pancreatic-fluid-collections-efficacy-and-complications/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>]. Successful resolution of symptoms and collections was observed in 88 percent of patients. Failure rates were significantly higher in patients with organized necrosis, but similar between acute and chronic pancreatitis. Those who underwent a combined approach had a higher rate of fluid collection recurrence in comparison with patients who underwent transpapillary or transmural drainage alone (27 versus 4 to 20 percent). One potential explanation is the transpapillary stent may hinder the maturation of the cystenterostomy fistula. Complications were observed in 11 percent of patients, including one death that was procedure-related.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A retrospective study evaluated the efficacy of combined transpapillary and transmural drainage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-walled-off-pancreatic-fluid-collections-efficacy-and-complications/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. One hundred ten patients underwent transmural fluid collection drainage. Forty patients (36 percent) underwent simultaneous pancreatic duct stenting. Treatment success was defined by complete resolution of the fluid collection or a decrease in size to less than 2 cm with symptom resolution. The success rate for patients receiving both transpapillary and transmural drainage was 98 percent compared with 80 percent in those treated with transmural drainage alone. However, the 70 patients who did not receive transpapillary drainage were those with complete ductal disruption, gastric outlet obstruction, altered anatomy, or an absence of a definitive leak, factors that may have decreased the likelihood of treatment success.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>A series with 104 patients with walled-off pancreatic necrosis who underwent direct endoscopic necrosectomy found that successful resolution was achieved in 95 patients (91 percent) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-walled-off-pancreatic-fluid-collections-efficacy-and-complications/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Patients required a median of three procedures with two debridements. Complications occurred in 14 patients (13 percent) and included five perforations, all of which were managed without surgery. There were also two deaths: one related to massive bleeding and one related to periprocedural hypotension and subsequent cardiac arrest.</p><p/><p>Transmural drainage has also been compared with surgical drainage. In a randomized trial, 40 patients were assigned to either endoscopic or surgical cystgastrostomy and followed for 24 months [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-walled-off-pancreatic-fluid-collections-efficacy-and-complications/abstract/11\" class=\"abstract_t\">11</a>]. Successful drainage of the fluid collection was achieved in all of the patients treated endoscopically with no fluid collection recurrences. Among the patients treated with surgery, there was one recurrence. Patients who were treated endoscopically had shorter mean lengths of hospital stay (two versus six days) and lower total costs ($7011 versus $15,052).</p><p>For walled-off pancreatic fluid collections that contain debris, placement of a nasocystic tube may improve the ability to resolve collections. In a retrospective study of 87 patients with walled-off pancreatic fluid collections that contained solid debris as determined by fine-needle aspiration of the fluid collection, patients who received transmural stents and a nasocystic tube were more likely to have successful drainage than those who received only transmural stents (79 versus 58 percent at 12-month follow-up), and the comparison approached statistical significance (p = 0.059) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-walled-off-pancreatic-fluid-collections-efficacy-and-complications/abstract/12\" class=\"abstract_t\">12</a>]. However, given the retrospective nature of the study and the lack of details on the degree of necrotic debris present as determined by endoscopic ultrasound, it is uncertain if the placement of a nasocystic drain would be necessary in patients with minimal (eg, less than 10 percent) necrotic debris. In addition, the overall resolution rate seen in the study is suboptimal, and whether direct endoscopic necrosectomy was performed was not detailed in the manuscript, which in our experience enhances long-term success.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h2\">EUS-guided drainage</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) provides visualization of the walled-off pancreatic fluid collection, even in cases where the fluid collection does not cause an indentation (bulge) into the stomach or duodenum. This facilitates drainage of these fluid collections, which are otherwise difficult to access. Advantages of EUS visualization include determination of the maturity of the fluid collection wall, assessment of the distance between the lumen and fluid collection, and avoidance of major vascular structures, including gastric varices. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-management-of-walled-off-pancreatic-fluid-collections-techniques#H42782425\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic management of walled-off pancreatic fluid collections: Techniques&quot;, section on 'Endoscopy-guided transmural drainage'</a>.)</p><p>Studies have reported technical success rates for EUS-guided fluid collection drainage of 84 to 94 percent, with fluid collection recurrence rates of 3 to 18 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-walled-off-pancreatic-fluid-collections-efficacy-and-complications/abstract/13-17\" class=\"abstract_t\">13-17</a>].</p><p>In a randomized trial that included 60 patients, EUS-guided drainage was compared with conventional (non EUS-guided) transmural drainage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-walled-off-pancreatic-fluid-collections-efficacy-and-complications/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>]. In that trial, the technical success rate was higher with EUS-guided drainage than with conventional transmural drainage (94 versus 72 percent). In addition, 8 of 29 patients (28 percent) assigned to conventional transmural drainage had non-bulging fluid collections and had to cross over to EUS-guided drainage because attempts at conventional transmural drainage failed. There was no difference between the groups with regard to complications. During short-term follow-up, the rates of fluid collection resolution were similar for those who underwent EUS-guided drainage and those who underwent conventional transmural drainage (97 versus 91 percent).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Fluid collection recurrence</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Recurrence after successful drainage of a walled-off pancreatic fluid collection by transmural EUS-guided drainage or surgery varies in the literature, but averages 10 to 15 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-walled-off-pancreatic-fluid-collections-efficacy-and-complications/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>]. However, a higher rate of fluid collection recurrence after endoscopic drainage has been noted in patients with a viable but disconnected segment of upstream pancreas. In one study, recurrence was seen in 11 of 22 patients with this so-called &quot;disconnected pancreatic tail syndrome&quot; [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-walled-off-pancreatic-fluid-collections-efficacy-and-complications/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>].</p><p>Some reasons for recurrence include undetected obstructing strictures, residual stones, or recurrent stones after successful duct clearance. Accurate visualization of the pancreatic ductal anatomy remains critical for minimizing recurrence of fluid collections.</p><p>Studies have looked at ways to decrease the rate of fluid collection recurrence. A trial of early removal versus delayed removal of transmural stents reported a lower recurrence rate if stents were left in place. Patients whose stents were left in place had a recurrence rate of 0 percent compared with 38 percent for those who had their stents removed after resolution of the fluid collection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-walled-off-pancreatic-fluid-collections-efficacy-and-complications/abstract/20\" class=\"abstract_t\">20</a>]. A large proportion of the recurrent cases were noted to have disrupted main pancreatic ducts with a disconnected tail.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h1\">COMPLICATIONS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Complications of endoscopic drainage of walled-off pancreatic fluid collections include secondary infection, immediate and delayed bleeding, perforation, and stent migration into the fluid collection cavity. The frequency with which these are reported in the literature (11 to 37 percent) varies due to a lack of standardization in reporting and differences in patient populations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-walled-off-pancreatic-fluid-collections-efficacy-and-complications/abstract/6,13,14,21,22\" class=\"abstract_t\">6,13,14,21,22</a>]. Higher complication rates have consistently been described in patients with underlying pancreatic necrosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-walled-off-pancreatic-fluid-collections-efficacy-and-complications/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>].</p><p>Complications can generally be treated medically or by repeat endoscopic therapy. Many can be anticipated and prevented by experienced endoscopists with careful attention to preprocedural imaging and details of technique.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Infection</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Infection is a common complication following endoscopic drainage of walled-off fluid collections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-walled-off-pancreatic-fluid-collections-efficacy-and-complications/abstract/23\" class=\"abstract_t\">23</a>]. Fortunately, the majority of infectious complications can be managed with antibiotics and endoscopic drainage. </p><p>Infection usually occurs for one of two reasons:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stent malfunction after transpapillary stent placement or uneven collapse and loculation following transmural drainage can produce occlusion and obstruction.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The presence of associated pancreatic necrosis, which increases the incidence of secondary infection following endoscopic drainage to nearly 50 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-walled-off-pancreatic-fluid-collections-efficacy-and-complications/abstract/24,25\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,25</a>]. In one review of patients with sterile pancreatic necrosis, five had an associated walled-off pancreatic fluid collection and underwent endoscopic drainage. After drainage, four of these patients developed pancreatic infection and underwent surgical debridement [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-walled-off-pancreatic-fluid-collections-efficacy-and-complications/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>].</p><p/><p>Peri- and post-procedural antibiotics are typically given to help reduce the risk of secondary infection of a sterile fluid collection. In addition, to minimize the risk of infection, we typically perform transmural puncture with tract dilation and placement of multiple stents whenever the fluid collection is greater than 6 cm in size or contains thick fluid or debris. Multiple sites of transmural puncture, sequential dilation of the cystoenterostomies, and endoscopic debridement may be required [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-walled-off-pancreatic-fluid-collections-efficacy-and-complications/abstract/24,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,26</a>]. The use of a nasocystic catheter for lavage can avoid stent occlusion and can help prevent loculation by keeping the fluid thin so that it drains easily. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-management-of-walled-off-pancreatic-fluid-collections-techniques\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic management of walled-off pancreatic fluid collections: Techniques&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Early recognition of underlying pancreatic necrosis, along with a commitment to intense endoscopic debridement and nasocystic or percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy lavage is necessary for successful endoscopic necrosectomy and to reduce the need for surgical intervention [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-walled-off-pancreatic-fluid-collections-efficacy-and-complications/abstract/24,26\" class=\"abstract_t\">24,26</a>]. Several studies have demonstrated successful management with conservative therapy such as additional endoscopic drainage [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-walled-off-pancreatic-fluid-collections-efficacy-and-complications/abstract/14,15,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">14,15,27</a>]. Radiologic drainage can be considered if a single loculation is noted in the periphery of the gland or if the loculated area is inaccessible to an endoscopic approach. Surgery remains the mainstay for multiloculated infected necrosis or for acutely ill patients who are unable to delay drainage for maturation of the wall surrounding the fluid collection.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h2\">Bleeding</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The most common cause of bleeding during endoscopic drainage is the inadvertent puncture of intervening blood vessels. Bleeding may also occur if a pseudoaneurysm is punctured. When bleeding occurs, infiltration of the bleeding site with a solution of 1:10,000 <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epinephrine-adrenaline-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">epinephrine</a> should be attempted, followed by endoscopic coagulation or hemostatic clipping. Rarely, angiography and embolization or surgery may be necessary to control bleeding [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-walled-off-pancreatic-fluid-collections-efficacy-and-complications/abstract/28\" class=\"abstract_t\">28</a>]. </p><p>Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) with Doppler flow-guided puncture is often performed to identify and avoid intervening blood vessels. An early technique of endoscopic drainage involved the extension of a transmural puncture with a papillotome. However, that method frequently resulted in bleeding from the gastric or duodenal wall. This complication has been reduced by the use of hydrostatic balloon dilation of the tract, with or without a small diathermic puncture. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-management-of-walled-off-pancreatic-fluid-collections-techniques\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic management of walled-off pancreatic fluid collections: Techniques&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The most serious, but fortunately rare, cause of bleeding is endoscopic puncture of unrecognized pseudoaneurysms. Prior to transmural puncture, a careful search for an unsuspected pseudoaneurysm should be undertaken with high-resolution, dynamic-bolus contrast computed tomography (CT) scanning. If further suspicion exists, the evaluation should include Doppler ultrasonography and, if necessary, angiography [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-walled-off-pancreatic-fluid-collections-efficacy-and-complications/abstract/29\" class=\"abstract_t\">29</a>].</p><p>Three clinical features suggest the possibility of a pseudoaneurysm (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=management-of-pancreatic-pseudocysts-and-walled-off-pancreatic-necrosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Management of pancreatic pseudocysts and walled-off pancreatic necrosis&quot;</a>):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Unexplained gastrointestinal bleeding</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Sudden expansion of a fluid collection</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>An unexplained drop in hematocrit</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h2\">Perforation</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Perforation is more likely when the fluid collection wall is poorly defined by CT or EUS, or has a distance of greater than 1 cm from the intestinal lumen. Puncture under such circumstances may result in leakage of the fluid collection contents <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pneumoperitoneum. In the absence of EUS, puncture should not be attempted if a visible endoscopic bulge is not entered during endoscopic needle localization. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=endoscopic-management-of-walled-off-pancreatic-fluid-collections-techniques\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Endoscopic management of walled-off pancreatic fluid collections: Techniques&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Perforation can often be managed conservatively but may require emergency surgery. This emphasizes the need for the multidisciplinary approach to managing walled-off pancreatic fluid collections. Although an early series reported a perforation rate of 11 percent, more recent series report rates of less than 3 percent, many of which can be managed conservatively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-walled-off-pancreatic-fluid-collections-efficacy-and-complications/abstract/8,13,15,21,30\" class=\"abstract_t\">8,13,15,21,30</a>]. Either direct puncture under EUS-guidance or endoscopic needle localization may help reduce this risk because the needle used to puncture the fluid collection can be left in place, helping to secure the endoscope to the fluid collection [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-walled-off-pancreatic-fluid-collections-efficacy-and-complications/abstract/31\" class=\"abstract_t\">31</a>].

(See <a href=\"#H7\" class=\"local\">'Complications'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Infection is a common complication following endoscopic drainage of fluid collections. Peri- and post-procedural antibiotics are typically given to help reduce the risk of secondary infection of a sterile fluid collection. Infection can often be managed with antibiotics and endoscopic drainage. (See <a href=\"#H8\" class=\"local\">'Infection'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The most common cause of bleeding during endoscopic drainage is the inadvertent puncture of intervening blood vessels. EUS with Doppler flow-guided puncture can help avoid accidental puncture of a blood vessel. The most serious, but fortunately rare, cause of bleeding is endoscopic puncture of unrecognized pseudoaneurysms. In many cases, the bleeding can be controlled endoscopically, though in some cases angiography with embolization or surgery may be required. (See <a href=\"#H9\" class=\"local\">'Bleeding'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Perforation is more likely when the fluid collection wall is poorly defined by computed tomography (CT) or EUS, or has a distance of greater than 1 cm from the intestinal lumen. Puncture under such circumstances may result in leakage of the fluid collection contents <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> pneumoperitoneum. Perforation can often be managed conservatively but may require emergency surgery. (See <a href=\"#H10\" class=\"local\">'Perforation'</a> above.)</p></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/endoscopic-management-of-walled-off-pancreatic-fluid-collections-efficacy-and-complications/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">Alali A, Mosko J, May G, Teshima C.
