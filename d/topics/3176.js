All three categories are encountered frequently in regions of the world where the incidence of TB is high and the prevalence of post-primary dissemination is common among children and young adults [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-nervous-system-tuberculosis/abstract/1-3\" class=\"abstract_t\">1-3</a>]. In regions where the incidence rates are low, such as North America and Western Europe, extrapulmonary manifestations of diseases are seen primarily in adults with reactivation disease, and the dominant form of CNS disease is meningitis.</p><p>The pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnosis, and treatment of central nervous system tuberculosis will be reviewed here. The general principles of treatment of TB are discussed separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=treatment-of-drug-susceptible-pulmonary-tuberculosis-in-hiv-uninfected-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Treatment of drug-susceptible pulmonary tuberculosis in HIV-uninfected adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">PATHOGENESIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>During the bacillemia that follows primary infection or late reactivation tuberculosis (TB), scattered tuberculous foci (tubercles) are established in the brain, meninges, or adjacent bone. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberculosis-natural-history-microbiology-and-pathogenesis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tuberculosis: Natural history, microbiology, and pathogenesis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>The chance occurrence of a subependymal tubercle, with progression and rupture into the subarachnoid space, is the critical event in the development of tuberculous meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-nervous-system-tuberculosis/abstract/4\" class=\"abstract_t\">4</a>]. The widespread and dense distribution of infectious foci seen in association with progressive miliary tuberculosis greatly increases the chance that juxta-ependymal tubercles will be established. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epidemiology-and-pathology-of-miliary-and-extrapulmonary-tuberculosis\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epidemiology and pathology of miliary and extrapulmonary tuberculosis&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Consequently, meningitis develops most commonly as a complication of progressive primary infection in infants and young children and from chronic reactivation bacillemia in older adults with immune deficiency caused by aging, alcoholism, malnutrition, malignancy, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, or drugs (eg, tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha inhibitors). Advancing age or head trauma may also lead to destabilization of an established quiescent focus resulting in meningitis in the absence of generalized infection.</p><p>The spillage of tubercular protein into the subarachnoid space produces an intense hypersensitivity reaction, giving rise to inflammatory changes that are most marked at the base of the brain. Three features dominate the pathology and explain the clinical manifestations [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-nervous-system-tuberculosis/abstract/4,5\" class=\"abstract_t\">4,5</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Proliferative arachnoiditis, most marked at the base of the brain, eventually produces a fibrous mass that encases adjacent cranial nerves and penetrating vessels.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Vasculitis with resultant aneurysm, thrombosis, and infarction affects vessels that traverse the basilar or spinal exudate or are located within the brain itself [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-nervous-system-tuberculosis/abstract/6\" class=\"abstract_t\">6</a>]. Multiple lesions are common, and a variety of stroke syndromes may result, involving the basal ganglia, cerebral cortex, pons, and cerebellum [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-nervous-system-tuberculosis/abstract/7\" class=\"abstract_t\">7</a>]. Intracranial vasculitis is a common feature of autopsy studies and a major determinant of residual neurologic deficits. In one autopsy study of 27 cases, for example, phlebitis and varying degrees of arteritis were demonstrated in 22 cases, including 8 patients with associated hemorrhagic cerebral infarction [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-nervous-system-tuberculosis/abstract/8\" class=\"abstract_t\">8</a>].</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Communicating hydrocephalus results from extension of the inflammatory process to the basilar cisterns and impedance of cerebrospinal fluid circulation and resorption. Obstruction of the aqueduct develops less frequently, from contraction of exudate surrounding the brainstem or from a strategically placed brainstem tuberculoma.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h2\">Host susceptibility</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The Toll-like receptor pathway appears to influence the susceptibility of man to tuberculous meningitis; this was illustrated in a case-population study design involving 175 HIV-uninfected patients with tuberculous meningitis, 183 HIV-uninfected patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, and 392 control patients [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-nervous-system-tuberculosis/abstract/9\" class=\"abstract_t\">9</a>]. A polymorphism in Toll&ndash;interleukin-1 receptor domain containing an adaptor protein that mediates signaling from mycobacteria activated Toll-like receptors was associated with susceptibility to meningeal tuberculosis (odds ratio [OR] 3.0) and to pulmonary tuberculosis (OR 1.6). The polymorphism was also associated with decreased whole-blood interleukin-6 production, suggesting immunomodulation as a mechanism for susceptibility.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6895684\"><span class=\"h1\">FORMS OF CNS TUBERCULOSIS</span></p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H22066703\"><span class=\"h2\">Tuberculous meningitis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tuberculous meningitis accounts for about 1 percent of all cases of tuberculosis (TB) and 5 percent of all extrapulmonary disease in immunocompetent individuals [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-nervous-system-tuberculosis/abstract/10\" class=\"abstract_t\">10</a>]. Although pulmonary TB in the United States has declined, the number of meningeal TB cases has changed little, and the case-fatality ratio remains relatively high (15 to 40 percent) despite effective treatment regimens [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-nervous-system-tuberculosis/abstract/10,11\" class=\"abstract_t\">10,11</a>].</p><p>Early recognition of tuberculous meningitis is of paramount importance because the clinical outcome depends greatly upon the stage at which therapy is initiated. Empiric antituberculous therapy should be started immediately in any patient with meningitis syndrome and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings of low glucose concentration, elevated protein, and lymphocytic pleocytosis if there is evidence of TB elsewhere, either clinically or historically, or if prompt evaluation fails to establish an alternative diagnosis. Serial examination of the CSF by acid-fast stain and culture is the best diagnostic approach. Smears and cultures will yield positive results even days after treatment has been initiated. Nucleic acid amplification (NAA) testing also may be helpful. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> below.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H99536894\"><span class=\"h3\">Clinical manifestations</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Typically, patients with tuberculous meningitis present with a subacute febrile illness that progresses through three discernible phases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-nervous-system-tuberculosis/abstract/12-15\" class=\"abstract_t\">12-15</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The prodromal phase, lasting two to three weeks, is characterized by the insidious onset of malaise, lassitude, headache, low-grade fever, and personality change.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The meningitic phase follows with more pronounced neurologic features, such as meningismus, protracted headache, vomiting, lethargy, confusion, and varying degrees of cranial nerve and long-tract signs.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The paralytic phase supervenes as the pace of illness accelerates rapidly; confusion gives way to stupor and coma, seizures, and often hemiparesis. For the majority of untreated patients, death ensues within five to eight weeks of the onset of illness.</p><p/><p>It is useful to categorize patients on presentation by the stage of illness, based upon the mental status and focal neurologic signs [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-nervous-system-tuberculosis/abstract/16\" class=\"abstract_t\">16</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage I patients are lucid with no focal neurologic signs or evidence of hydrocephalus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage II patients exhibit lethargy, confusion; they may have mild focal signs, such as cranial nerve palsy or hemiparesis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Stage III represents advanced illness with delirium, stupor, coma, seizures, multiple cranial nerve palsies, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dense hemiplegia.</p><p/><p>About one-third of patients on presentation have underlying generalized (miliary) tuberculosis, in which case careful funduscopic examination often shows choroidal tubercles (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=ID%2F61826\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef61826 \">picture 1</a>). These are multiple ill-defined raised yellow-white nodules (granulomas) of varying size near the optic disk. If present in a patient with meningitis, choroidal tubercles are a valuable clue to the etiologic diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberculosis-and-the-eye\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Tuberculosis and the eye&quot;</a>.)</p><p>Signs of active TB outside the central nervous system (CNS) are of diagnostic import if present but are often absent or nonspecific. Abnormalities on chest radiograph may be seen in half of cases, ranging from focal lesions to a subtle miliary pattern. A <a href=\"topic.htm?path=tuberculin-skin-test-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">tuberculin skin test</a> or an interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) will be positive in the majority [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-nervous-system-tuberculosis/abstract/12,13\" class=\"abstract_t\">12,13</a>], although a negative result does not exclude the diagnosis. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=approach-to-diagnosis-of-latent-tuberculosis-infection-tuberculosis-screening-in-adults\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Approach to diagnosis of latent tuberculosis infection (tuberculosis screening) in adults&quot;</a>.)</p><p>It is important to recognize cases with atypical features that mimic other neurologic conditions. Patients may present with an acute, rapidly progressive meningitic syndrome suggesting pyogenic meningitis or with a slowly progressive dementia over months or even years characterized by personality change, social withdrawal, loss of libido, and memory deficits. Less commonly, patients may present with an encephalitic course manifested by stupor, coma, and convulsions without overt signs of meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-nervous-system-tuberculosis/abstract/17\" class=\"abstract_t\">17</a>].</p><p>Paradoxical reaction (PR), an exacerbation of clinical signs (eg, fever, change in mentation) after beginning antituberculous chemotherapy, occurs in approximately one-third of patients with tuberculous meningitis and is not limited to HIV-infected patients (in whom PR is called immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome); predictors include female gender, concomitant HIV infection, and a shorter duration of illness [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-nervous-system-tuberculosis/abstract/18\" class=\"abstract_t\">18</a>].</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnosis of CNS TB can be difficult; maintaining a high degree of suspicion is vital in order to initiate therapy promptly. Diagnostic tools consist of CSF examination (including culture and nucleic acid testing) and radiography.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h4\">Spinal fluid examination</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The examination of cerebrospinal fluid specimens is of critical importance to early diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-nervous-system-tuberculosis/abstract/19\" class=\"abstract_t\">19</a>]. Typically, the CSF formula shows elevated protein and lowered glucose concentrations with a mononuclear pleocytosis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-nervous-system-tuberculosis/abstract/20,21\" class=\"abstract_t\">20,21</a>]. CSF protein ranges from 100 to 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> in most patients; however, patients with subarachnoid block may show extremely high levels in the range of 2 to 6 <span class=\"nowrap\">g/dL,</span> associated with xanthochromia and a poor prognosis. The CSF glucose is less than 45 <span class=\"nowrap\">mg/dL</span> in 80 percent of cases. The usual CSF cell count is between 100 and 500 <span class=\"nowrap\">cells/microL</span>.</p><p>Early in the course of illness, the cellular reaction is often atypical with only a few cells or with polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) predominance. Such cases usually rapidly change to a lymphocytic cellular response on subsequent CSF examinations. Upon initiation of antituberculous chemotherapy, the CSF of some patients briefly reverts to a PMN cellular reaction, associated with transient clinical deterioration (&quot;therapeutic paradox&quot;) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-nervous-system-tuberculosis/abstract/22\" class=\"abstract_t\">22</a>].</p><p>Measurement of the CSF adenosine deaminase (ADA) level may be a useful adjunctive test for diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-nervous-system-tuberculosis/abstract/19,23\" class=\"abstract_t\">19,23</a>]. However, elevated CSF ADA level may also be observed in the setting of bacterial infections [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-nervous-system-tuberculosis/abstract/23,24\" class=\"abstract_t\">23,24</a>], and there is no clear threshold to distinguish TB meningitis from meningitis caused by other infectious agents. One meta-analysis included 10 studies (most of which defined an elevated ADA as 9 or 10 <span class=\"nowrap\">U/L)</span> estimated the sensitivity and specificity of ADA for diagnosis of TB meningitis to be 79 and 91 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-nervous-system-tuberculosis/abstract/25\" class=\"abstract_t\">25</a>]. Another meta-analysis including 13 studies noted the sensitivity and specificity of ADA for diagnosis of TB meningitis depended on the definition of an elevated ADA level [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-nervous-system-tuberculosis/abstract/26\" class=\"abstract_t\">26</a>]. For ADA threshold of 4 <span class=\"nowrap\">U/L,</span> the sensitivity and specificity were &gt;93 and &lt;80 percent, respectively; for ADA threshold of 8 <span class=\"nowrap\">U/L,</span> the sensitivity and specificity were &lt;59 and &gt;96 percent, respectively.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h5\">Culture and sensitivity</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The importance of repeated, careful examination and culture of CSF specimens for <em>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</em> cannot be overemphasized. A large volume of CSF improves diagnostic yield. Some authorities recommend a minimum of three serial lumbar punctures be performed at daily intervals, although empiric therapy need not be delayed during this time. In one series, 37 percent of cases were diagnosed on the basis of an initial positive acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear; the diagnostic yield increased to 87 percent when up to four serial specimens were examined, even though antituberculous therapy had been administered before a positive smear was obtained in some cases [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-nervous-system-tuberculosis/abstract/13\" class=\"abstract_t\">13</a>].</p><p>In a study including 132 adults with clinical tuberculous meningitis, a bacteriologic diagnosis was achieved in 82 percent of cases; AFB smear and culture were positive in 58 and 71 percent of cases, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-nervous-system-tuberculosis/abstract/27\" class=\"abstract_t\">27</a>]. The sensitivity of the AFB smear of spinal fluid may be enhanced by attention to the following principles [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-nervous-system-tuberculosis/abstract/13,20,27\" class=\"abstract_t\">13,20,27</a>]:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is best to use the last fluid removed at lumbar puncture, and recovery of the organism improves if a large volume (10 to 15 mL) is removed.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Organisms can be demonstrated most readily in a smear of the clot or sediment.

General issues related to NAA tests are discussed further separately. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=diagnosis-of-pulmonary-tuberculosis-in-adults#H4154933816\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis in adults&quot;, section on 'Probe-based (NAA) tests'</a>.)</p><p>We are in agreement with the World Health Organization (WHO), which issued recommendations in 2017 favoring use of the Xpert <span class=\"nowrap\">MTB/RIF</span> Ultra assay (not available in the United States) as an initial test for diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-nervous-system-tuberculosis/abstract/36\" class=\"abstract_t\">36</a>]. This approach is supported by a single prospective study including 129 HIV-infected adults in Uganda with suspected tuberculous meningitis (22 with confirmed tuberculous meningitis) in which the sensitivity of Xpert Ultra for the composite endpoint of tuberculous meningitis was 95 percent; the sensitivity for Xpert or culture was 45 percent [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-nervous-system-tuberculosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>].</p><p>Use of the Xpert <span class=\"nowrap\">MTB/RIF</span> assay as an initial test for diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis is appropriate if the Xpert Ultra assay is not available and if the assay has been validated by the laboratory for this indication [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-nervous-system-tuberculosis/abstract/38\" class=\"abstract_t\">38</a>]. In one systematic review and meta-analysis including 18 studies, the sensitivity and specificity for the Xpert <span class=\"nowrap\">MTB/RIF</span> assay in CSF (compared with culture) were 81 and 98 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-nervous-system-tuberculosis/abstract/34\" class=\"abstract_t\">34</a>]. However, NAA tests of CSF have not been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration.</p><p>Other NAA tests have high specificity but moderate sensitivity in CSF [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-nervous-system-tuberculosis/abstract/39-41\" class=\"abstract_t\">39-41</a>]; in one study of the Modified Gen-Probe Amplified Direct Test, sensitivity and specificity in CSF were 59 and 100 percent, respectively [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-nervous-system-tuberculosis/abstract/39\" class=\"abstract_t\">39</a>].</p><p>An important consideration in the use of any NAA test for diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis is the negative predictive value (NPV). Test characteristics of the Xpert <span class=\"nowrap\">MTB/RIF</span> assay and other NAA tests suggest that these tests may be used to confirm the diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis when used together with traditional CSF studies but cannot be used to rule out tuberculous meningitis. However, the Xpert <span class=\"nowrap\">MTB/RIF</span> Ultra study in HIV-infected patients had NPV of 99 percent for definite tuberculous meningitis and 93 percent for definite and probable tuberculosis meningitis [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-nervous-system-tuberculosis/abstract/37\" class=\"abstract_t\">37</a>]. This test has promise for excluding a diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis if results are confirmed in other studies.</p><p>The assay MTBDRplus is a molecular probe capable of detecting rifampin- and isoniazid-resistance mutations (<em>rpoB </em>gene for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a> resistance; <em>katG </em>and <em>inhA </em>genes for <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoniazid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoniazid</a> resistance) [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-nervous-system-tuberculosis/abstract/42\" class=\"abstract_t\">42</a>].

In patients with tuberculous meningitis, CT and MRI can define the presence and extent of basilar arachnoiditis (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F98270\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef98270 \">image 1</a>), cerebral edema, infarction, and hydrocephalus (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=RADIOL%2F98269\" class=\"graphic graphic_diagnosticimage graphicRef98269 \">image 2</a>).

A similar syndrome may be encountered in patients with a parameningeal suppurative infection (eg, sphenoid sinusitis, brain abscess, or spinal epidural space infection).

On contrast CT imaging, early-stage lesions are low density or isodense, often with edema out of proportion to the mass effect and little encapsulation [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-nervous-system-tuberculosis/abstract/54-56\" class=\"abstract_t\">54-56</a>]. Later-stage tuberculomas are well encapsulated, isodense or hyperdense, and have peripheral ring enhancement.</p><p>Symptoms of systemic illness and signs of meningeal inflammation are rarely observed. Lumbar puncture is usually avoided because of concern for raised intracranial pressure and risk of brainstem herniation; in the occasional reported case where cerebrospinal fluid has been examined, the findings are normal or nonspecific. The diagnosis is made in relation to clinical, epidemiologic, and radiographic features or by needle biopsy. Unless the location of the lesion threatens obstructive hydrocephalus or brainstem herniation, surgical intervention should be avoided as it may precipitate severe meningitis.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6896376\"><span class=\"h3\">Differential diagnosis</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The diagnostic distinction between clinical tuberculoma and intraparenchymal neurocysticercosis (NCC) can be challenging, particularly in children.

(See <a href=\"#H1\" class=\"local\">'Introduction'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Clinical manifestations in patients with tuberculous meningitis progress through three phases (see <a href=\"#H99536894\" class=\"local\">'Clinical manifestations'</a> above):</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The prodromal phase, lasting two to three weeks, characterized by the insidious onset of malaise, lassitude, headache, low-grade fever, and personality change.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The meningitic phase with more pronounced neurologic features (eg, meningismus, protracted headache, vomiting, lethargy, confusion, and varying degrees of cranial nerve and long-tract signs).</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>The paralytic phase, in which the pace of illness accelerates rapidly; confusion gives way to stupor and coma, seizures, and often hemiparesis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Patients with tuberculous meningitis are categorized by stage on presentation, based upon mental status and focal neurologic signs as follows:</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Stage I patients are lucid with no focal neurologic signs or evidence of hydrocephalus.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Stage II patients exhibit lethargy, confusion; they may have mild focal signs, such as cranial nerve palsy or hemiparesis.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent2\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#8226;</span>Stage III represents advanced illness with delirium, stupor, coma, seizures, multiple cranial nerve palsies, <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> dense hemiplegia.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Tuberculomas are conglomerate caseous foci within the substance of the brain that develop from deep-seated tubercles acquired during a recent or remote hematogenous bacillemia. (See <a href=\"#H18643126\" class=\"local\">'Tuberculoma'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Spinal tuberculous arachnoiditis is a focal inflammatory disease at single or multiple levels producing gradual encasement of the spinal cord by a gelatinous or fibrous exudate. (See <a href=\"#H18643408\" class=\"local\">'Spinal tuberculous arachnoiditis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H36\"><span class=\"h2\">Diagnosis</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The diagnosis of CNS TB can be difficult. However, early recognition is of paramount importance because the clinical outcome depends greatly upon the stage at which therapy is initiated. (See <a href=\"#H12\" class=\"local\">'Diagnosis'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The examination of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) specimens is of critical importance to early diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis. Typically, the CSF formula shows elevated protein and lowered glucose concentrations with a mononuclear pleocytosis. (See <a href=\"#H13\" class=\"local\">'Spinal fluid examination'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>The demonstration of acid-fast bacilli (AFB) in the CSF remains the most rapid and effective means of reaching an early diagnosis. We recommend that a minimum of three lumbar punctures be performed at daily intervals, bearing in mind that empiric therapy need not be delayed during this time. (See <a href=\"#H14\" class=\"local\">'Culture and sensitivity'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>CSF specimens should be submitted for nucleic acid testing whenever feasible, particularly in the setting of high clinical suspicion and negative AFB staining. We are in agreement with the World Health Organization, which favors use of the Xpert <span class=\"nowrap\">MTB/RIF</span> Ultra assay (not available in the United States) as an initial test for diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis. Use of the Xpert <span class=\"nowrap\">MTB/RIF</span> assay is appropriate if the Xpert Ultra assay is not available and if the test has been validated by the laboratory for this indication. However, nucleic acid amplification tests of CSF have not been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. (See <a href=\"#H15\" class=\"local\">'Nucleic acid tests'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is superior to computed tomography (CT) in defining lesions of the basal ganglia, midbrain, and brainstem and for evaluating all forms of suspected spinal TB. (See <a href=\"#H16\" class=\"local\">'Radiography'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H37\"><span class=\"h2\">Treatment</span></p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend initiation of antituberculous therapy on the basis of strong clinical suspicion of CNS tuberculosis should not be delayed until proof of infection has been obtained (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). (See <a href=\"#H17\" class=\"local\">'Treatment'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We agree with recommendations of the American and British Thoracic Societies, Infectious Disease Society of America, and the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which recommend an initial two-month period of intensive therapy, with four drugs (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). For patients not known or suspected of being infected with a resistant strain, the preferred four-drug regimen includes daily <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoniazid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoniazid</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a>, <a href=\"topic.htm?path=pyrazinamide-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">pyrazinamide</a>, and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=ethambutol-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">ethambutol</a>. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Antituberculous therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Typically, intensive therapy is followed by a prolonged continuation phase lasting 7 to 10 months, depending on clinical response and established drug sensitivity of the isolate. The usual regimen in drug-sensitive disease is <a href=\"topic.htm?path=isoniazid-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">isoniazid</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a>, given daily or five times a week. (See <a href=\"#H18\" class=\"local\">'Antituberculous therapy'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>In the setting of known or suspected infection with an isoniazid-resistant strain, it is reasonable to increase the dose of <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rifampin-rifampicin-drug-information\" class=\"drug drug_general\">rifampin</a> and add a fluoroquinolone <span class=\"nowrap\">and/or</span> an injectable aminoglycoside to the initial standard treatment regimen. In addition, it may be advisable to extend the duration of therapy to 18 to 24 months, taking into account the severity of illness, rate of clinical response, and the patient's immune status. (See <a href=\"#H1478799925\" class=\"local\">'Drug resistance'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>We recommend adjunctive glucocorticoid therapy for all children and adults with convincing epidemiologic or clinical evidence for tuberculous meningitis (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=1\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1A</a>). Dosing is summarized above. (See <a href=\"#H30\" class=\"local\">'Glucocorticoids'</a> above.)</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>For human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients with TB involvement of the CNS who are not already on antiretroviral therapy (ART), we recommend deferral of ART until eight weeks after starting TB treatment, regardless of CD4 count (<a href=\"grade.htm?i=2\" class=\"grade\">Grade 1B</a>). Development of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome in patients with CNS TB may cause severe or fatal neurological complications. (See <a href=\"#H2988418581\" class=\"local\">'HIV coinfection'</a> above.)</p><p/></div><div id=\"topicAgreement\">Use of UpToDate is subject to the <a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/legal/license\" class=\"licenseLink\" id=\"sla_in_page\">Subscription and License Agreement</a>.</div><div id=\"references\" class=\"headingAnchor\"><h1>REFERENCES</h1><ol id=\"reference\"><li><a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/central-nervous-system-tuberculosis/abstract/1\" class=\"nounderline abstract_t\">al-Deeb SM, Yaqub BA, Sharif HS, Motaery KR.
