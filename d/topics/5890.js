There are several types of tendon problems (called tendinopathies):</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Repetitive activities and sudden trauma can injure tendons and lead to inflammation, pain, and difficulty using the joint. This is called <strong>tendinitis</strong>.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>As people age, tendons can break down (degenerate) or even tear; this is called <strong>tendinosis</strong>. Symptoms of tendinosis usually last more than a few weeks.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Less commonly, tendon problems can be caused by other conditions, including rheumatic diseases.</p><p/><p>Tendinopathies are common problems. The risk of having a tendinopathy increases with age and is greater in people who routinely perform activities that require repetitive movement that increases stress on susceptible tendons.</p><p>Treatment of tendinopathy focuses on resting and protecting the injured tendon so that it can heal, inflammation can resolve, and muscle strength can improve. In most people, tendinopathy resolves with little or no treatment.</p><p>Tendinopathy can affect many different tendons in the body. Separate articles discuss other types of tendon problems (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=biceps-tendinitis-or-tendinopathy-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Biceps tendinitis or tendinopathy (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a> and <a href=\"topic.htm?path=rotator-cuff-tendinitis-and-tear-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Rotator cuff tendinitis and tear (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>). More detailed information about elbow tendinitis is available by subscription. (See <a href=\"topic.htm?path=epicondylitis-tennis-and-golf-elbow\" class=\"medical medical_review\">&quot;Epicondylitis (tennis and golf elbow)&quot;</a>.)</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H2\"><span class=\"h1\">WHAT IS ELBOW TENDINOPATHY?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Tendinopathy (tendinitis or tendinosis) is the most common condition affecting the elbow.</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is called &quot;tennis elbow&quot; or lateral epicondylitis when there is an injury to the outer elbow tendon</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>It is called &quot;golfer's elbow&quot; or medial epicondylitis when there is an injury to the inner elbow tendon</p><p/><p>However, elbow tendinopathy can be caused by sports other than golf and tennis, as well as work-related activities that involve heavy use of the wrist and forearm muscles.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H3\"><span class=\"h1\">ELBOW TENDINOPATHY SYMPTOMS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Elbow tendinopathy most often affects the dominant arm (ie, the right arm in people who are right-handed, etc). Symptoms include:</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain in the elbow that spreads into the upper arm or down to the forearm</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Weakness of the forearm</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Pain can begin suddenly or can develop gradually over time</p><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>You might have a harder time with activities that require arm strength, including sports that require you to hit backhand or throw a ball</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H4\"><span class=\"h1\">ELBOW TENDINOPATHY DIAGNOSIS</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Elbow tendinopathy is usually diagnosed based on an exam and your description of pain.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H5\"><span class=\"h1\">ELBOW TENDINOPATHY TREATMENT</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>The treatments described can be categorized as those for short term pain relief (eg, pain medications, forearm brace, local injection) and those for improving long-term health of the tendons (eg, eccentric strength exercises).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H6\"><span class=\"h2\">Pain relief</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If needed, you can take a pain medicine, such as acetaminophen (sold as Tylenol&reg; and other brands), ibuprofen (sold as Advil&reg;, Motrin&reg;), or naproxen (sold as Aleve&reg;) (see <a href=\"topic.htm?path=nonsteroidal-antiinflammatory-drugs-nsaids-beyond-the-basics\" class=\"medical medical_patient\">&quot;Patient education: Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (Beyond the Basics)&quot;</a>). You should not take more than 4000 mg of acetaminophen per day. If you have liver disease or drink alcohol regularly, you should speak with your doctor or nurse before taking acetaminophen.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H7\"><span class=\"h2\">Arm brace</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A tennis elbow brace or strap applies pressure to the muscles of the forearm, reducing pressure on the injured tendon in the elbow. You can use the brace or strap while working or playing sports. Apply the brace so that the cushion is resting on your forearm muscles, about 3 to 4 inches (10 cm) from the tip of the elbow bone. You may need to wear the brace for up to six weeks. Avoid wearing a wrist splint (which prevents your forearm from moving).</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H8\"><span class=\"h2\">Flexibility exercises</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Flexibility exercises improve elbow and wrist mobility, and may help relieve symptoms in the short-term.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H9\"><span class=\"h3\">Tennis elbow</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>While standing or sitting upright, hold your injured arm straight out in front of you and point your fingers down toward the ground. With the hand of the uninjured arm, grasp the hand of the injured arm, thumb pressing on the palm, and try to bend the wrist further (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F65485\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef65485 \">picture 1</a>). Hold for 30 seconds; repeat three times. Perform this stretch daily.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H10\"><span class=\"h3\">Golfer's elbow</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Stand at arm's length away from a wall, with the affected arm closest to the wall. Place the palm against the wall with the fingers pointing down. Apply gentle pressure to the hand. Hold for 30 seconds; repeat three times. Perform this stretch daily.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H11\"><span class=\"h2\">Strengthening exercises</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>A special type of strengthening exercise, known as &quot;eccentric strengthening,&quot; is the most effective way to treat elbow tendinopathy. Patients can start these exercises once their flexibility has improved and they have little or no pain when performing a strengthening exercise. Eccentric strengthening involves working the affected wrist extensor tendon and muscle while they are lengthening. Patients can use a weight, elastic band, or a specially designed rubber bar to do these exercises, and they may be done under supervision or independently. Eccentric training was superior when compared to other types of strengthening [<a href=\"https://www.uptodate.com/contents/elbow-tendinopathy-tennis-and-golf-elbow-beyond-the-basics/abstract/1\" class=\"abstract_t\">1</a>]. This type of strengthening is important for improving the long-term health of the tendons.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H12\"><span class=\"h3\">Tennis elbow</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>People with tennis elbow should perform eccentric <strong>extension</strong> exercises (<a href=\"image.htm?imageKey=PI%2F81949\" class=\"graphic graphic_picture graphicRef81949 \">picture 2</a>). You should expect to feel some mild discomfort with these exercises. If the pain becomes sharp or is more than moderate, stop the exercise and rest for two to three days. Restart with fewer repetitions.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H13\"><span class=\"h3\">Golfer's elbow</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Golfer's elbow is treated with eccentric <strong>flexion</strong> exercises. You should expect to feel some mild discomfort with these exercises. If the pain becomes sharp or is more than moderate, stop the exercise and rest for two to three days. Restart with a lighter weight or fewer repetitions.</p><p>Sit with your arm supported (on a table) at shoulder height. The back of your hand should face the floor, and your hand should hang off the table. Start with your elbow bent, which is less painful, then progress to keeping your elbow straight. Hold a 1 pound weight in the hand. Using the unaffected hand, lift the hand with the weight toward the body (keep the arm flat against the table).</p><p>Move the unaffected hand away, and slowly allow the affected hand (with the weight) to drop. Repeat 15 times, then rest one minute. Repeat two more times. Perform five times per week.</p><p>After one week, try to lift the hand with the weight without assistance. Increase the weight by 1 to 2 pounds per week. Do not increase the weight unless you can complete 15 lifts.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H14\"><span class=\"h3\">Kinetic chain</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>If you play a sport that requires arm strength (such as tennis or golf), hold a 1 to 2 pound weight in your hand and reproduce the wrist and elbow motions of your sport. At the same time, brace your lower body and core (back and abdomen) muscles.</p><p>Then, replace the weight with a golf club or tennis racket and practice your swing (without the ball). If you do the exercises incorrectly, you may feel more pain. If you have pain with strengthening exercises, consider seeing a rehabilitation specialist, such as a physical therapist or athletic trainer, to help supervise your recovery.</p><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H15\"><span class=\"h2\">When will I feel better?</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Most people respond well to treatment. You might have some pain during work or sports for up to 6 to 12 weeks. Some people will need formal rehabilitation with a physical therapist.</p><p>If your pain persists, an injection into the painful tendon might help to relieve pain in the short-term. In addition, there are many new treatments being developed to promote tendon healing, such as using blood products, acupuncture, and nitroglycerin patches. Surgery is not usually needed unless symptoms have not improved after six or more months of treatment.

Use wrist supports when weight-training.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>When using tools, increase the gripping surface by wearing gloves or adding padding. Use a hammer with extra padding to reduce tension and impact. Hold heavy tools with two hands.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Use a two-handed backhand in tennis. When hitting a tennis stroke, use your entire lower body, hip, pelvis, and back, and use less of your elbow. Using the proper technique in tennis can help reduce symptoms. Reevaluate the size of your grip, string tension, type of string, new strokes, and new grips for new strokes, which can all contribute to problems.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\">Some suggest lowering string tension, finding the heaviest racket that does not affect your swing speed, finding the largest grip that is comfortable, and using softer strings.</p><p/><p class=\"bulletIndent1\"><span class=\"glyph\">&#9679;</span>Apply grip tape or an oversized grip on golf clubs.</p><p/><p class=\"headingAnchor\" id=\"H17\"><span class=\"h1\">WHERE TO GET MORE INFORMATION</span><span class=\"headingEndMark\">&#160;&#8212;&#160;</span>Your health care provider is the best source of information for questions and concerns related to your medical problem.</p><p>This article will be updated as needed on our web site (<a href=\"http://www.uptodate.com/patients&amp;token=nygaOTnDuGxGrKiuwLIxjMIsa91xyzRx3QvmgfDh4FTTVfpiGy3XGWFyzaLmJXXU&amp;TOPIC_ID=717\" target=\"_blank\" class=\"external\">www.uptodate.com/patients</a>).
